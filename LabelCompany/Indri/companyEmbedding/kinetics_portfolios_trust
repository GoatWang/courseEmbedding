PROSPECTUS



DECEMBER 29, 2000



EXPLANATORY NOTE



This Prospectus is being filed as a part of the Registration Statement filed by
the Trust pursuant to Section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended ("1940 Act"). Nevertheless, beneficial interests of each portfolio
series of the Trust are not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "1933 Act"), because such interests are issued solely to
eligible investors in private placement transactions that do not involve any
"public offering" within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act.
Accordingly, investments in any of the portfolio series of the Trust described
hereunder may currently be made only by regulated investment companies,
unregulated foreign investment companies, U.S. and non-U.S. institutional
investors, S corporations, segregated asset accounts, and certain qualified
pension and retirement plans. No part of this Prospectus or of the Trust's
Registration Statement constitutes an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an
offer to buy any beneficial interests of any of the portfolio series described
hereunder or any other portfolio series of the Trust.


Responses to Items 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 of Part A and Items 23(e) and (i)-(k) of
Part C have been omitted pursuant to paragraph B.2.(b) of the General
Instructions to Form N-1A.


THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS NOT APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THESE
SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO
THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE INTERNET PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Internet Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital. The Internet Portfolio seeks to obtain current income as a secondary
objective.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Internet Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Internet Portfolio's total assets will be
invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as American
Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") and International Depositary Receipts ("IDRs"), of
U.S. and foreign companies that are engaged in the Internet or are otherwise
engaged in Internet-related activities. The Internet Portfolio may also write
and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment.


The investment adviser believes that the Internet offers unique investment
opportunities due to its ever-growing use and popularity among business and
personal users alike. The Internet is a collection of connected computers that
allows commercial and professional organizations, educational institutions,
government agencies and consumers to communicate electronically, access and
share information and conduct business around the world.


Internet Portfolio securities will be selected by the investment adviser from
companies that are engaged in the development of hardware, software and
telecommunications solutions that enable the transaction of business on the
Internet by individuals and companies engaged in private and commercial use of
the Internet as well as companies that offer products and services primarily via
the Internet. Accordingly, the Internet Portfolio seeks to invest in the equity
securities of companies whose research and development efforts may result in
higher stock values. These companies may be large, medium or small in size if,
in the investment adviser's opinion, they meet the Internet Portfolio's
investment criteria. Such companies include, but are not limited to, the
following:


o    CONTENT DEVELOPERS: Companies that supply proprietary information and
entertainment content, such as games, music, video, graphics, news, etc.
on the Internet.


o    COMPUTER HARDWARE: Companies that develop and produce computer and network
hardware such as modems, switchers and routers, and those that develop and
manufacture workstations and personal communications systems used to access
the Internet and provide Internet services.


o    COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Companies that produce, manufacture and develop tools to
access the Internet, enable Internet users to enhance the speed, integrity
and storage of data on the Internet, facilitate information distribution
and gathering on the Internet, and secure Internet-based transactions.


o    VENTURE CAPITAL: Companies that invest in pre-IPO and start-up stage
companies with business  models related to the internet.


o    INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS: Companies that provide users with access to the
Internet.


o    INTERNET PORTALS: Companies that provide users with search-engine services
to access various sites by category on the Internet.


o    WIRELESS/BROADBAND ACCESS: Companies that provide the infrastructure to
enable high-speed and wireless communication of data via the Internet.


o    E-COMMERCE: Companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenue
from sales of products and services conducted via the Internet.


o    TELECOMMUNICATIONS: Companies that are primarily engaged in the development
of the telecommunications transmission lines and software technologies that
enhance the reach and bandwidth of Internet users.


The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and business model as well as its ability to grow and expand its
activities via the Internet or achieve a competitive advantage in
cost/profitability and brand image leveraging via use of the Internet. The
investment adviser also considers a company's fundamentals by reviewing its
balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends. Furthermore, the
investment adviser looks at the amount of capital a company currently spends on
research and development. The investment adviser believes that dollars invested
in research and development today frequently have significant bearing on future
growth.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Internet Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Internet Portfolio
may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity.
Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Internet Portfolio engages in a temporary, defensive
strategy, the Internet Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Internet Portfolio are listed
below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and the value
of the Internet Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Internet Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could
lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Internet Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to
industry specific developments. Companies in the same or similar industries
may share common characteristics and are more likely to react comparably to
industry specific market or economic developments.


o    INTERNET INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that conduct business on the
Internet or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from
Internet-related activities in general are subject to a rate of change in
technology and competition which is generally higher than that of other
industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Internet Portfolio may invest in
the equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies. Small and
medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Internet Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Internet Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with
investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political
and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and
less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Internet Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common stock of
any single issuer, which may make the value of the Internet Portfolio's
shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a diversified
mutual und.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Internet Portfolio may write and sell options
on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct
investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect
correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying
asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Infrastructure Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Infrastructure Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Infrastructure Portfolio's total assets will
be invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs,
of U.S. and foreign companies that are engaged in the development and
implementation of hardware, software and communications technologies that
support the growing infrastructure and activities of the Internet. The
Infrastructure Portfolio may also write and sell options on securities in which
it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment.


The investment adviser believes that the Internet offers unique investment
opportunities due to its ever-growing use and popularity among business and
personal users alike. The Internet is a collection of connected computers that
allows commercial and professional organizations, educational institutions,
government agencies and consumers to communicate electronically, access and
share information and conduct business around the world.


Infrastructure Portfolio securities will be selected by the investment adviser
from companies that provide hardware, software and telecommunications solutions
that enable the transaction of business on the Internet by individuals and
companies engaged in private and commercial use of the Internet. These companies
may be large, medium or small in size if, in the investment adviser's opinion,
the companies meet the Infrastructure Portfolio's investment criteria. Such
companies include, but are not limited to the following:


o    COMPUTER HARDWARE: Companies that develop and produce computer and network
hardware such as modems, switchers and routers, and those that develop and
manufacture workstations and personal communications systems used to access
the Internet services.


o    COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Companies that produce, manufacture and develop tools to
access the Internet, enable Internet users to enhance the speed, integrity
and storage of data on the Internet, facilitate information distribution
and gathering on the Internet, and secure Internet-based transactions.


o    WIRELESS/BROADBAND ACCESS: Companies that provide the infrastructure to
enable high-speed and wireless communication of data via the Internet.


o    E-COMMERCE: Companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenue
from sales of services conducted via the internet.


o    TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES: Companies that are primarily engaged in the
development of the telecommunications transmission lines and software
technologies that enhance the reach and bandwidth of Internet users.


The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and both the current percentage and growth in percentage of
resources that it spends in the Internet infrastructure marketplace. The
investment adviser also considers a company's fundamentals by reviewing its
balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Infrastructure Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality
U.S. short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Infrastructure
Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain
liquidity. Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Infrastructure Portfolio engages in a temporary,
defensive strategy, the Infrastructure Portfolio may not achieve its investment
objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Infrastructure Portfolio are
listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and
value of the Infrastructure Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Infrastructure Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Infrastructure Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a

o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Infrastructure Portfolio may
invest in the equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies.
Small and medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more
limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Infrastructure Portfolio's portfolio.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Infrastructure Portfolio may invest in
foreign securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks
than those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated
with investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations,
political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting
standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Infra-structure Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common
stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Infrastructure
Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a
diversified mutual fund.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Infrastructure Portfolio may write and sell
options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the
imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the
underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE EMERGING GROWTH PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Emerging Growth Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Emerging Growth Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Emerging Growth Portfolio's total assets will
be invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs of
small and medium capitalization emerging companies that are engaged in the
Internet and Internet-related activities. The Emerging Growth Portfolio may also
write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes
and/or direct investment.


The investment adviser believes that the Internet offers unique investment

government agencies and consumers to communicate electronically, access and
share information and conduct business around the world.

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Emerging Growth Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality
U.S. short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Emerging
Growth Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to
maintain liquidity. Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

To the extent that the Emerging Growth Portfolio engages in a temporary,

PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Emerging Growth Portfolio are
listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and
value of the Emerging Growth Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Emerging Growth Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Emerging Growth Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio

technology and competition which is generally higher than that of other

o    EMERGING, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Emerging Growth
Portfolio invests in the equity securities of emerging, small and
medium-size companies.  Small and medium-size companies generally have a
market capitalization of less than $5 billion.  Emerging companies are
those with operating histories of less than three years.  Investing in
emerging, small and medium-size companies presents greater risks than
investing in securities of larger, more established companies.  These
companies may be developing or marketing new products or services for which
markets are not yet established and may never be established. They may also
lack depth or experience of management and may have difficulty generating
or obtaining funds necessary for growth and development of their business.
Due to these and other factors, these companies may suffer significant
losses.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Emerging Growth Portfolio may invest in
foreign securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks
than those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated
with investing in foreign securities include currency fluctuations,
political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting
standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.

Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a

o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Emerging Growth Portfolio may write and sell
options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the
imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the
underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE GLOBAL GROWTH PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Global Growth Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Global Growth Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Global Growth Portfolio's total assets will
be invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs,
of companies in at least three different countries that are engaged in the
Internet and Internet-related activities. The Global Growth Portfolio may also
write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes
and/or direct investment.


The investment adviser believes that the Internet offers unique investment
opportunities due to its ever-growing use and popularity among business and
personal users alike. The Internet is a collection of connected computers that
allows commercial and professional organizations, educational institutions,
government agencies and consumers to communicate electronically, access and
share information and conduct business around the world.


Global Growth Portfolio securities will be selected by the investment adviser
from U.S. and international companies that are engaged in the development of
hardware, software and telecommunications solutions that enable the transaction
of business on the Internet by individuals and companies engaged in private and
commercial use of the Internet as well as companies that offer products and
services primarily via the Internet. These companies may be large, medium or
small in size if, in the investment adviser's opinion, the companies meet the
Global Growth Portfolio's investment criteria. Accordingly, the Global Growth
Portfolio seeks to invest in the equity securities of companies whose research
and development efforts may result in higher stock values. Such companies
include, but are not limited to, the following:


o    CONTENT DEVELOPERS: Companies that supply proprietary information and
entertainment content, such as games, music, video, graphics, news, etc. on
the Internet.

access the Internet, enable Internet users to enhance the speed, integrity
and storage of data on the Internet, facilitate information distribution
and gathering on the Internet, and to secure Internet-based transactions.


o    VENTURE CAPITAL: Companies that invest in pre-IPO and start-up stage
companies with business models related to the Internet.


o    INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS: Companies that provide users with access to the
Internet.


o    INTERNET PORTALS: Companies that provide users with search-engine services
to access various sites by category on the Internet.

of the telecommunications transmission lines and software technologies that

growth.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Global Growth Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Global Growth
Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain
liquidity. Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Global Growth Portfolio engages in a temporary, defensive
strategy, the Global Growth Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Global Growth Portfolio are
listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and
value of the Global Growth Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Global Growth Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Global Growth Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry related securities will decline in price due
to industry specific developments. Companies in the same or similar
industries may share common characteristics and are more likely to react
comparably to industry specific market or economic developments.


o    INTERNET INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that conduct business on the
Internet or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from
Internet-related activities in general are subject to a rate of change in
technology and competition which is generally higher than that of other
industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Global Growth Portfolio may invest
in the equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies. Small
and medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Global Growth Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Global Growth Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with
investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political
and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and
less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Global Growth Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common
stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Global Growth
Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a
diversified mutual fund.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Global Growth Portfolio may write and sell
options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the
imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the
underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE NEW PARADIGM PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the New Paradigm Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the New Paradigm Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the New Paradigm Portfolio's total assets will be
invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs,
of U.S. and foreign companies. The New Paradigm Portfolio will invest in
companies that the investment adviser believes will reduce their costs, extend
the reach of their distribution channels and experience significant growth in
their assets or revenues as a result of increased involvement in, or growth of,
the Internet. The New Paradigm Portfolio may also write and sell options on
securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment.


The investment adviser believes that the Internet offers unique investment
opportunities due to its ever-growing use and popularity among business and
personal users alike. The Internet is a collection of connected computers that
allows commercial and professional organizations, educational institutions,
government agencies and consumers to communicate electronically, access and
share information and conduct business around the world.


New Paradigm Portfolio securities will be selected by the investment adviser
from companies that are engaged in various industries where the growth of the
Internet will facilitate an increase in the growth of traditional business
lines, entry into new distribution channels, an ability to leverage brand
identity, and an improvement in the underlying cost/profitability dynamics of
the business. These companies may be large, medium or small in size if, in the
investment adviser's opinion, these companies meet the New Paradigm Portfolio's
investment criteria. Accordingly, the New Paradigm Portfolio seeks to invest in
the equity securities of companies whose research and development efforts may
result in higher stock values. Such companies include, but are not limited to,
the following:


o    RETAILERS: Companies that sell retail products and services via traditional
stores, catalogues, telemarketing, and web-site means.

The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and traditional business lines as well as its ability to expand its
activities via the Internet or achieve a competitive advantage in
cost/profitability and brand image leveraging via use of the Internet. The
investment adviser also considers a company's fundamentals by reviewing its
balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the New
Paradigm Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The New Paradigm
Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain
liquidity. Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the New Paradigm Portfolio engages in a temporary, defensive
strategy, the New Paradigm Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the New Paradigm Portfolio are listed
below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of
the New Paradigm Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the New Paradigm Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the New Paradigm Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related securities will decline in price due
to industry specific developments. Companies in the same or similar
industries may share common characteristics and are more likely to react
comparably to industry specific market or economic developments.


o    INTERNET INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that conduct business on the
Internet or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from
Internet-related activities in general are subject to a rate of change in
technology and competition which is generally higher than that of other
industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The New Paradigm Portfolio may invest
in the equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies. Small
and medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the New Paradigm Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The New Paradigm Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with
investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political
and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and
less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the New Paradigm Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common stock
of any single issuer, which may make the value of the New Paradigm
Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a
diversified mutual fund.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The New Paradigm Portfolio may write and sell
options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the
imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the
underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE MEDICAL PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Medical Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Medical Portfolio's investment objective, at least 65% of the
Portfolio's total assets will be invested in common stocks, convertible
securities, warrants and other equity securities having the characteristics of
common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs, of U.S. and foreign companies engaged in
the medical research, pharmaceutical and technology industries and related
medical technology industries, generally, with an emphasis toward companies
engaged in cancer research and drug development. The Medical Portfolio may also
write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes
and/or direct investment.


The Medical Portfolio's investment adviser believes that favorable investment
opportunities are available through companies that are developing technology,
products, and/or services for cancer research and treatment and related medical
activities. Accordingly, the Medical Portfolio seeks to invest in the equity
securities of companies whose research and development efforts may result in
higher stock values.


Medical Portfolio securities will be selected from companies that are engaged in
the medical industry generally, including companies engaged in cancer research
and treatment, biopharmaceutical research and the development of medical
instruments for therapeutic purposes. These companies may be large, medium or
small in size if in the investment adviser's opinion, the companies meet the
Medical Portfolio's investment criteria. Such companies include, but are not
limited to the following:


o    PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT: Companies that develop drugs and medications
for the treatment and prevention of cancer and other disease.


o    SURGICAL AND MEDICAL INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURERS AND DEVELOPERS: Companies
that produce, manufacture and develop the tools used by health care
providers in the delivery of medical care and procedures for the treatment
of cancer and other diseases.


o    PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS: Companies that primarily engage in the mass
production of existing drugs and medicines including drugs and medicines
for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.


o    BIOTECH & MEDICAL RESEARCH: Companies that primarily research and develop
new methods and procedures in the provision of health care related services
for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.


The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and resources that it currently expends on research and development
looking for a significant percentage, or large amount, of capital invested into
research and treatment of cancer and other diseases. The investment adviser also
considers a company's fundamentals by reviewing its balance sheets, corporate
revenues, earnings and dividends. The investment advisor also looks at the
amount of capital a company spends on research and development because the
investment adviser believes that such expenditures frequently have significant
bearing on future growth.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Medical Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Medical Portfolio
may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity.
Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptances

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Medical Portfolio engages in a temporary, defensive
strategy, the Medical Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Medical Portfolio are listed
below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of
the Medical Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Medical Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could
lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The stocks selected by the investment adviser may
decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general
is rising and may fail to meet the Medical Portfolio's investment
objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to
industry-specific developments. Companies in the same or similar industries
may share common characteristics and are more likely to react to
industry-specific market or economic developments.


o    SPECIFIC RISKS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY: Medical and pharmaceutical-related
companies in general are subject to the rate of change in technology, which
is generally higher than that of other industries. Similarly, cancer
research-related industries use many products and services of companies
engaged in the medical and pharmaceutical related activities and are also
subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by
progressive scientific and technological advances. Further, the medical
research and development industry is subject to strict regulatory scrutiny
and ongoing legislative action.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Medical Portfolio may invest in
the stocks of small, medium and large-size companies. Small and medium-size
companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and
financial resources than larger, more established companies. As a result,
their performance can be more volatile and they face a greater risk of
business failure, which could increase the volatility of the Medical
Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Medical Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks include currency
fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial
reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Medical Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common stock of
any single issuer, which may make the value of the Medical Portfolio's
shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a more diversified
mutual fund.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Medical Portfolio may write and sell options
on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct
investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect
correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying
asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE ENERGY PORTFOLIO









INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Energy Portfolio is long-term growth of capital.
The Energy Portfolio seeks to obtain current income as a secondary objective.






PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Energy Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Energy Portfolio's total assets will be
invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as American
Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") and International Depositary Receipts ("IDRs"), of
U.S. and foreign companies that are engaged in the field of energy generation,
exploration, distribution, equipment development and a range of alternative
energy-related research and technologies. The Energy Portfolio may also write
and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. The investment adviser believes that the field of energy
offers unique investment opportunities because of increasing demand and
developing scarcities of traditional energy sources.


Energy Portfolio securities will be selected by the investment adviser from
companies that are engaged in the development, refinement, distribution and
exploration of energy resources, and the developemtn of alterntive energy
resources and technologies. These companies may be large, medium or small in
size if, in the investment adviser's opinion, they meet the Portfolio's
investment criteria. Such companies include, but are not limited to, the
following:


o    Fossil fuel providers and explorers.


o    Alternative energy research and development, and commercialization firms.


o    Energy infrastructure builders.


o    Independent energy providers.


The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and business model as well as its ability to grow and expand or
achieve a competitive advantage in cost/profitability and brand image in the
energy field. The investment adviser also considers a company's fundamentals by
reviewing its balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends.
Furthermore, the investment adviser looks at the amount of capital a company
spends on research and development. The investment adviser believes that dollars
invested in research and development today frequently have significant bearing
on future growth.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Energy Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Internet Portfolio
may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity.
Some of these short-term instruments include:


o    commercial paper


o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance


o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)


o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Energy Portfolio engages in a temporary, defensive
strategy, the Energy Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Energy Portfolio are listed below
and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and the value of
the Energy Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Energy Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could
lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Energy Portfolio's investment
objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to
industry specific developments. Companies in the same or similar industries
may share common characteristics and are more likely to react comparably to
industry specific market or economic developments. Because the Portfolio
concentrates its investments in the energy industry, its securities are
subject to greater volatility compared to a fund that does not concentrate
its investments.


o    ENERGY INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that conduct business in the
energy industry or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from
energy-related activities in general are subject to changes in market
supply and demand for energy commodities and rates of change in the
technology for alternative energy resources which is generally higher than
that of other industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANY RISKS: The Energy Portfolio may invest in the
equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies. Small and
medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Energy Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Energy Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with
investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political
and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and
less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Energy Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common stock of

o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Energy Portfolio may write and sell options
on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct
investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect
correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying
asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE SMALL CAP PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Small Cap Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Small Cap Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Small Cap Portfolio's total assets will be
invested in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity
securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs,
of U.S. and foreign small capitalization companies that provide attractive
valuation opportunities. The Small Cap Portfolio may also write and sell options
on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment.


The Small Cap Portfolio's investment adviser believes that favorable investment
opportunities are available through companies that exhibit a number of the
following characteristics: have a market capitalization under $1 billion, have
little or no institutional ownership, have had short-term earnings shortfalls,
have had a recent IPO but have not attracted significant analyst coverage, are
selling at or below book or replacement value, and have price to earnings ratios
that are less than one half of their projected growth rate.


Small Cap Portfolio securities will be selected from companies that are engaged
in a number of industries if, in the investment adviser's opinion, the companies
meet the Small Cap Portfolio's investment criteria. Such companies include, but
are not limited to the following:


o    MEDIA: Companies that provide print, broadcast, cable, satellite and
web-based information and entertainment content.


o    FINANCIAL SERVICES: Companies that engage in financial service transactions
such as banking, credit cards, investment services, etc.


o    RETAILERS: Companies that sell retail products and services via traditional
stores, catalogues, telemarketing, and web-site means.


o    MANUFACTURING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS: Companies that manufacture and
distribute products to retail outlets.


The investment adviser considers a company's fundamentals by reviewing its
balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends. The investment
adviser also looks at the amount of capital a company spends on research and
development.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Small
Cap Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Small Cap Portfolio
may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity.
Some of these short-term money market instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Small Cap Portfolio engages in this temporary, defensive
strategy, the Small Cap Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Small Cap Portfolio are listed
below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of
the Small Cap Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Small Cap Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could
lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The portfolio securities selected by the investment
adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market
in general is rising and may fail to meet the Small Cap Portfolio's
investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    SMALL COMPANY RISKS: The Small Cap Portfolio may invest in the stocks of
small-sized companies. Small-sized companies often have narrower markets
and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more
established companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile
and they face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Small Cap Portfolio's assets.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Small Cap Portfolio may invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with
investing in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political
and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and
less stringent regulation of securities markets.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE MIDDLE EAST PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Middle East Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Middle East Portfolio's objective, under normal circumstances, at
least 65% of the Middle East Portfolio's total assets will be invested in common
stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity securities having the
characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs, of foreign and U.S.
companies that are engaged in business activities in the "Middle East". The
Middle East Portfolio may also write and sell options on securities in which it
invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment. The Middle East Portfolio
defines the "Middle East" to be that region ranging from Morocco on the North
African coast, including Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan and Chad, to the
Persian Gulf region, including Israel , Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, People's Republic of Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and Kuwait). Based on their gross domestic products and stock market
capitalizations, it is expected that Israel and Egypt will represent the largest
country investments in the Middle East Portfolio.


The Middle East Portfolio's investment adviser believes that the Middle East
offers significant investment opportunities. The Middle East region is
characterized by wide variations in wealth, physical resources, economic
development and demographics, among other fundamental measures. Some of these
nations, notably Israel, have attained world-class status in areas such as
technological innovation. This great divergence is encompassed in a relatively
small region and is coupled with varying degrees of progress in economic
development, privatization, and financial market deregulation.


The Middle East's positioning in the technology and bio-technology sectors and
the historical constraints on valuation due to geo-political turmoil have
created many attractive investment valuations. Historically, political risk has
been manifested in local financial markets in the form of significant valuation
discounts, particularly on an episodic short-term basis. Improved prospects for
political stability in the region and the anticipation of progress in peace
negotiations has historically resulted in significant appreciation in many of
these markets. The recent advent of the Internet has provided many technology
and bio-technology companies, with a strong track record for innovation, the
ability to communicate electronically, access and share information and conduct
business around the world.


Middle East Portfolio securities will be selected from foreign or U.S. companies
that are organized under the laws of Middle East nations or which, at the time
of investment are determined to hold a significant portion of their assets in or
derive a significant proportion of their gross revenues from Middle East
nations. These companies may be large, medium or small in size if, in the
investment adviser's opinion, the companies meet the Middle East Portfolio's
investment criteria. Accordingly, the Middle East Portfolio seeks to invest in
securities of companies whose research and development efforts may result in
higher stock values. Such companies include, but are not limited to the
following:


o    COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Companies that produce, manufacture and develop tools to
enhance the speed, integrity and storage of data, facilitate information
distribution and gathering, provide secure electronic transactions, and
operate other computer and telecommunications-based applications, for U.S.
and export markets.


o    COMPUTER HARDWARE:  Companies that develop and produce computer and network
hardware such as modems, switchers and routers, and those that develop and
manufacture workstations and personal communications systems, for U.S. and
export markets.


o    INTERNET: Companies that develop, produce and sell products and services
via and in support of the Internet, especially in local markets.


o    PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY: Companies that develop and market drug
and medical treatment products and technologies, especially for the export
marketplace.


o    LOCAL RETAIL FRANCHISE: Companies that benefit from regulatory, cultural or
physical characteristics specific to the region, such as non-alcoholic
brewers, air conditioning distributors and financial institutions.


o    GROWTH IN POPULATION/WEALTH: Companies that benefit from local demographic
trends in fields such as real estate, mortgage banking, telecommunications
and food manufacturers/distributors.


The investment adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company's
positioning and the business model as well as its ability to grow and expand its
business. The investment adviser also considers a company's fundamentals by
reviewing its balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends. The
investment adviser also looks at the amount of capital a company spends on
research and development. The investment adviser believes that dollars invested
in research and development today frequently have significant bearing on future
growth.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the
Middle East Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality U.S.
short-term debt securities and money market instruments. The Middle East
Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain
liquidity. Some of these short-term money market instruments include:


o    commercial paper

o    certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker's acceptance

o    U.S. government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)

o    repurchase agreements


To the extent that the Middle East Portfolio engages in this temporary,
defensive strategy, the Middle East Portfolio may not achieve its investment
objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Middle East Portfolio are listed
below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of
the Middle East Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Middle East Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS: The stocks selected by the investment adviser may
decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general
is rising and may fail to meet the Middle East Portfolio's investment
objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS: The investment adviser may not be able to sell portfolio
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to
industry-specific development. Companies in the same or similar industries
may share common characteristics and are more likely to react to
industry-specific market or economic developments.


o    TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that
conduct business on the technology and bio-technology fields are subject to
the rate of change in technology and scientific innovation, as well as
competition, which is generally higher than that of other industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANY RISKS: The Middle East Portfolio may invest
in the stocks of small, medium and large-sized companies. Small and
medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Middle East Portfolio's assets.


o    POLITICAL RISKS: The Middle East Portfolio will invest in securities of
foreign countries that have experienced historical periods of political
instability. These securities carry higher returns but involve more risks
than those associated with U.S. investments.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Middle East Portfolio will invest in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks include currency
fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial
reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    EMERGING MARKET RISKS: The Middle East Portfolio will invest in emerging as
well as developed markets in the Middle East. Countries in emerging markets
can have relatively unstable government economies based on only a few
industries, and securities markets that trade a small number of issues.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Middle East Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common stock
of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Middle East
Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a more
diversified mutual fund.


o    OPTION TRANSACTION RISKS: The Middle East Portfolio may write and sell
options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or
direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the
imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the
underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE ASIA TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO








INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Asia Technology Portfolio is long-term growth of
capital.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



To achieve the Asia Technology Portfolio's investment objective, under normal
circumstances, at least 65% of the Asia Technology Portfolio's total assets will
be invested in the equity securities of Asia companies that the portfolio
manager believes is engaged in technology related business activities. Such
companies may use technology extensively in the development of new or improved
products or processes or, alternatively, may benefit from the commercialization
of technological advances, although they may not be involved in research and
development. The Asia Technology Portfolio may also, from time to time, utilize
certain derivatives for hedging purposes and/or direct investment.


Under normal circumstances, the Asia Technology Portfolio will invest in at
least three different Asian countries. The Asia Technology Portfolio considers
Asian companies to include companies that are organized under the laws of any
country in the Asian region, including Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Japan,
Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, China, Cambodia, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, South
Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Myanmar. The sub-adviser also
considers companies to be Asian if the Asia Technology Portfolio's sub-adviser,
determines that they: (1) derive at least 50% of their revenues from goods
produced or sold, investments made or services performed in or with one or more
of the Asian countries; (2) maintain at least 50% of their assets in one or more
Asian countries; or (3) have securities which are traded principally on the
stock exchange in an Asian country.


The Asia Technology Portfolio is not restricted with respect to its allocation
of the Asia Technology Portfolio's assets among Asian countries. The sub-adviser
will determine such allocation in its discretion based on various factors such
as the prospects for economic growth, expected inflation levels, government
policies and the range of available investment opportunities.


The companies in which the Asia Technology Portfolio invests may be large,
medium or small in size if, in the adviser's opinion, the companies meet the
Asia Technology Portfolio's investment criteria. Furthermore, portfolio
securities will be selected from a wide variety of industries. Industries likely
to be represented in the investment portfolio include the Internet, computers
and computer peripherals, software, electronic components and systems,
communications equipment and services, semiconductors, media and information
services, pharmaceuticals, hospital supply and medical devices, biotechnology
products, environmental services, chemical products and synthetic materials and
defense and aerospace products and services.


Asia Technology Portfolio securities are selected based on a rigorous bottom-up
approach to identify undervalued stocks. The sub-adviser will emphasize
intensive research and stock picking as the basis of a disciplined and
systematic approach to identifying such under-priced securities. Fundamental
parameters that are value and/or growth oriented are used to screen the stock
universe to identify companies that are likely to outperform. In addition,
regular company visits are an intrinsic part of the screening process. Other
investment techniques such as top-down macro analysis and market valuation are
used by the sub-adviser to support asset allocation decisions among the various
Asian countries listed above. Quantitative tools are used by the sub-adviser to
help identify and manage the Asia Technology Portfolio's exposure to different
risk factors. The sub-adviser considers whether to sell a particular security
when any of these factors materially change.


The Asia Technology Portfolio may from time to time utilize certain
sophisticated investment techniques, including derivatives. Derivatives are
financial instruments which derive their value from the performance of an
underlying asset--another security, a commodity, or an index. Examples of these
include:


o    FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. When the Asia Technology Portfolio buys
a foreign security, it generally does so in a foreign currency. That
currency has a price, and that price fluctuates. In order to reduce the
risk of currency price swings or for other purposes, the Portfolio may buy
forward foreign exchange contracts on foreign currencies. These contracts
"lock in" a price for the currency at a certain future date. The Asia
Technology Portfolio may also use put and call options on foreign
currencies.


o    OPTIONS AND WARRANTS. An option is a contract giving the owner the right to
buy ("call option") or sell ("put option") a security at a designated price
("strike price") on a certain date. A warrant is the equivalent of a call
option written by the issuer of the underlying security.


o    FUTURES CONTRACTS. Futures contracts obligate one party to deliver and the
other party to purchase a specific quantity of a commodity or a financial
instrument at a designated future date, time and place. Stock index futures
contracts call for a cash payment based on the increase or decrease in the
value of an index. The Asia Technology Portfolio may enter into foreign
currency forward contracts, repurchase agreements, ARINs, and certain other
types of futures, options and derivatives with banks, brokerage firms and
other investors in over-the-counter markets, not through any exchange.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS



To respond to adverse market, economic, political or other conditions, the Asia
Technology Portfolio may invest up to 100% of its assets in high quality, debt
and money market instruments issued or guaranteed by U.S. or Asian issuers or
governments, their agencies or instrumentalities. The Asia Technology Portfolio
may invest up to 35% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity. To
the extent that the Asia Technology Portfolio engages in this temporary,
defensive strategy, the Asia Technology Portfolio may not achieve its investment
objective.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose
money. The principal risks of investing in the Asia Technology Portfolio are
listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and
value of the Asia Technology Portfolio and your investment.


o    STOCK MARKET RISKS: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks
and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in
value, the Asia Technology Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you
could lose money on your investment.


o    STOCK SELECTION RISKS:The stocks selected by the sub-adviser may decline in
value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising
and may fail to meet the Asia Technology Portfolio's investment objective.


o    LIQUIDITY RISKS:  The sub-adviser may not be able to sell investment
securities at an optimal time or price.


o    INDUSTRY RISKS: Mutual funds that invest in a particular industry carry a
risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to
industry-specific development. Companies in the same or similar industries
may share common characteristics and are more likely to react to
industry-specific market or economic developments.


o    TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS: Companies that conduct business in the
technology industries are subject to government regulation and the rate of
change in technology and scientific innovation, as well as competition,
which is generally higher than that of other industries.


o    SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANY RISKS: The Asia Technology Portfolio may
invest in the stocks of small, medium and large-sized companies. Small and
medium-sized companies often have narrower markets and more limited
managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established
companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they
face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the
volatility of the Asia Technology Portfolio's assets.


o    POLITICAL RISKS: The Asia Technology Portfolio invests in securities of
foreign countries that have experienced historical periods of political
instability. These securities carry higher returns but involve more risks
than those associated with U.S. investments.


o    FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS: The Asia Technology Portfolio invests in foreign
securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than
those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks include currency
fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial
reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.


o    EMERGING MARKETS RISKS: The Asia Technology Portfolio invests in emerging
as well as developed markets in Asia. Countries in emerging markets can
have relatively unstable government economies based on only a few
industries, and securities markets that trade a small number of issues.


o    NON-DIVERSIFICATION RISKS: As a non-diversified investment company, more of
the Asia Technology Portfolio's assets may be concentrated in the common
stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Asia Technology
Portfolio's shares more susceptible to certain risks than are shares of a
more diversified mutual fund.


o    DERIVATIVES RISKS: The Asia Technology Portfolio may utilize derivatives
for hedging purposes and/or direct investment. Derivatives contain certain
special risks including the imperfect correlation between the value of the
derivative instrument and the value of the underlying asset.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, STRATEGIES AND RISKS OF THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO







INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The investment objective of the Government Money Market Portfolio is to provide
current income consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of
liquidity.






INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



The Government Money Market Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective
by investing all of its investable assets in high quality, U.S.
dollar-denominated short-term obligations that have been determined by the
investment adviser, subject to the approval of the Government Money Market
Portfolio's Board of Trustees, to present minimal credit risk. The Government
Money Market Portfolio invests exclusively in obligations issued or guaranteed
by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase
agreements that are fully collateralized by such obligations ("U.S. Government
Securities"). U.S. Government Securities include direct obligations of the U.S.
Treasury, such as Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds. The
Government Money Market Portfolio seeks to maintain a constant $1.00 net asset
value per share.


U.S. Government Securities are high quality instruments guaranteed as to
principal and interest and issued by the U.S. Treasury or by an agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. Government. Not all U.S. Government Securities are
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States however. Some are
backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; others are
backed by the discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase the
agencies' obligations; while others are supported only by the credit of the
instrumentality. In the case of securities not backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States, the Government Money Market Portfolio must look
principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate
repayment.


Yields on short-, intermediate- and long-term U.S. Government Securities are
dependent on a variety of factors, including the general conditions of the money
and bond markets, the size of a particular offering and the maturity of the
obligation. Debt securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher
capital appreciation and depreciation than do obligations with shorter
maturities and lower yields. The market value of U.S. Government Securities
generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates. An increase in
interest rates, therefore, generally would reduce the market value of the
Government Money Market Portfolio's investments in U.S. Government Securities,
while a decline in interest rates generally would increase the market value of
the Government Money Market Portfolio's investments in these securities.


Under a repurchase agreement, the Government Money Market Portfolio purchases a
U.S. Government Security and simultaneously agrees to sell the security back to
the seller at a mutually agreed-upon future price and date, normally one day or
a few days later. The resale price is greater than the purchase price,
reflecting an agreed-upon market interest rate premium during the Government
Money Market Portfolio's holding period. While the maturities of the underlying
securities in repurchase agreement transactions may be more than one year, the
term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year. The
Government Money Market Portfolio may enter into repurchase agreements with
banks that are members of Federal Reserve System or securities dealers who are
members of a national securities exchange or are primary dealers in U.S.
Government Securities. The investment adviser monitors the creditworthiness of
each firm that is a party to a repurchase agreement with the Government Money
Market Portfolio.






PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTMENT



The principal risks of investing in the Government Money Market Portfolio are
listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and
value of the Government Money Market Portfolio and your investment.


o    INTEREST RATE RISKS: The rate of income will vary from day to day depending
on short-term interest rates. It is possible that a major change in
interest rates could cause the value of your investment to decline. The
values of the obligations held by the Portfolio can be expected to vary
inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates. Although the
investment policies of the Fund and Portfolio are designed to minimize
these changes and to maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share, there
is no assurance that these policies will be successful.


o    CREDIT RISKS: Changes in the credit quality rating or changes in an
issuer's financial condition can also affect the Portfolio. A default on a
security held, or a repurchase agreement entered into, by the Portfolio
could cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline.


o    REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RISKS: One of the risks of investing in repurchase
agreements is that the seller may not repurchase the securities from the
Portfolio, which may result in the Portfolio selling the security for less
than the price agreed upon with the seller. Another risk of repurchase
agreements is that the seller may default or file for bankruptcy under
which circumstances the Portfolio might have to wait through lengthy court
actions before selling the securities. In the event of a default or
bankruptcy by the seller, the Portfolio will liquidate those securities
held under the repurchase agreement, which securities constitute collateral
for the seller's obligation to repurchase the securities.






MAIN RISKS OF THE PORTFOLIOS





The principal risks of investing in each Portfolio are described previously in
this Prospectus. The following list provides more detail about some of those
risks, along with information on additional types of risks which may apply to
the Portfolios.



INVESTING IN MUTUAL FUNDS--ALL PORTFOLIOS



All mutual funds carry risks that may cause you to lose money on your investment
in one or more of the Portfolios. The following describes the primary risks to
each Portfolio based on each Portfolio's specific investment objective and
strategies. As all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks
and fluctuations in value due to earnings, economic and political conditions and
other factors, the Portfolios can give no assurance that its investment
objective will be achieved.



MARKET RISK--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO



The net asset value of each Portfolio will fluctuate based on changes in the
value of its underlying portfolio. The stock market is generally susceptible to
volatile fluctuations in market price. Market prices of securities in which each
Portfolio invests may be adversely affected by an issuer's having experienced
losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuer's failure to meet the
market's expectations with respect to new products or services, or even by
factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer. The value of
the securities held by the Portfolios is also subject to the risk that a
specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall
market. Under any of these circumstances, the value of each Portfolio's shares
and total return will fluctuate, and your investment in the corresponding
Portfolio may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your
shares.


INTERNET INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISKS--THE INTERNET PORTFOLIO, THE INFRASTRUCTURE
PORTFOLIO, THE EMERGING GROWTH PORTFOLIO, THE GLOBAL GROWTH PORTFOLIO, AND THE
NEW PARADIGM PORTFOLIO The value of each Portfolio's shares will be susceptible
to factors affecting the Internet, such as heightened regulatory scrutiny and
impending changes in government policies which may have a material effect on the
products and services of this industry. Furthermore, securities of companies in
this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies in other
industries. Competitive pressures and changing demand may have a significant
effect on the financial condition of Internet companies. These companies spend
heavily on research and development and are especially sensitive to the risk of
product obsolescence. The occurrence of any of these factors, individually or
collectively, may adversely affect the value of a Portfolio's shares and your
investment in the corresponding Fund.



MEDICAL RESEARCH INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS--THE MEDICAL PORTFOLIO



Medical and pharmaceutical-related companies in general are subject to the rate
of change in technology, which is generally higher than that of other
industries. Similarly, cancer research-related industries use many products and
services of companies engaged in medical and pharmaceutical-related activities
and are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by
progressive scientific and technological advances. Medical research and
development is also subject to strict regulatory scrutiny and ongoing
legislative action.



ENERGY INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS--THE ENERGY PORTFOLIO



The value of the Energy Portfolio's shares will be susceptible to factors
affecting the energy industry, such as volatile market supply and demand
conditions and changes in domestic government policies which may have a material
effect on the products and services of this industry. Furthermore, securities of
companies in this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies
in other industries. Competitive pressures and changing demand may have a
significant effect on the financial condition of energy-related companies.
Alternative energy-related companies spend heavily on research and development
and are especially sensitive to the risk of product obsolescence. The occurrence
of any of these factors, individually or collectively, may adversely affect the
value of the Energy Portfolio's shares and your investment in the Portfolio.


OTHER SECURITIES A PORTFOLIO MIGHT PURCHASE--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE
GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO Under normal market conditions, each Portfolio
invests at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities, consisting of
common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and securities having the
characteristics of common stocks. If the investment adviser believes that market
conditions warrant a temporary defensive posture, a Portfolio may invest without
limitation in high quality, short-term debt securities and money market
instruments. These short-term debt securities and money market instruments
include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and
U.S. Government securities and repurchase agreements. (For the Asia Technology
Portfolio, short-term debt securities and money market instruments may be issued
by Asian governments, their agencies or instrumentalities.)



SECURITIES LENDING--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO



Each Portfolio may lend its portfolio securities to broker-dealers by entering
directly into lending arrangements with such broker-dealers or indirectly
through repurchase agreements, amounting to no more than 33 1/3% of its assets.
Repurchase transactions will be fully collateralized at all times with cash
and/or short-term debt obligations. These transactions involve some risk to a
Portfolio if the other party should default on its obligation and the Portfolio
is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral. In the event that the
original seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase, a Portfolio will seek
to sell the collateral, which could involve costs or delays. To the extent
proceeds from the sale of collateral are less than the repurchase price, each
Portfolio forced to sell such collateral in this manner would suffer a loss.



NON-DIVERSIFICATION--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO



Each Portfolio is classified as "non-diversified" under federal securities laws
which means that one-half of each Portfolio's assets may be invested in two or
more stocks while the other half is spread out among various investments not
exceeding 5% of a Portfolio's total assets. As a result of their non-diversified
status, a Portfolio's shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the
value of the securities of a particular company than would be the shares of a
diversified investment company.


INVESTMENT IN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANIES--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE
GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO Each Portfolio may invest in small or
medium-size companies. Accordingly, a Portfolio may be subject to the additional
risks associated with investment in companies with small or medium-size capital
structures (generally a market capitalization of $5 billion or less). The market
prices of the securities of such companies tend to be more volatile than those
of larger companies. Further, these securities tend to trade at a lower volume
than those of larger, more established companies. If a Portfolio is heavily
invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly decline,
the net asset value of that Portfolio and your investment in the corresponding
Fund will be more susceptible to significant losses.



FOREIGN SECURITIES--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO



Investing in foreign securities can carry higher returns than those generally
associated with U.S. investments. However, foreign securities may be
substantially riskier than U.S. investments. The economies of foreign countries
may differ from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic
product, rate of inflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment,
resource self-sufficiency, and balance of payments position. Furthermore, the
economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent on
international trade and, accordingly, have been, and may continue to be,
adversely affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in
relative currency values and other protective measures imposed or negotiated by
the countries with which they trade. These economies also have been, and may
continue to be, adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with
which they trade. A Portfolio may be required to obtain prior governmental
approval for foreign investments in some countries under certain circumstances.
Governments may require approval to invest in certain issuers or industries
deemed sensitive to national interests, and the extent of foreign investment in
certain debt securities and U.S. companies may be subject to limitation.
Individual companies may also limit foreign ownership to prevent, among other
things, violation of foreign investment limitations.


Some foreign investments may risk being subject to repatriation controls that
could render such securities illiquid. Other countries might undergo
nationalization, expropriation, political changes, governmental regulation,
social instability or diplomatic developments (including war) that could
adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the investments
in those countries. For this reason, Portfolios that invest primarily in the
securities of a single country will be greatly impacted by any political,
economic or regulatory developments affecting the value of the securities.
Additional risks include currency fluctuations, political and economic
instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent
regulation of securities markets.



EMERGING MARKET RISKS--THE MIDDLE EAST PORTFOLIO AND THE ASIA TECHNOLOGY
PORTFOLIO



Securities issued or traded in emerging markets generally entail greater risks
than securities issued or traded in developed markets. For example, their prices
can be significantly more volatile than prices in developed countries. Emerging
market economies may also experience more severe downturns (with corresponding
currency devaluations) than developed economies. Emerging market countries may
have relatively unstable governments and may present the risk of nationalization
of businesses, expropriation, confiscatory taxation or, in certain instances,
reversion to closed market, centrally planned economies.


Because the Middle East Portfolio and the Asia Technology Portfolio invest in
emerging markets regions, these Portfolio returns will be significantly more
volatile and may differ substantially from the overall U.S. market generally.
Your investment in either of these Portfolios has the risk that market changes
or other factors affecting Asian and/or Middle Eastern region countries,
including political instability and unpredictable economic conditions, may have
a more significant effect on these Portfolios' net asset values than would be
the case for a mutual fund invested in U.S. securities.



REGIONAL RISKS--THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE ASIA TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO



Certain risks associated with international investments and investing in
smaller, developing capital markets are heightened for investments in Asian
and/or Middle Eastern region countries. For example, some of the currencies of
Asian countries have experienced steady devaluations relative to the U.S.
dollar, and major adjustments have been made in certain of these currencies
periodically. Although there is a trend toward less government involvement in
commerce, governments of many Asian countries have exercised and continue to
exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In
certain cases, the government still owns or controls many companies, including
some of the largest in the country. The same may be true of Middle Eastern
region countries. Accordingly, government actions in the future could have a
significant effect on economic conditions in Asian and Middle Eastern region
countries, which could affect private sector companies and the Portfolios, as
well as the value of the Portfolios' investment securities.



PORTFOLIO BORROWING--ALL PORTFOLIOS



Each Portfolio may leverage up to 5% of its assets to Portfolio investment
activities or to achieve higher returns. Each Portfolio may borrow money from
banks for temporary or emergency purposes in order to meet redemption requests.
To reduce its indebtedness, a Portfolio may have to sell a portion of its
investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition,
interest paid by a Portfolio on borrowed funds would decrease the net earnings
of both that Portfolio and your investment in the Portfolio.



DERIVATIVES RISK--ALL PORTFOLIOS OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET
PORTFOLIO



Each Portfolio may invest in derivatives such as options and futures. The
successful use of the investment practices described above depends on the
portfolio manager's ability to forecast stock price movements and/or currency
exchange rate movements correctly. Should stock prices or exchange rates move
unexpectedly, a Portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
transactions, or may realize losses, and thus be in a worse position than if
such strategies had not been used. Unlike many exchange-traded futures contracts
and options on futures contracts, there are no daily price fluctuation limits
for certain options and forward contracts, and adverse market movements could
therefore continue to an unlimited extent over a period of time. In addition,
the correlation between movements in the prices of futures contracts, options
and forward contracts and movements in the prices of the securities and
currencies hedged or used for cover will not be perfect and could produce
unanticipated losses.


A Portfolio's ability to dispose of its positions in futures contracts, options,
and forward contracts depends on the availability of liquid markets in such
instruments. Markets in options and futures with respect to a number of types of
securities and currencies are relatively new and still developing, and there is
no public market for forward contracts. It is impossible to predict the amount
of trading interest that may exist in various types of futures contracts,
options, and forward contracts. If a secondary market does not exist for an
option purchased or written by a Portfolio, it might not be possible to effect a
closing transaction in the option (i.e., dispose of the option), with the result
that (1) an option purchased by a Portfolio would have to be exercised in order
for the Portfolio to realize any profit and (2) a Portfolio may not be able to
sell currencies or portfolio securities covering an option written by the
Portfolio until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security,
futures contract or currency upon exercise. Therefore, no assurance can be given
that the Portfolios will be able to utilize these instruments effectively. In
addition, a Portfolio's ability to engage in options and futures transactions
may be limited by tax considerations and the use of certain hedging techniques
may adversely impact the characterization of income to the Portfolio for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

VALUATION OF PORTFOLIO SHARES





Shares of each Portfolio are sold at its net asset value per share ("NAV"),
which is determined by each Portfolio as of the close of regular trading
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), on each day that the New York Stock Exchange
(the "Exchange") is open for unrestricted business. In the case of the
Government Money Market Portfolio, the NAV is determined as of 12:00 p.m.
Eastern time. Purchase and redemption requests are priced at the next NAV
calculated after receipt and acceptance of a completed purchase or redemption
request. The NAV is determined by dividing the value of a Portfolio's
securities, cash and other assets, minus all expenses and liabilities, by the
number of shares outstanding (assets-liabilities/ # of shares = NAV). The NAV
takes into account the expenses and fees of each Portfolio, including
management, administration and shareholder servicing fees, which are accrued
daily.


Each Portfolio's securities (other than the Government Money Market Portfolio)
are valued each day at the last quoted sales price on the securities principal
exchange. If market quotations are not readily available, securities will be
valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith in accordance with
procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Each Portfolio other than the
Government Money Market Portfolio may use independent pricing services to assist
in calculating the NAV of such Portfolio's shares.


The Government Money Market Portfolio will utilize the amortized cost method in
valuing its portfolio securities. This method involves valuing a security at its
cost adjusted by a constant amortization of maturity of any discount or premium,
regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of
the instrument. The purpose of this method of calculation is to facilitate the
maintenance of a consistent net asset value per share for the Government Money
Market Portfolio of $1.00. However, there is no assurance that the $1.00 net
asset value per share will be maintained.



TRADING IN FOREIGN SECURITIES



Trading in foreign securities may be completed at times when the Exchange is
closed. In computing the NAV of each Portfolio that trades foreign securities,
the investment adviser values foreign securities at the latest closing price on
the exchange on which they are traded immediately prior to the closing of the
Exchange. Certain foreign currency exchange rates may also be determined at the
latest rate prior to the closing of the Exchange. Prices of foreign securities
quoted in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current rates.
Occasionally, events that affect these values and exchange rates may occur
between the times at which they are determined and the closing of the Exchange.
If such events materially affect the value of portfolio securities, these
securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the
Board of Trustees.



PURCHASE OF SHARES





Shares of beneficial interest in each Portfolio are sold without a sales load,
at the NAV next determined after an order is received by a Portfolio. Shares in
a Portfolio are sold solely in private placement transactions that do not
involve any "public offering" within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933
Act. Investments in the Portfolio may be made only by regulated investment
companies, unregulated foreign investment companies, U.S. and non-U.S.
institutional investors, S corporations, segregated asset accounts, insurance
company separate accounts, and certain qualified pension and retirement plans.
This Registration Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, any "security" within the meaning of the 1933
Act.


There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in the Portfolio. The
Portfolio reserves the right to cease accepting investments at any time or to
reject any investment order.



REDEMPTION OF SHARES





An investor in a Portfolio may redeem all or any portion of its investment at
the NAV next determined after a redemption request in good order is received by
such Portfolio. The proceeds of a redemption will be paid by the Portfolio in
federal funds normally on the Business Day that the redemption is effected, but
in any event within three business days, except as extensions may be permitted
by law.


Each Portfolio reserves the right to pay redemptions in kind. Unless requested
by an investor or deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interests of the
investors in a Portfolio as a group, the Portfolio will not pay a redemption in
kind to an investor, except in situations where that investor may pay
redemptions in kind.


The right of any investor to receive payment with respect to any redemption may
be suspended, or the payment of the redemption proceeds postponed, during any
period in which the NYSE is closed or trading on the NYSE is restricted or to
the extent otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act.



EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE





You can exchange your shares in a Portfolio for shares of any other Portfolio
offered by Kinetics Portfolios Trust at no charge. You should carefully read the
prospectus of a portfolio before exchanging shares into that portfolio. Be
advised that exercising the exchange privilege consists of two transactions: a
sale of shares in one portfolio and the purchase of shares in another. Further,
exchanges may have certain tax consequences and you could realize short- or
long-term capital gains or losses. Exchanges are generally made only between
identically registered accounts unless you send written instructions with a
signature guarantee requesting otherwise. You should request your exchange prior
to market close to obtain that day's closing NAV. Exchange requests received
after the close of the Exchange will be treated as though received on the next
business day.


Call (800) 930-3828 to learn more about the other Kinetics Portfolios and about
exercising your exchange privilege.






DISTRIBUTION AND TAXES






DISTRIBUTIONS



Distributions (whether treated for tax purposes as ordinary income or long-term
capital gains) to shareholders of each Portfolio are generally paid in
additional shares of the Portfolio in which shareholders are already invested,
with no sales charge, based on the Portfolio's NAV as of the close of business
on the record date for such distributions. However, you may elect on the
application form to receive distributions as follows:


OPTION 1: To receive income dividends and capital gain distributions in
additional Portfolio shares, or


OPTION 2: To receive all income dividends and capital gain distributions in
cash.


Each Portfolio intends to pay any dividends from investment company taxable
income and distributions representing capital gain at least annually, usually in
December. Each Portfolio will advise each shareholder annually of the amounts of
dividends from investment company taxable income and of net capital gain
distributions reinvested or paid in cash to the shareholder during the calendar
year.


If you select Option 1 or Option 2 and the U.S. Postal Service cannot deliver
your distribution checks, or if your distribution checks remain uncashed for six
months, your distribution checks will be reinvested in your account at the then
current NAV of the appropriate Portfolio and your election will be converted to
the purchase of additional shares.



TAXES



None of the Portfolios is required to pay federal income taxes on its ordinary
income and capital gain because each Portfolio is treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes. All interest, dividends and gains and losses of a
Portfolio are deemed to "pass through" to its shareholders, regardless of
whether such interest, dividends or gains are distributed by the Portfolio or
the Portfolio realizes losses. Under each Portfolio's operational method, it is
not subject to any federal income tax. However, each shareholder in a Portfolio
will be taxed on its proportionate share (as determined in accordance with the
Trust's Declaration of Trust and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended) of the
Portfolio's ordinary income and capital gain, to the extent that the shareholder
is subject to tax on its income. The Trust will inform shareholders of each
Portfolio of the amount and nature of such income or gain.


The foregoing discussion relates only to federal income tax law. Income from a
Portfolio also may be subject to foreign, state and local taxes, and the
treatment under foreign, state and local income tax laws may differ from the
federal income tax treatment. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors
with respect to particular questions of federal, foreign, state and local
taxation.



DISTRIBUTION OF SHARES

Kinetics Funds Distributor, Inc. ("KFDI"), serves as the private placement agent
for the shares of the Portfolio on a best efforts basis. KFDI is a registered

the Portfolio by Firstar.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT KINETICS PORTFOLIO TRUST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kinetics Portfolios Trust (the "Trust") is a business trust organized pursuant
to a Declaration of Trust under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 14,
2000. The Portfolio's principal business office is located at 1311 Mamaroneck








Avenue, White Plains, New York 10605. Kinetics Portfolios Trust (the "Trust") is
a Delaware business trust, established on March 14, 2000. The Trust is comprised
of several series of mutual funds, all of which are non-diversified, open-end
management investment companies.



CAPITALIZATION



The authorized capitalization of Kinetics Portfolio Trust consists of an
unlimited number of beneficial interests with no par value. Each share has equal
dividend, distribution and liquidation rights. There are no conversion or
preemptive rights applicable to any shares of the Portfolio. All shares issued
are fully paid and non-assessable. Each holder of beneficial interests has one
vote for each share held. Each investor in a Portfolio is entitled to
participate equally in the Portfolio's earnings and assets and to vote in
proportion to the amount of its investment in the Portfolio. Voting rights are
non-cumulative.


Each Portfolio investor is entitled to a vote in proportion to the amount
of its investment therein. Portfolio investors will vote together in certain
circumstances (e.g., election of the Trustees and ratification of auditors, as
required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder). One or more Portfolios
could control the outcome of these votes. Investors do not have cumulative
voting rights, and investors holding more than 50% of the aggregate beneficial
interests in the Trust or in a Portfolio, as the case may be, may control the
outcome of votes. The Trust is not required and has no current intention to hold
annual meetings of investors, but the Trust will hold special meetings of
investors when (1) a majority of the Trustees determines to do so or (2)
investors holding at least 10% of the interests in a Portfolio (if the meeting
relates solely to that Portfolio), or investors holding at least 10% of the
aggregate interests in the Trust (if the meeting relates to the Trust and
not specifically to a Portfolio) requests in writing a meeting of investors.
Changes in fundamental policies or limitations will be submitted to investors
for approval.


The Trust is organized as a business trust under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Investors in a Portfolio will be held personally liable for its
obligations and liabilities, subject, however, to indemnification by the Trust
in the event that there is imposed upon an investor a greater portion of the
liabilities and obligations than its proportionate beneficial interest in the
Portfolio. The Declaration of Trust also provides that, subject to the
provisions of the 1940 Act, the Trust may maintain insurance (for example,
fidelity bonding and errors and omissions insurance) for the protection of the
Portfolio, investors, Trustees, officers, employees, and agents covering
possible tort and other liabilities. Thus, the risk of an investor incurring
financial loss on account of such liability would be limited to circumstances in
which the Portfolio had inadequate insurance and was unable to meet its
obligation out of its assets.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ASSOCIATED RISKS





The following paragraphs provide a more detailed description of the Portfolios'
investment policies and risks identified in the Prospectus. Unless otherwise
noted, the policies described in this SAI pertain to all of the Portfolios other
than the KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO. Furthermore, unless
otherwise noted, the policies described in this SAI are not fundamental and may
be changed by the Board of Trustees of the Trust without shareholder approval.



COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK



Common stocks are units of ownership of a corporation. Preferred stocks are
stocks that often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over
common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets. Some preferred
stocks may be convertible into common stock. Convertible securities are
securities that may be converted into or exchanged for a specified amount of
common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time
at a specified price or formula.



CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES



The Portfolios may invest in debt securities convertible into common stocks.
Debt purchased by the Portfolios will consist of obligations of medium-grade or
higher, having at least adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
Non-convertible debt obligations will be rated BBB or higher by S&P, or Baa or
higher by Moody's. Convertible debt obligations will be rated B or higher by S&P
or B or higher by Moody's. Securities rated Baa by Moody's are considered by
Moody's to be medium-grade securities and have adequate capacity to pay
principal and interest. Bonds in the lowest investment grade category (BBB) have
speculative characteristics, with changes in the economy or other circumstances
more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the bonds to make principal and
interest payments than would occur with bonds rated in higher categories.
Securities rated B are referred to as "high-risk" securities, generally lack
characteristics of a desirable investment, and are deemed speculative with
respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal over a long
period of time. See "Appendix" to this Statement of Additional Information for a
description of debt security ratings.



WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS



The Portfolios may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or
forward commitment basis. These transactions generally involve the purchase of a
security with payment and delivery due at some time in the future. A Portfolio
does not earn interest on such securities until settlement and bears the risk of
market value fluctuations in between the purchase and settlement dates. If the
seller fails to complete the sale, a Portfolio may lose the opportunity to
obtain a favorable price and yield. While the Portfolios will generally engage
in such when-issued, delayed-delivery and forward commitment transactions with
the intent of actually acquiring the securities, a Portfolio may sometimes sell
such a security prior to the settlement date.


The Portfolios may also sell securities on a delayed-delivery or forward
commitment basis. If Portfolios do so, they will not participate in future
gains or losses on the security. If the other party to such a transaction fails
to pay for the securities, the Portfolio could suffer a loss.



RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES



Each Portfolio may invest in a limited amount of restricted securities.
Restricted securities are securities that are thinly traded or whose resale is
restricted by federal securities laws. Restricted securities are any securities
in which the Portfolios may invest pursuant to their investment objective and
policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal
securities laws.



FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES



The fixed-income securities in which the Portfolios may invest are generally
subject to two kinds of risk: credit risk and market risk.


CREDIT RISK relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal
payments, as they come due. The ratings given a security by Moody's and S&P
provide a generally useful guide as to such credit risk. The lower the rating
given a security by such rating service, the greater the credit risk such rating
service perceives to exist with respect to such security. Increasing the amount
of Portfolio assets invested in unrated or lower-grade securities, while
intended to increase the yield produced by those assets, will also increase the
credit risk to which those assets are subject.


MARKET RISK relates to the fact that the market values of securities in which
the Portfolios may invest generally will be affected by changes in the level of
interest rates. An increase in interest rates will tend to reduce the market
values of such securities, whereas a decline in interest rates will tend to
increase their values. Medium- and lower-rated securities (Baa or BBB and lower)
and non-rated securities of comparable quality tend to be subject to wilder
fluctuations in yields and market values than higher-rated securities.
Medium-rated securities (those rated Baa or BBB) have speculative
characteristics while lower-rated securities are predominantly speculative. The
Portfolios are not required to dispose of debt securities whose ratings are
downgraded below these ratings subsequent to the Portfolios' purchase of the
securities. Relying in part on ratings assigned by credit agencies in making
investments will not protect the Portfolios from the risk that the fixed-income
securities in which the Portfolios invest will decline in value. Credit ratings
represent evaluations of the safety of principal, dividend and interest payments
on preferred stocks and debt securities, not the market values of such
securities, and such ratings may not be changed on a timely basis to reflect
subsequent events.


At no time will the Portfolios have more than 5% of their respective total
assets invested in any fixed-income securities that are unrated or rated below
investment grade either at the time of purchase or as a result of a reduction in
rating after purchase.


DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS. The Portfolios may invest in American Depositary Receipts
("ADRs") or other forms of depositary receipts, such as International Depositary
Receipts ("IDRs"). Depositary receipts are typically issued in connection with a
U.S. or foreign bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying
securities issued by a foreign corporation. Investments in these types of
securities involve certain inherent risks generally associated with investments
in foreign securities, including the following:


POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. Individual foreign economies of certain
countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States economy in
such respects as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital
reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, diversification and balance of payments
position. The internal politics of certain foreign countries may not be as
stable as those of the United States. Governments in certain foreign countries
also continue to participate to a significant degree, through ownership interest
or regulation, in their respective economies. Action by these governments could
include restrictions on foreign investment, nationalization, expropriation of
goods or imposition of taxes, and could have a significant effect on market
prices of securities and payment of interest. The economies of many foreign
countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly
affected by the trade policies and economic conditions of their trading
partners. Enactment by these trading partners of protectionist trade legislation
could have a significant adverse effect upon the securities markets of such
countries.


CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  A change in the value of any foreign currency
against the U.S. dollar will result in a corresponding change in the U.S. dollar
value of an ADR's underlying portfolio securities denominated in that currency.
Such changes will affect the Portfolio to the extent that the Portfolio is
invested in ADRs comprised of foreign securities.


TAXES. The interest and dividends payable on certain foreign securities
comprising an ADR may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, thus reducing the
net amount of income to be paid to the Portfolios and that may ultimately be
available for distribution to the Portfolio's shareholders.



DERIVATIVES



BUYING CALL AND PUT OPTIONS. The Portfolios may purchase call options. Such
transaction may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial
increase in the market price of the security that each Portfolio intends to
purchase. Prior to its expiration, a call option may be sold in a closing sale
transaction. Any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount
received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the
related transaction cost.


The Portfolios may purchase put options. By buying a put, each Portfolio has the
right to sell the security at the exercise price, thus limiting its risk of risk
of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put
expires. The amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security
will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option
and any related transaction cost. Prior to its expiration, a put option may be
sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will
depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for
the put option plus the related transaction costs.


WRITING (SELLING) CALL AND PUT OPTIONS. The Portfolios may write covered options
on equity and debt securities and indices. This means that, in the case of call
options, so long as each Portfolio is obligated as the writer of a call option,
it will own the underlying security subject to the option and, in the case of
put options, it will, through its custodian, deposit and maintain either cash or
securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of
the option.


Covered call options written by the Portfolios give the holder the right to buy
the underlying securities from the Portfolios as a stated exercise price. A call
option written by the Portfolios is "covered" if the Portfolios own the
underlying security that is subject to the call or has an absolute and immediate
right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or for
additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian
bank) upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio. A
call option is also covered if the Portfolios hold a call on the same security
and in the same principal amount as the call written where the exercise price of
the call held (a) is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call
written or (b) is greater than the exercise price of the call written if the
difference is maintained by the Portfolios in cash and high grade debt
securities in a segregated account with its custodian bank. The Portfolios may
purchase securities, which may be covered with call options solely on the basis
of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the
Portfolios. The Portfolios' turnover may increase through the exercise of a call
option; this will generally occur if the market value of a "covered" security
increases and the Fund has not entered in to a closing purchase transaction.


As a writer of an option, each Portfolio receives a premium less a commission,
and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the
market value of the security exceeding the call option price. The premium serves
to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security.
The premium paid by the buyer of an option will reflect, among other things, the
relationship of the exercise price to the market price, the volatility of the
underlying security, the remaining term of the option, the existing supply and
demand, and the interest rates.


The writer of a call option may have no control over when the underlying
securities must be sold because the writer may be assigned an exercise notice at
any time prior to the termination of the obligation. Exercise of a call option
by the purchaser will cause each Portfolio to forego future appreciation of the
securities covered by the option. Whether or not an option expires unexercised,
the writer retains the amount of the premium. This amount may, in the case of a
covered call option, be offset by a decline in the market value of the
underlying security during the option period. If a call option is exercised, the
writer experiences a profit or loss from the sale of the underlying security.
Thus during the option period, the writer of a call option gives up the
opportunity for appreciation in the market value of the underlying security or
currency above the exercise price. It retains the risk of the loss should the
price of the underlying security or foreign currency decline. Writing call
options also involves risks relating to each Portfolio's ability to close out
the option it has written.


Each Portfolio may write exchange-traded call options on its securities. Call
options may be written on portfolio securities indices, or foreign currencies.
With respect to securities and foreign currencies, the Portfolio may write call
and put options on an exchange or over-the-counter. Call options on portfolio
securities will be covered since the Portfolio will own the underlying
securities. Call option on securities indices will be written only to hedge in
an economically appropriate way portfolio securities that are not otherwise
hedged with options or financial futures contracts and will be "covered" by
identifying the specific portfolio securities being hedged. Options on foreign
currencies will be covered by securities denominated in that currency. Options
on securities indices will be covered by securities that substantially
replicated the movement of the index.


A put option on a security, security index, or foreign currency gives the
purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid to the writer (seller),
the right to sell the underlying security, index, or foreign currency at the
exercise price at any time during the option period. When each Portfolio writes
a secured put option, in will gain a profit in the amount of the premium, less a
commission, so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the
exercise price. However, each Portfolio remains obligated to purchase the
underlying security from the buyer of the put option (usually in the event the
price of the security falls bellows the exercise price) at any time during the
option period. If the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise
price, the Portfolios may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between
the exercise price and the sale price of the security, less the premium
received. Upon exercise by the purchaser, the writer of a put option has the
obligation to purchase the underlying security or foreign currency at the
exercise price. A put option on a securities index is similar to a put option on
an individual security, except that the value of the option depends on the
weighted value of the group of securities comprising the index and all
settlements are made in cash.


During the option period, the writer of a put option has assumed the risk that
the price of the underlying security or foreign currency will decline below the
exercise price. However, the writer of the put option has retained the
opportunity for an appreciated above the exercise price should the market price
of the underlying security or foreign currency increase. Writing put options
also involves risks relating to the Portfolios' ability to close out the option
that it has written.


The writer of an option who wishes to terminate his or her obligation may effect
a "closing purchase transaction" by buying an option of the same series as the
option previously written. The effect of the purchase is that the clearing
corporation will cancel the writer's position. However, a writer may not effect
a closing purchase transaction after being notified of the exercise of an
option. There is also no guarantee that the Portfolios will be able to effect a
closing purchase transaction for the options it has written.


Effecting a closing purchase transaction in the case of a written call option
will permit the Portfolios to write another call option on the underlying
security with a different exercise price, expiration date, or both. Effecting a
closing purchase transaction will also permit the Portfolios to use cash or
proceeds from the investments. If a Portfolio desires to sell a particular
security from its portfolio on which it has written a call option, it will
effect a closing purchase transaction before or at the same time as the sale of
the security.


The Portfolios will realize a profit from a closing purchase transaction if the
price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the
option. Likewise, the Portfolios will realize a loss from a closing purchase
transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received
from writing the option. Because increases in the market price of a call option
will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security,
any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option is likely to be offset
in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying security owned by a
Portfolio.


WRITING OVER-THE-COUNTER ("OTC") OPTIONS. The Portfolios may engage in options
transactions that trade on the OTC market to the same extent that it intends to
engage in exchange traded options. Just as with exchange traded options, OTC
options give the holder the right to buy an underlying security from, or sell an
underlying security to, an option writer at a stated exercise price. However,
OTC options differ from exchange traded options in certain material respects.


OTC options are arranged directly with dealers and not, as is the case with
exchange traded options, through a clearing corporation. Thus, there is a risk
of non-performance by the dealer. Because there is no exchange, pricing is
typically done by reference to information obtained from market makers. Since
OTC options are available for a greater variety of securities and in a wider
range of expiration dates and exercise prices, the writer of an OTC option is
paid the premium in advance by the dealer.


A writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it voluntarily only
by entering into a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that a
continuously liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option at any
specific time. Consequently, the Portfolios may be able to realize the value of
an OTC option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing
sale transaction with the dealer that issued it. Similarly, when a Portfolio
writes an OTC option, it generally can close out that option prior to its
expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer
to which it originally wrote to option. If a covered call option writer cannot
effect a closing transaction, it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign
currency until the option expires or the option is exercised. Therefore, the
writer of a covered OTC call option may not be able to sell an underlying
security even though it might otherwise be advantageous to do so. Likewise, the
writer of a secured OTC put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged
to secure the put for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put
writer. Similarly, a purchaser of an OTC put or call option might also find it
difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a
secondary market.


The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has often taken the position
that purchased OTC options and the assets used to "cover" written OTC options
are illiquid securities. The Portfolios will adopt procedures for engaging in
OTC options transactions for the purpose of reducing any potential adverse
effect of such transactions on the liquidity of the Portfolios.


FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Portfolios may buy and sell stock index
futures contracts traded on domestic stock exchanges to hedge the value of its
portfolio against changes in market conditions. A stock index futures contract
is an agreement between two parties to take or make delivery of an amount of
cash equal to a specified dollar amount, times the difference between the stock
index value at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price
at which the futures contract is originally struck. A stock index futures
contract does not involve the physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the
index. Although stock index futures contracts call for the actual taking or
delivery or cash, in most cases a Portfolio expects to liquidate its stock
index futures positions through offsetting transactions, which may result in a
gain or a loss, before cash settlement is required.


Each Portfolio will incur brokerage fees when it purchases and sells stock index
futures contracts, and at the time a Portfolio purchases or sells a stock
index futures contract, it must make a good faith deposit known as the "initial
margin". Thereafter, a Portfolio may need to make subsequent deposits, known
as "variation margin", to reflect changes in the level of the stock index. Each
Portfolio may buy or sell a stock index futures contract so long as the sum of
the amount of margin deposits on open positions with respect to all stock index
futures contracts does not exceed 5% of a Portfolio's net assets.


To the extent a Portfolio enters into a stock index futures contract, it will
maintain with its custodian bank (to the extent required by the rules of the
SEC) assets in a segregated account to cover its obligations. Such assets may
consist of cash, cash equivalents, or high quality debt securities from its
portfolio in an amount equal to the difference between the fluctuating market
value of such futures contract and the aggregate value of the initial and
variation margin payments.


RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS AND FUTURES. Although the Portfolios may write
covered call options and purchase and sell stock index futures contracts to
hedge against declines in market value of their portfolio securities, the use of
these instruments involves certain risks. As the writer of covered call options,
each Portfolio receives a premium but loses any opportunity to profit from an
increase in the market price of the underlying securities declines, though the
premium received may partially offset such loss.


Although stock index futures contracts may be useful in hedging against adverse
changes in the value of each Portfolio's investment securities, they are
derivative instruments that are subject to a number of risks. During certain
market conditions, purchases and sales of stock index futures contracts may not
completely offset a decline or rise in the value of each Portfolio's
investments. In the futures markets, it may not always be possible to execute a
buy or sell order at the desired price, or to close out an open position due to
market conditions, limits on open positions and/or daily price fluctuations.
Changes in the market value of each Portfolio's investment securities may differ
substantially from the changes anticipated by a Portfolio when it established
its hedged positions, and unanticipated price movements in a futures contract
may result in a loss substantially greater than such Portfolio's initial
investment in such a contract.


Successful use of futures contracts depends upon the sub-adviser's ability to
correctly predict movements in the securities markets generally or of a
particular segment of a securities market. No assurance can be given that the
sub-adviser's judgment in this respect will be correct.


The CFTC and the various exchanges have established limits referred to as
"speculative position limits" on the maximum net long or net short position that
any person may hold or control in a particular futures contract. Trading limits
are imposed on the number of contracts that any person may trade on a particular
trading day. An exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in
violation of these limits and it may impose sanctions or restrictions. These
trading and positions limits will not have an adverse impact on a Portfolio's
strategies for hedging its securities.





INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RISKS OF THE KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO
The following paragraphs provide a more detailed description of the Kinetics
Government Money Market Portfolio's (for the purpose of this section, the
"Portfolio") investment policies and risks identified in the Prospectus. Unless
otherwise noted, the policies described below are not fundamental and may be
changed by the Board of Trustees of the Trust without shareholder approval.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Portfolio may invest in repurchase agreements which
are arrangements with banks, brokers/dealers, and other recognized financial
institutions to sell securities to the Portfolio and to repurchase them at a
mutually agreed upon time and price within one year from the date of
acquisition. The Portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the
securities subject to the terms of the repurchase agreements, and these
securities will be marked to market daily. To the extent that the original
seller does not repurchase the securities from the Portfolio, the Portfolio
could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities.


In the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became
insolvent, disposition of such securities by the Portfolio might be delayed
pending court action. The Portfolio believes that under the regular procedures
normally in effect for custody of the Portfolio's assets subject to repurchase
agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the
Portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities. The Portfolio
will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized
financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed by the
Portfolio's adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the
Board of Trustees.


WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. The Portfolio may purchase
short-term obligations on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These
transactions are arrangements in which the Portfolio purchases securities with
payment and delivery scheduled for a future time. The seller's failure to
complete these transactions may cause the Portfolio to miss a price or yield
considered advantageous. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering
into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may
vary from the purchase prices.


The Portfolio may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the investment
adviser deems it appropriate to do so. In addition, the Portfolio may enter into
transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market
values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar
securities at later dates. The Portfolio may realize short-term profits or
losses upon the sale of such commitments.


These transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous
price or yield for the Portfolio. No fees or other expenses, other than normal
transaction costs, are incurred. However, liquid assets of the Portfolio
sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on
the Portfolio's records at the trade date. These assets are marked to market
daily and are maintained until the transaction is settled. The Portfolio does
not intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions to an
extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20% of the total value of
its assets.


OTHER MONEY MARKET FUNDS. As an efficient means of carrying out the investment
policies, the Portfolio may invest in the securities of other money market
funds. A disadvantage to investing in other money market funds is that they also
carry certain expenses such as management fees. As a result, any investment by
the Portfolio in shares of other money market funds may duplicate certain
shareholder expenses.


MORE ABOUT THE ASIA TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO'S INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE
DRIVEN COMPANIES. The sub-adviser for the ASIA TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO believes
that because of rapid advances in technology, science, and biotechnology, an
investment in companies with business operations in these areas will offer
substantial opportunities for long-term capital appreciation. Of course, prices
of common stocks of even the best managed, most profitable corporations are
subject to market risk, which means their stock prices can decline. In addition,
swings in investor psychology or significant trading by large institutional
investors can result in price fluctuations. Industries likely to be represented
in the portfolio include the Internet, computers, networking and internetworking
software, computer aided design, telecommunications, media and information
services, medical devices and biotechnology. The Portfolio may also invest in
the stocks of companies that should benefit from the commercialization of
technological advances, although they may not be directly involved in research
and development.


The technology, science, and biotechnology areas have exhibited and continue to
exhibit rapid growth due to the mass adoption of the Internet, both through
increasing demand for existing products and services and the broadening of the
technology market. In general, the stocks of large capitalized companies that
are well established in the technology market can be expected to grow with the
market and will frequently be found in the Portfolio's cache of investment
securities. The expansion of technology and its related industries, however,
also provides a favorable environment for investment in small to medium
capitalized companies. The Portfolio's investment policies are not limited to
any minimum capitalization requirement and the Portfolio may hold securities
without regard to the capitalization of the issuer. The sub-adviser's overall
stock selection for the Portfolio is not based on the capitalization or size of
the company but rather on an assessment of the company's fundamental prospects.


Companies in the rapidly changing fields of technology, science, and
biotechnology face special risks. For example, their products or services may
not prove commercially successful or may become obsolete quickly. The value of
the Portfolio's shares may be susceptible to factors affecting the technology
and science areas and to greater risk and market fluctuation than an investment
in a fund that invests in a broader range of portfolio securities not
concentrated in any particular industry. As such, the Portfolio is not an
appropriate investment for individuals who are not long-term investors and who,
as their primary objective, require safety of principal or stable income from
their investments. The technology, science, and biotechnology areas may be
subject to greater governmental regulation than many other areas and changes in
governmental policies and the need for regulatory approvals may have a material
adverse effect on these areas. Additionally, companies in these areas may be
subject to risks of developing technologies, competitive pressures and other
factors and are dependent upon consumer and business acceptance as new
technologies evolve.



TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS





Due to the changing nature of the Internet and related companies, the national
economy and market conditions, the INTERNET PORTFOLIO, INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
PORTFOLIO, INTERNET EMERGING GROWTH PORTFOLIO, INTERNET GLOBAL GROWTH PORTFOLIO
and NEW PARADIGM PORTFOLIO may, as a temporary defensive measure, invest without
limitation, in short-term debt securities and money market securities with a
rating of A2-P2 or higher.


Due to the changing nature of the medical research, biopharmaceutical and
treatment industry, the national economy and market conditions, the MEDICAL
PORTFOLIO may, as a temporary defensive measure, invest without limitation, in
short-term money market securities with a rating of A2-P2 or higher.


Due to the changing nature of the energy industry and alternative energy
resources technology, the national economy and market conditions, the ENERGY
PORTFOLIO may, as a temporary defensive measure, invest without limitation, in
short-term money market securities with a rating of A2-P2 or higher.


In order to have funds available for redemption and investment opportunities,
the Portfolios, except the KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO, may also
hold a portion of their assets in cash or U.S. short-term money market
instruments. Certificates of deposit purchased by the Portfolios will be those
of U.S. banks having total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $1
billion, and bankers' acceptances purchased by the Portfolios will be guaranteed
by U.S. or foreign banks having total assets at the time of purchase in excess
of $1 billion. The Portfolios anticipate that not more than 10% of its total
assets will be so invested or held in cash at any given time, except when the
Portfolios are in a temporary defensive posture.



PORTFOLIO TURNOVER





In order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded regulated
investment companies, and to be relieved of Federal tax liabilities, both the
Funds and the Portfolios must distribute substantially all of their net income
to shareholders generally on an annual basis. Thus, the Portfolios may have to
dispose of portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate
cash or borrow cash in order to satisfy the distribution requirement. The
Portfolios do not trade in securities for short-term profits but, when
circumstances warrant, securities may be sold without regard to the length of
time they have been held.






MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIOS






BOARD OF TRUSTEES



The management and affairs of the Portfolios are supervised by the Board of
Trustees of the Trust. The Board consists of the same eight individuals, five of
whom are not "interested persons" of the Trust as that term is defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Trustees are
fiduciaries for the Portfolios' shareholders and are governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware in this regard. Each Board establishes policies for the
operation of the Portfolios and appoints the officers who conduct the daily
business of the Portfolios. Officers and Trustees of the Trust are listed below
with their addresses, present positions with the Trust and principal occupations
over at least the last five years.

* "Interested person" as defined under the 1940 Act.


*** Murray Stahl became an "interested person" of the Fund (as defined under the
1940 Act) as of December 15, 1999. Previous to becoming an interested person,
Mr. Stahl received $3,844 as total compensation from the Fund and Fund complex
for being an independent director.



MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP



The percentage of the Portfolio's interests owned or controlled by the executive
officers and/or Trustees of the Portfolios is less than 1% of the interest of
the Portfolio.






CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES





A control person is one who owns beneficially or through controlled companies
more than 25% of the voting securities of a company or acknowledge the existence
of control. As of the commencement of investment operations, the Portfolios
could be deemed to be under the control of Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc. through
its series, The Internet Fund, The Internet Infrastructure Fund, The Internet
Emerging Growth Fund, The Internet Global Growth Fund, The Internet New Paradigm
Fund, The Small Cap Opportunities Fund, The Middle East Growth Fund, The Medical
Fund, The Asia Technology Fund, Energy Fund, and The Kinetics Government Money
Market Fund (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds"). Kinetics Mutual Funds,
Inc., was the sole investor in the Portfolio as of the date of this SAI.
Similarly, as of such time, Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc. through the Funds, was
the owner of 100% of the value of the outstanding interests in the Trust. Any
investor owing more than 50% of the value of the outstanding interests in the
Portfolio may take actions without the approval of any other investor who
invests in the Portfolio.






INVESTMENT ADVISERS





Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. ("Kinetics" or the "Adviser") is a New York
corporation that serves as the investment adviser to the Portfolios. Steven R.
Samson is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Kinetics. Mr. Samson has
over 24 years experience in the mutual funds and financial services industries.
Mr. Lee Schultheis is the Chief Operating Officer of Kinetics and has more than
20 years experience in the mutual funds and financial services industries.


On April 25, 2000, the Board of the Trustees of the Trust, on behalf of the
Portfolios, approved a management and advisory contract (the "Agreement") with
Kinetics. This Agreement continues on a year-to-year basis provided that
specific approval is voted at least annually by the Board of Trustees of the
Trust or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of the Portfolios. In either event, it must also be approved by a
majority of the trustees of the Portfolio who are neither parties to the
Agreement nor "interested persons" as defined in the 1940 Act at a meeting
called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Adviser's investment
decisions are made subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of
Trustees. The Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of
any penalty, by the Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Portfolios. Ultimate decisions as to the
investment policy and as to individual purchases and sales of securities are
made by the Portfolio's officers and the Trustees.


Under the Agreement, Kinetics furnishes investment advice to the Portfolios by
continuously reviewing the portfolio and recommending to the Portfolios to what
extent, securities should be purchased or disposed. Pursuant to the Agreement,
the Adviser:


(1) renders research, statistical and advisory services to the Portfolios;

(2) makes specific recommendations based on the Portfolios' investment
requirements;

(3) pays the salaries of those of the Portfolios' employees who may be officers
or directors or employees of the investment adviser.



SUB-ADVISER



On June 20, 2000, the Board of Trustees, on behalf of the ASIA TECHNOLOGY
PORTFOLIO, approved a sub-advisory agreement between the Adviser and UOB Global
Capital LLC (the "sub-adviser"), pursuant to which the sub-adviser will assist
it in the day-to-day management of the investment portfolio. The sub-advisory
agreement continues on a year-to-year basis provided that specific approval is
voted at least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by the vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio.
In either event, it must also be approved by a majority of the trustees of the
Portfolio who are neither parties to the Agreement nor "interested persons" as
defined in the 1940 Act at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
approval. The Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of
any penalty, by the Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio. In the event that the Advisory
Agreement under any circumstances, the sub-advisory agreement shall also
automatically be terminated.


The sub-adviser determines which securities will be purchased, retained or sold
for the ASIA TECHNOLOGY Portfolio, places orders for the Portfolio and provides
the investment adviser with information on international investment and economic
developments


The sub-adviser is located at 592 Fifth Avenue, Suite 602, New York, New York
10036. The sub-adviser has entered into an arrangement with its affiliate, UOB
Asset Management Ltd. (UOBAM), pursuant to which UOBAM has agreed to make
available certain of its investment, operations and compliance personnel to the
sub-adviser. UOBAM is located at UOB Plaza 2, 80 Raffles Place, #03-00,
Singapore 048624. At December 31, 1999, together with its affiliates, the
sub-adviser had discretionary management authority over approximately $2.17
billion in assets.


Under the Sub Advisory Agreement, Kinetics supervises the sub-adviser which, in
turn, furnishes investment advice to the Fund by continuously reviewing the
portfolio and recommending to the Fund when, and to what extent, securities
should be purchased or disposed. The sub-adviser's investment decisions are made
subject to the direction and supervision of the Adviser and the Board of
Trustees. Ultimate decisions as to the investment policy and as to individual
purchases and sales of securities are made by the Portfolio's officers and the
Trustees. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Adviser is responsible directly, or
indirectly through the sub-adviser, for:


(1) rendering research, statistical and advisory services to the Portfolio;

(2) making specific recommendations based on the Portfolio's investment
requirements; and

(3) paying the salaries of those of the Portfolio's employees who may be
officers or directors or employees of the investment adviser.



ADVISORY FEES



For the above services, the Portfolios have each agreed to pay to Kinetics an
annual fee of 1.25%, (or 0.50% in the case of the KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY
MARKET FUND) of the Portfolios' average daily net assets. All fees are computed
on the average daily closing net asset value ("NAV") of the Portfolio and are
payable monthly. The fee is higher than the fee paid by most other funds.



SUB-ADVISORY FEES



For the ASIA TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, the investment adviser pays the sub-adviser's
fees of 0.625% of the Portfolio's management fee of 1.25% of average daily net
assets out of the Adviser's annual advisory fees. All fees are computed on the
average daily closing net asset value ("NAV") of the Portfolio and are payable
monthly.


Kinetics has also entered into a Research Agreement with Horizon Assets
Management, Inc. ("Horizon") for which it is solely responsible for the payment
of all fees owing to Horizon.


Fees of the custodian, administrator, fund accountant and transfer agent are
paid by the Funds or by the Portfolios or by the Funds and the Portfolios
jointly, as more fully described below. The Funds pay all other expenses,
including:


o fees and expenses of directors not affiliated with the Adviser;

o legal and accounting fees;

o interest, taxes, and brokerage commissions; and

o record keeping and the expense of operating its offices.



PRIVATE PLACEMENT AGENT



Kinetics Funds Distributor, Inc. ("KFDI"), serves as the private placement agent
for the shares of the Portfolio on a best efforts basis. KFDI is a registered
broker-dealer and member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Beneficial Interests in the Portfolio are issued continuously.



ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES





Kinetics also serves as Administrator of the Funds and the Portfolios. Under an
Administrative Services Agreement with the Funds, Kinetics will be entitled to
receive an annual administration fee equal to 0.10% of the Portfolios' average
daily net assets of which Kinetics will be responsible for the payment of a
portion of such fees to Firstar Mutual Fund Services, LLC ("Firstar") for
certain sub-administrative services rendered to the Portfolios by Firstar.


Firstar, located at 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, also
serves as the Funds' accountant and transfer agent. As such, Firstar provides
certain shareholder services and record management services as well as acts as
the Portfolios' dividend disbursement agent.


Administrative services include, but are not limited to, providing office space,
equipment, telephone facilities, various personnel, including clerical and
supervisory, and computers, as is necessary or beneficial to:


|X| establish and maintain shareholders' accounts and records,
|X| process purchase and redemption transactions,
|X| process automatic investments of client account cash balances,
|X| answer routine client inquiries regarding the Portfolios,
|X| assist clients in changing dividend options,
|X| account designations, and addresses, and
|X| providing such other services as the Portfolios may reasonably request.



CUSTODIAN





Firstar Bank, N.A. ("Firstar Bank") is custodian for the securities and cash of
the Portfolios. Under a Custody Agreement, Firstar Bank holds the Portfolios'
assets in safekeeping and keeps all necessary records and documents relating to
its duties.






VALUATION OF SHARES





Unless otherwise noted, the following applies to all the Portfolios except the


KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO.



Shares of the Portfolios are sold on a continual basis at the NAV per share next
computed following acceptance of an order by the Portfolios. The Portfolios' NAV
per share for the purpose of pricing purchase and redemption orders is
determined at the close of normal trading (currently 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on
each day the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open for trading. The NYSE is
closed on the following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Day,
President's Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.


The Portfolios' investment securities are valued each day at the last quoted
sales price on the securities principal exchange. If market quotations are not
readily available, securities will be valued at their fair market value as
determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Board of
Trustees. The Portfolios may use independent pricing services to assist in
calculating the NAV of the Portfolio's shares.


The Portfolios' investment securities that are listed on a U.S. securities
exchange or NASDAQ for which market quotations are readily available are valued
at the last quoted sale price on the day the valuation is made. Price
information on listed securities is taken from the exchange where the security
is primarily traded. Options, futures, unlisted U.S. securities and listed U.S.
securities not traded on the valuation date for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the mean of the most recent quoted bid and asked
price.


Fixed-income securities (other than obligations having a maturity of 60 days or
less) are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from pricing services,
which take into account appropriate factors such as institutional sized trading
in similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of
issue, trading characteristics and other market data. Fixed-income securities
purchased with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost if it reflects fair value. In the event that amortized cost does not
reflect market, market prices as determined above will be used. Other assets and
securities for which no quotations are readily available (including restricted
securities) will be valued in good faith at fair value using methods determined
by the Board of Trustees of the Portfolios.


Shares of the KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO are sold on a continual
basis at its NAV, which is determined by the Portfolio as of 12:00 p.m. Eastern
time each day the NYSE is open for unrestricted business. The KINETICS
GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO will utilize the amortized cost method in
valuing its portfolio securities. This method involves valuing a security at its
cost adjusted by a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium,
regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of
the instrument. The purpose of this method of calculation is to facilitate the
maintenance of a consistent net asset value per share for the Portfolio of
$1.00. However, there is no assurance that the $1.00 net asset value per share
will be maintained.



PURCHASING SHARES





Shares of beneficial interest in the Portfolios are sold without a sales load, a
the NAV next determined after an order is received by the Portfolios. Shares in
the Portfolios are sold solely in private placement transactions that do not
involve any "public offering" within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933
Act. Investments in the Portfolios may be made only by regulated investment
companies, unregulated foreign investment companies, U.S. and non-U.S.
institutional investors, S corporations, insurance company separate accounts,
and certain qualified pension and retirement plans. This Registration Statement
does not constitute an offer to seel, or the solicitation of any offer to buy,
any "security" within the meaning of the 1933 Act.


There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in the Portfolios. The
Portfolios reserve the right to cease accepting investments at any time or to
reject any investment order.



REDEMPTION OF SHARES





An investor in the Portfolios may redeem all or any portion of its investment at
the NAV next determined after a redemption request in good order is received by
a Portfolio. The proceeds of a redemption will be paid by the Portfolios in
federal funds normally on the Business Day that the redemption is effected, but
in any event within three business days, except as extensions may be permitted
by law.


The Portfolios reserve the right to pay redemptions in kind. Unless requested by
an investor or deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interests of the
investors in a Portfolio as a group, the Portfolios will not pay a redemption in
kind to an investor, except in situations where that investor may pay
redemptions in kind.


The right of any investor to receive payment with respect to any redemption may
be suspended, or the payment of the redemption proceeds postponed, during any
period in which the NYSE is closed or trading on the NYSE is restricted or to
the extent otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act.



BROKERAGE





The Portfolios' assets are invested by the Adviser in a manner consistent with
its investment objective, strategies, policies and restrictions and with any
instructions the Board of Trustees may issue from time to time. Within this
framework, the Adviser is responsible for making all determinations as to the
purchase and sale of portfolio securities and for taking all steps necessary to
implement securities transactions on behalf of the Portfolios.


Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges, commodities markets and futures markets
and other agency transactions may involve the payment by the Adviser on behalf
of the Portfolios of negotiated brokerage commissions. Such commissions vary
among different brokers. A particular broker may charge different commissions
according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction.
Transactions in foreign investments often involve the payment of fixed brokerage
commissions, which may be higher than those in the United States. There is
generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the
over-the-counter markets, but the price paid by the Adviser usually includes an
undisclosed dealer commission or mark-up. In underwritten offerings, the price
paid by the Adviser on behalf of the Portfolios includes a disclosed, fixed
commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer.


U.S. Government securities generally are traded in the over-the-counter market
through broker-dealers. A broker-dealer is a securities firm or bank that makes
a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly
higher price. The difference between the prices is known as a spread.


In placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the
Portfolios, the Adviser seeks to obtain the best price and execution, taking
into account such factors as price, size of order, difficulty and risk of
execution and operational facilities of the firm involved. For securities traded
in the over-the-counter markets, the Adviser deals directly with the dealers who
make markets in these securities unless better prices and execution are
available elsewhere. The Adviser negotiates commission rates with brokers based
on the quality and quantity of services provided in light of generally
prevailing rates, and while the Adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive
commission rates, the Portfolio does not necessarily pay the lowest commissions
available. The Board of Trustees periodically reviews the commission rates and
allocation of orders.


When consistent with the objectives of best price and execution, business may be
placed with broker-dealers who furnish investment research or services to the
Adviser. Such research or services include advice, both orally and in writing,
as to the value of securities; the advisability of investing in, purchasing or
selling securities; and the availability of securities, or purchasers or sellers
of securities; as well as analyses and reports concerning issues, industries,
securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance
of accounts. To the extent portfolio transactions are effected with
broker-dealers who furnish research services to the Adviser, the Adviser
receives a benefit, not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts, without
providing any direct monetary benefit to the Portfolio from these transactions.
The Adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally
benefit several or all of the investment companies and private accounts which it
manages, as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account.


The Trust, on behalf of a Portfolio, may also enter into arrangements, commonly
referred to as "broker/service arrangements" with broker-dealers pursuant to
which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the cost of certain products or services
provided to the Portfolio in exchange for fund brokerage. Under a typical
brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a portion the Portfolio's
custodian, administrative or transfer agency fees, etc., and, in exchange, the
Portfolio agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The
Adviser, on behalf of the Trust, usually negotiates the terms of the contract
with the service provider, which is paid directly by the broker.


The same security may be suitable for a Portfolio, another portfolio series of
the Trust or other private accounts managed by the Adviser. If and when a
Portfolio and two or more accounts simultaneously purchase or sell the same
security, the transactions will be allocated as to price and amount in
accordance with arrangements equitable to the Portfolios and the accounts. The
simultaneous purchase or sale of the same securities by a Portfolio and other
accounts may have a detrimental effect on a Portfolio, as this may affect the
price paid or received by a Portfolio or the size of the position obtainable or
able to be sold by a Portfolio.


Consistent with the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and subject to seeking the most favorable price and execution
available and such other policies as the Trustees may determine, the Adviser may
consider sales of shares of a Portfolio as a factor in the selection of
broker-dealers to execute portfolio transactions for a Portfolio.



TAXES





The Portfolios will be classified for federal income tax purposes as
partnerships that are not "publicly traded partnerships." As a result, the
Portfolios are not subject to federal income tax; instead, each Interestholder
in a Portfolio is required to take into account in determining its federal
income tax liability its share of the particular Portfolio's income, gains,
losses, deductions, and credits, without regard to whether it has received any
cash distributions from a Portfolio. The Portfolios are also not subject to
Delaware income or franchise tax.


A holder of beneficial interest in a Portfolio (an "Interestholder") is deemed
to own a proportionate share of that Portfolio's assets and to earn a
proportionate share of that Portfolio's income, for, among other things,
purposes of determining whether the Interestholder satisfies the requirements to
qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC"). Accordingly, the Portfolios
intend to conduct their operations so that their Interestholders that invest
substantially all of their assets in a Portfolio and intend to qualify as RICs
should be able to satisfy all those requirements.


Distributions to an Interestholder from a Portfolio (whether pursuant to a
partial or complete withdrawal or otherwise) will not result in the
Interestholder's recognition of any gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes, except that: (1) gain will be recognized to the extent any cash that
is distributed exceeds the Interestholder's basis for its interest in a
Portfolio before the distribution; (2) income or gain will be recognized if the
distribution is in liquidation of the Interestholder's entire interest in a
Portfolio and includes a disproportionate share of any unrealized receivables
held by a Portfolio; (3) loss will be recognized to the extent that a
liquidation distribution consisting solely of cash and/or unrealized receivables
is less than the Interestholder's basis for its interest in a Portfolio prior to
the distribution; and (4) gain or loss may be recognized on a distribution to an
Interestholder that contributed property to a Portfolio. An Interestholder's
basis for its interest in a Portfolio generally will equal the amount of cash
and the basis of any property it invests in a Portfolio, increased by the
Interestholder's share of that Portfolio's net income and gains and decreased by

(a) the amount of cash and the basis of any property the Portfolio distributes
to the Interestholder and (b) the Interestholder's share of the Portfolio's
losses.


The income tax and estate tax consequences to a non-U.S. Interestholder entitled
to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may be different from those
described herein. Non-U.S. Interestholders may be required to provide
appropriate documentation to establish their entitlement to the benefits of such
a treaty. Non-U.S. Interestholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers
with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the
Portfolios.


The foregoing discussion relates only to federal income tax law. Income from the
Portfolios also may be subject to foreign, state and local taxes, and their
treatment under foreign, state and local income tax laws may differ from the
federal income tax treatment. Interestholders should consult their tax advisors
with respect to particular questions of federal, state and local taxation.






PERFORMANCE INFORMATION






TOTAL RETURN



Average annual total return quotations used in the Portfolios' advertising and
promotional materials are calculated according to the following formula:


P(1+T)n = ERV


where P equals a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000; T equals average annual
total return; n equals the number of years; and ERV equals the ending redeemable
value at the end of the period of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the
beginning of the period.


Under the foregoing formula, the time periods used in advertising will be based
on rolling calendar quarters, updated to the last day of the most recent quarter
prior to submission of the advertising for publication. Average annual total
return, or "T" in the above formula, is computed by finding the average annual
compounded rates of return over the period that would equate the initial amount
invested to the ending redeemable value. Average annual total return assumes the
reinvestment of all dividends and distributions.



CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN



Cumulative total return represents the simple change in value of an investment
over a stated period and may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount.
Total returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital
(including capital gains and changes in share price) in order to illustrate the
relationship between these factors and their contributions to total return.



YIELD



Annualized yield quotations used in a Portfolio's advertising and promotional
materials are calculated by dividing that Portfolio's interest income for a
specified thirty-day period, net of expenses, by the average number of shares
outstanding during the period, and expressing the result as an annualized
percentage (assuming semi-annual compounding) of the NAV per share at the end of
the period. Yield quotations are calculated according to the following formula:



YIELD =  2[(a-b + 1)6 - 1]





c-d


where "a" equals dividends and interest earned during the period; "b" equals
expenses accrued for the period, net of reimbursements; "c" equals the average
daily number of shares outstanding during the period that are entitled to
receive dividends; and "d" equals the maximum offering price per share on the
last day of the period.


For purposes of these calculations, the maturity of an obligation with one or
more call provisions is assumed to be the next date on which the obligation
reasonably can be expected to be called or, if none, the maturity date.



OTHER INFORMATION



The Portfolios' performance data quoted in advertising and other promotional
materials represents past performance and is not intended to predict or indicate
future results. The return and principal value of an investment in the
Portfolios will fluctuate, and an investor's redemption proceeds may be more or
less than the original investment amount.


If permitted by applicable law, the Portfolios may advertise the performance of
registered investment companies or private accounts that have investment
objectives, policies and strategies substantially similar to those of the Funds.



COMPARISON OF PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE



The performance of the Portfolios, other than the KINETICS GOVERNMENT MONEY
MARKET PORTFOLIO, may be compared to data prepared by Lipper Analytical
Services, Inc., CDA Investment Technologies, Inc., Morningstar, Inc., the
Donoghue Organization, Inc. or other independent services which monitor the
performance of investment companies, and may be quoted in advertising in terms
of its ranking in each applicable universe. In addition, the Portfolio may use
performance data reported in financial and industry publications, including
Barron's, Business Week, Forbes, Fortune, Investor's Daily, IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report, Money Magazine, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.


The Portfolios may from time to time use the following unmanaged indices for
performance comparison purposes:


o S&P 500 - The S&P 500 is an index of 500 stocks designed to mimic the overall
equity market's industry weightings. Most, but not all, large capitalization
stocks are in the index. There are also some small capitalization names in the
index. The list is maintained by Standard & Poor's Corporation. It is market
capitalization weighted. There are always 500 issuers in the S&P 500. Changes
are made by Standard & Poor's as needed.


o NASDAQ Composite - The NASDAQ Composite Index is a broad-based capitalization

- weighted index of all NASDAQ stocks.

Report of Independent Accountants



To the Shareholder and Board of Trustees of
Kinetics Portfolios Trust


In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kinetics Portfolios
Trust (hereafter referred to as the "Trust") at April 27, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. This
financial statement is the responsibility of the Trust's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of this financial statement in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Milwaukee, Wisconsin


April 27, 2000


The accompanying notes are an integral part of this financial statement.


1.   ORGANIZATION


The Kinetics Portfolios Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware
Business Trust on March 14, 2000 and is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end management
investment company issuing its beneficial interests in series, each series
representing a distinct portfolio with its own investment objectives and
policies. The series currently authorized are The Internet Portfolio, The
Internet Emerging Growth Portfolio, The Internet Global Growth Portfolio,
The Internet New Paradigm Portfolio, The Internet Infrastructure Portfolio,
The Medical Portfolio, The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, The
Small Cap Opportunities Portfolio and The Middle East Growth Portfolio (the
"Portfolios"). Pursuant to the 1940 Act, the Portfolios are
"non-diversified" series of the Trust. The Trust has had no operations
other than the contribution by Kinetics Asset Management, Inc., the
Portfolios' Adviser ("Adviser"), of $100,000, representing a beneficial
interest in the Trust. The Portfolios have had no operations through April
27, 2000. On April 28, 2000, the Trust intends to distribute the Adviser's
$100,000 contribution to the Portfolios, at which time the Adviser will
become a partner in each of the Portfolios. In addition, on April 28, 2000
various feeder funds ("Funds") sponsored by the Adviser will invest their
investable assets in the corresponding Portfolios under a master-feeder
capital structure.


2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



ORGANIZATION COSTS



Expenses in connection with the organization of the Trust have been
absorbed by the Funds prior to their conversion to the master-feeder
capital structure. Accordingly, no statement of operations of the Trust has
been provided.



FEDERAL INCOME TAXES



Each Portfolio intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes. Therefore, the Portfolios believe they will not be subject to any
federal income tax on their income and net realized capital gains (if any).
However, each investor in the Portfolios will be taxed on its allocable
share of the Portfolio's income and capital gains for purposes of
determining its federal income tax liability.



USE OF ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






3.   INVESTMENT ADVISER


The Trust has an Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") with
Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), with whom certain officers
and trustees of the Trust are affiliated, to furnish investment advisory
services to the Portfolios. Under the terms of the Agreement, the
Portfolios compensate the Adviser for its management services at the annual
rate of 1.25% of the Portfolio's average daily net assets, except for The
Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, which compensates the Adviser
at a rate of 0.50% of the Portfolio's average daily net assets.


The Adviser also serves as administrator to the Portfolios. Under an
Administrative Services Agreement with the Trust on behalf of the
Portfolios, the Adviser receives an annual administration fee equal to
0.10% of the Portfolio's average daily net assets from which the Adviser
will be responsible for the payment of a portion of such fees to Firstar
Mutual Fund Services, LLC ("Firstar") for certain sub-administrative
services rendered to the Portfolios by Firstar.







APPENDIX






STANDARD & POOR'S ("S&P") CORPORATE BOND RATING DEFINITIONS



AAA-Debt rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by S&P. Capacity to pay
interest and repay principal is extremely strong.


AA-Debt rated "AA" has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal and differs from the higher-rated issues only in small degree.


A-Debt rated "A" has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal,
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher-rated categories.


BBB-Debt rated "BBB" is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for
debt in this category than in higher-rated categories.


BB, B, CCC, CC-Debt rated "BB", "B", "CCC", and "CC" is regarded, on balance, as
predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay
principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. "BB" indicates the
lowest degree of speculation and "CC" the highest degree of speculation. While
such debt will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these
are outweighed by large uncertainties of major risk exposures to adverse
conditions.


CI-The rating "CI" is reversed for income bonds on which no interest is being
paid.


D-Debt rated "D" is in default, and payment of interest and/or repayment of
principal is in arrears.



MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. CORPORATE BOND RATING DEFINITIONS



AAA-Bonds which are rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt
edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or an exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues.


AA-Bonds which are rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally known as
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective
elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that
make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.


A-Bonds which are rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and are
to be considered as upper medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the near future.


BAA-Bonds which are rated "Baa" are considered as medium-grade obligations
(i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest payments
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in
fact, have speculative characteristics as well.


BA-Bonds which are "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their future
cannot be considered well assured. Often the protection of interest and
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during
both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes
bonds in this class.


B-Bonds which are rated "B" generally lack characteristics of a desirable
investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.


CAA-Bonds which are rated "Caa" are of poor standing. Such issues may be in
default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.


CA-Bonds which are "Ca" represent obligations which are speculative in a high
degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.


C-Bonds which are rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing.



FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. BOND RATING DEFINITIONS



AAA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.


AA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong, although
not quite as strong as bonds rated "AAA." Because bonds rated in the "AAA" and
"AA" categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future
developments, short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated "F-1+."


A-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered strong, but
may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.


BBB-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality.
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and therefore impair timely
payment. The likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.


BB-Bonds are considered speculative. The obligor's ability to pay interest and
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes. However,
business and financial alternatives can be identified which could assist the
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.


B-Bonds are considered highly speculative. While bonds in this class are
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal and interest reflects the obligor's limited margin of
safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the
life of the issue.


CCC-Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to default. The ability to meet obligations requires an advantageous
business and economic environment.


CC-Bonds are minimally protected. Default in payment of interest and/or
principal seems probable over time.


C-Bonds are in imminent default in payment of interest or principal.


DDD, DD, AND D-Bonds are in default on interest and/or principal payments. Such
bonds are extremely speculative and should be valued on the basis of their
ultimate recovery value in liquidation or reorganization of the obligor. "DDD"
represents the highest potential for recovery on these bonds, and "D" represents
the lowest potential for recovery.

Item 24.          PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH


REGISTRANT Registrant is not controlled by or under common
control with any person.






Item 25.          INDEMNIFICATION



Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers
and controlling persons of the Registrant, the Registrant has
been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer
or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it
is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.






Item 26.          BUSINESS AND OTHER CONNECTIONS OF INVESTMENT ADVISER:



Besides serving as investment adviser to the Portfolios and to
Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc., the Adviser is not currently (and
has not during the past two years) engaged in any other
business, profession, vocation or employment of a substantial
nature. Information regarding the business, vocation or
employment of a substantial nature of the Adviser and its
officers is incorporated by reference to the information
contained in Part B of this Registration Statement.






Item 27.          PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITERS:



(a)      As of this date of filing, Kinetics Funds Distributors, Inc.
("KFDI"), is the private placement agent for shares of the
Registrant.


(b)      To the best of Registrant's knowledge, as of the date of
filing, Lee W. Schultheis is the President and sole director
of KFDI.  The address of KFDI is 1311 Mamaroneck Avenue,
White Plains, New York 10605.  Mr. Schultheis is the Vice
President and Treasurer of the Registrant.

Principal Risks of Investment
Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money. The principal risks of investing in the Internet Portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and the value of the Internet Portfolio and your investment.
�


���
Stock Market Risks: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in value, the Internet Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment.
�


���
Stock Selection Risks: The portfolio securities selected by the Investment Adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the Internet Portfolio�s investment objective. 
�


���
Liquidity Risks: The Investment Adviser may not be able to sell portfolio securities at an optimal time or price. 
�


���
Industry Risks: Mutual funds that invest a substantial portion of their assets in a particular industry carry a risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to industry specific developments. Companies in the same or similar industries may share common characteristics and are more likely to react comparably to industry specific market or economic developments.
�


���
Internet Industry Specific Risks: Companies that conduct business on the Internet or derive a substantial portion of their revenues from Internet-related activities in general are subject to a rate of change in technology and competition which is generally higher than that of other industries.
�


���
Small and Medium-Size Company Risks: The Internet Portfolio may invest in the equity securities of small, medium and large-size companies. Small and medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than do larger, more established companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the volatility of the Internet Portfolio�s assets.
�


���
Foreign Securities Risks: The Internet Portfolio may invest in foreign securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with investment in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.
�



�

�
�3
�






�


���
Non-Diversification Risks: As a non-diversified investment company, more of the Internet Portfolio�s assets may be concentrated in the common stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Internet Portfolio�s shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a diversified mutual fund.
�


���
Option Transaction Risks: The Internet Portfolio may write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying asset.
�


���
Below-Investment Grade Debt Securities Risks: Generally, non-investment grade debt securities, i.e., junk bonds, are subject to greater credit risk, price volatility and risk of loss than investment grade securities.

�
Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Paradigm Portfolio is long-term growth of capital.
�
Principal Investment Strategies
The Paradigm Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances, at least 65% of its net assets in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs, of U.S. and foreign companies. The Paradigm Portfolio will invest in companies that the Investment Adviser believes are undervalued and that have high returns on equity and are well positioned to reduce their costs, extend the reach of their distribution channels and experience significant growth in their assets or revenues. A fundamental principle is to regard the investments as representing fractional ownership in the underlying companies� assets. The driver of appreciation for the classic value investor is a high return on equity, an intrinsic characteristic of the investment, not a reappraisal of the stock�s worth by the market, an external factor.
The Paradigm Portfolio may also write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment.

Paradigm Portfolio securities will be selected by the Investment Adviser from companies that are engaged in various industries that will facilitate an increase in the growth of traditional business lines, entry into new distribution channels, an ability to leverage brand identity, and an improvement in the underlying cost/profitability dynamics of the business. These companies may be large, medium or small in size if, in the Investment Adviser�s opinion, these companies meet the Paradigm Portfolio�s investment criteria. Accordingly, the Paradigm Portfolio seeks to invest in the equity securities of companies whose research and development efforts may result in higher stock values. Such companies include, but are not limited to, the following:
�


���
Retailers: Companies that sell retail products and services through traditional stores, catalogues, telemarketing, and web-sites.

Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Medical Portfolio is long-term growth of capital.

Principal Investment Strategies
The Medical Portfolio seeks to achieve it�s investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of it�s net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in common stocks, convertible securities, warrants and other equity securities having the characteristics of common stocks, such as ADRs and IDRs, of U.S. and foreign companies engaged generally in the medical research, pharmaceutical and technology industries and related medical technology industries with an emphasis toward companies engaged in cancer research and drug development.

Accordingly, the Medical Portfolio seeks to invest in the equity securities of companies whose research and development efforts may result in higher stock values. 
�
Medical Portfolio securities will be selected from companies that are engaged in the medical industry generally, including companies engaged in cancer research and treatment, biopharmaceutical research and the development of medical instruments for therapeutic purposes. These companies may be large, medium or small in size if in the Investment Adviser�s opinion, the companies meet the Medical Portfolio�s investment criteria. Such companies include, but are not limited to the following:
�


���
Pharmaceutical Development: Companies that develop drugs and medications for the treatment and prevention of cancer and other disease. 
�


���
Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturers and Developers: Companies that produce, manufacture and develop the tools used by health care providers in the delivery of medical care and procedures for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

�


���
Biotech & Medical Research: Companies that primarily research and develop new methods and procedures in the provision of health care related services for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. 
�
The Investment Adviser selects portfolio securities by evaluating a company�s positioning and the resources that it currently expends on research and development looking for a significant percentage, or large amount, of capital invested into research and treatment of cancer and other diseases. The Investment Adviser also considers a company�s fundamentals by reviewing its balance sheets, corporate revenues, earnings and dividends. The Investment Adviser also looks at the amount of capital a company spends on research and development because the Investment Adviser believes that such expenditures frequently have significant bearing on future growth.

Principal Risks of Investment
Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money. The principal risks of investing in the Medical Portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of the Medical Portfolio and your investment.
�


���
Stock Market Risks: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in value, the Medical Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment. 
�


���
Stock Selection Risks: The stocks selected by the Investment Adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the Medical Portfolio�s investment objective.
�


���
Liquidity Risks: The Investment Adviser may not be able to sell portfolio securities at an optimal time or price.
�


���
Industry Risks: Mutual funds that invest a substantial portion of their assets in a particular industry carry a risk that a group of industry-related stocks will decline in price due to industry-specific developments. Companies in the same or similar industries may share common characteristics and are more likely to react to industry-specific market or economic developments.
�


���
Specific Risks of the Medical Industry: Medical and pharmaceutical-related companies in general are subject to the rate of change in technology, which is generally higher than that of other industries. Similarly, cancer research-related industries use many products and services of companies engaged in the medical and pharmaceutical related activities and are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances. Further, the medical research and development industry is subject to strict regulatory scrutiny and ongoing legislative action.
�


���
Small and Medium-Size Company Risks: The Medical Portfolio may invest in the stocks of small, medium and large-size companies. Small and medium-size companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more established companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the volatility of the Medical Portfolio�s assets.
�


���
Foreign Securities Risks: The Medical Portfolio may invest in foreign securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks include currency fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.
�


���
Non-Diversification Risks: As a non-diversified investment company, more of the Medical Portfolio�s assets may be concentrated in the common stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Medical Portfolio�s shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a more diversified mutual fund.

Option Transaction Risks: The Medical Portfolio may write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying asset.
�

Below-Investment Grade Debt Securities Risks: Generally, non-investment grade debt securities, i.e., junk bonds, are subject to greater credit risk, price volatility and risk of loss than investment grade securities.

The Small Cap Portfolio may invest up to 20% of its assets in these securities to maintain liquidity. Some of these short-term money market instruments include:
�


���
commercial paper
�


���
certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits and banker�s acceptances
�


���
U.S. Government securities (i.e., U.S. Treasury obligations)
�


���
repurchase agreements
�
To the extent that the Small Cap Portfolio engages in this temporary, defensive strategy, the Small Cap Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective.

Principal Risks of Investment
Investing in common stocks has inherent risks that could cause you to lose money. The principal risks of investing in the Small Cap Portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of the Small Cap Portfolio and your investment.
�


���
Stock Market Risks: Stock mutual funds are subject to stock market risks and significant fluctuations in value. If the stock market declines in value, the Small Cap Portfolio is likely to decline in value and you could lose money on your investment.
�


���
Stock Selection Risks: The portfolio securities selected by the Investment Adviser may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising and may fail to meet the Small Cap Portfolio�s investment objective.
�


���
Liquidity Risks: The Investment Adviser may not be able to sell portfolio securities at an optimal time or price.
 
�


���
Small Company Risks: The Small Cap Portfolio primarily invests in the stocks of small-sized companies. Small-sized companies often have narrower markets and more limited managerial and financial resources than larger, more established companies. As a result, their performance can be more volatile and they face a greater risk of business failure, which could increase the volatility of the Small Cap Portfolio�s assets.
�
 


���
Foreign Securities Risks: The Small Cap Portfolio may invest in foreign securities, which can carry higher returns but involve more risks than those associated with U.S. investments. Additional risks associated with investing in foreign securities include currency fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.
�


���
Non-Diversification Risks: As a non-diversified investment company, more of the Small Cap Portfolio�s assets may be concentrated in the common stock of any single issuer, which may make the value of the Small Cap Portfolio�s shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a more diversified mutual fund.
�


���
Option Transaction Risks: The Small Cap Portfolio may write and sell options on securities in which it invests for hedging purposes and/or direct investment. Options contain certain special risks including the imperfect correlation between the value of the option and the value of the underlying asset.
�


���
Below-Investment Grade Debt Securities Risks: Generally, non-investment grade debt securities, i.e., junk bonds, are subject to greater credit risk, price volatility and risk of loss than investment grade securities.

Investment Objective, Principal Investment Strategies and Principal Risks of the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio
�
Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Government Money Market Portfolio is to provide current income consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity.
�
Principal Investment Strategies
The Government Money Market Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated short-term obligations that have been determined by the Investment Adviser, subject to the approval of the Portfolio�s Board of Trustees, to present minimal credit risk. The Portfolio does not invest in obligations with maturities of more than 397 days (subject to certain exceptions) and the average maturity of all obligations held by the Portfolio must be 90 days or less. The t Portfolio invests exclusively in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by such obligations (�U.S. Government Securities�). U.S. Government Securities include direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, such as Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds. The Portfolio
seeks to maintain a constant $1.00 net asset value per share.
�
U.S. Government Securities are high quality instruments guaranteed as to principal and interest and issued by the U.S. Treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government. Not all U.S. Government Securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury; others are backed by the discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase the agencies� obligations; while others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality. In the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, the Portfolio must look principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment.
�
Yields on short-, intermediate- and long-term U.S. Government Securities are dependent on a variety of factors, including the general conditions of the money and bond markets, the size of a particular offering and the maturity of the obligation. Debt securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher capital appreciation and depreciation than do obligations with shorter maturities and lower yields. The market value of U.S. Government Securities generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates. An increase in interest rates, therefore, generally would reduce the market value of the Portfolio�s investments in U.S. Government Securities, while a decline in interest rates generally would increase the market value of the Portfolio�s investments in these securities.
�
Under a repurchase agreement, the Portfolio purchases a U.S. Government Security and simultaneously agrees to sell the security back to the seller at a mutually agreed-upon future price and date, normally one day or a few days later. The resale price is greater than the purchase price, reflecting an agreed-upon market interest rate premium during the Portfolio�s holding period. While the maturities of the underlying securities in repurchase agreement transactions may be more than one year, the term of each repurchase agreement will always be less than one year. The Portfolio may enter into repurchase agreements with banks that are members of Federal Reserve System or securities dealers who are members of a national securities exchange or are primary dealers in U.S. Government Securities. The Investment Adviser monitors the creditworthiness of each firm that is a party to a repurchase agreement with the Portfolio.
�
Principal Risks of Investment
The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio are listed below and could adversely affect the net asset value, total return and value of the Portfolio and your investment.
�


���
Interest Rate Risks: The rate of income will vary from day to day depending on short-term interest rates. It is possible that a major change in interest rates could cause the value of your investment to decline. The values of the obligations held by the Portfolio can be expected to vary inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates. Although the investment policies of the Portfolio are designed to minimize these changes and to maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share, there is no assurance that these policies will be successful.
�



�

�
14�
�






�


���
Credit Risks: Changes in the credit quality rating or changes in an issuer�s financial condition can also affect the Portfolio. A default on a security held, or a repurchase agreement entered into, by the Portfolio could cause the value of your investment in the Portfolio to decline.
 
�


���
Repurchase Agreement Risks: One of the risks of investing in repurchase agreements is that the seller may not repurchase the securities from the Portfolio, which may result in the Portfolio selling the securities for less than the price agreed upon with the seller. Another risk of repurchase agreements is that the seller may default or file for bankruptcy. Under such circumstances, the Portfolio will liquidate those securities held under the repurchase agreement, which securities constitute collateral for the seller�s obligation to repurchase the securities, although the Portfolio might have to wait through lengthy court actions before selling the securities.

Main Risks of the Portfolios
�
The principal risks of investing in each Portfolio are described previously in this Prospectus. The following section provides more detail about some of those risks, along with information on additional types of risks that may apply to the Portfolios.
�
Investing in Mutual Funds�All Portfolios 
All mutual funds carry risks that may cause you to lose money on your investment in one or more of the Portfolios. The following describes the primary risks to each Portfolio based on each Portfolio�s specific investment objective and strategies. As all investment securities are subject to inherent market risks and fluctuations in value due to earnings, economic and political conditions and other factors, no Portfolio can give assurance that its investment objective will be achieved. 
�
Portfolio Turnover Rate Risk � All Portfolios 
Under certain circumstances a Portfolio may take advantage of short-term trading opportunities without regard to the length of time its securities have been held. This strategy often calls for frequent trading of a Portfolio�s securities in order to take advantage of anticipated changes in market conditions. Frequent trading by the Portfolio could increase the rate of its portfolio turnover, which would involve correspondingly greater expenses. Such expenses may include brokerage commissions or dealer mark-ups/mark-downs, as well as other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities. Such sales also may result in adverse tax consequences to shareholders. If a Portfolio realizes capital gains when it sells its portfolio investments, it must generally pay those gains out to shareholders, increasing their taxable distributions. The trading costs and tax effects associated with such portfolio
turnover may adversely affect Portfolio performance under these circumstances, and large movements of assets into and out of a Portfolio may negatively impact such Portfolio�s ability to achieve its investment objective or current level of operating expenses. 
�
Market Risk�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
The net asset value of each Portfolio will fluctuate based on changes in the value of its underlying portfolio. The stock market is generally susceptible to volatile fluctuations in market price. Market prices of securities in which each Portfolio invests may be adversely affected by an issuer�s having experienced losses or by the lack of earnings or by the issuer�s failure to meet the market�s expectations with respect to new products or services, or even by factors wholly unrelated to the value or condition of the issuer. The value of the securities held by the Portfolios is also subject to the risk that a specific segment of the stock market does not perform as well as the overall market. Under any of these circumstances, the value of each Portfolio�s shares and total return will fluctuate, and your investment may be worth more or less than your original cost when you redeem your shares.
�
Internet Industry Specific Risks�The Internet Portfolio and the Emerging Growth Portfolio
The value of each Portfolio�s shares will be susceptible to factors affecting the Internet, such as heightened regulatory scrutiny and impending changes in government policies which may have a material effect on the products and services of this industry. Furthermore, securities of companies in this industry tend to be more volatile than securities of companies in other industries. Competitive pressures and changing demand may have a significant effect on the financial condition of Internet companies. These companies spend heavily on research and development and are especially sensitive to the risk of product obsolescence. The occurrence of any of these factors, individually or collectively, may adversely affect the value of a Portfolio�s shares. 
�



�

�
16�
�






�
�
Medical Research Industry-Specific Risks�The Medical Portfolio
Medical and pharmaceutical-related companies in general are subject to the rate of change in technology, which is generally higher than that of other industries. Similarly, cancer research-related industries use many products and services of companies engaged in medical and pharmaceutical-related activities and are also subject to relatively high risks of rapid obsolescence caused by progressive scientific and technological advances. Medical research and development is also subject to strict regulatory scrutiny and ongoing legislative action. 
�
Securities Lending�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Each Portfolio may lend its portfolio securities to broker-dealers by entering directly into lending arrangements with such broker-dealers, amounting to no more than 33 1/3% of the total assets of each Portfolio (including any collateral posted) or 50% of the total assets of each Portfolio (excluding any collateral posted). Repurchase transactions will be fully collateralized at all times with cash and/or short-term debt obligations. These transactions involve some risk to a Portfolio if the other party should default on its obligation and the Portfolio is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral. In the event that the original seller defaults on its obligation to repurchase, a Portfolio will seek to sell the collateral, which could involve costs or delays. To the extent proceeds from the sale of collateral are less than the repurchase price, each Portfolio forced to sell
such collateral in this manner would suffer a loss.
 
�
Non-Diversification�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Each Portfolio is classified as �non-diversified� under federal securities laws which means that one-half of each Portfolio�s assets may be invested in the stocks of two or more issuers not exceeding 25% of a Portfolio�s total assets with respect to any one issuer while the other half is spread out among investments of various issuers generally not exceeding with respect to any issuer 5% of a Portfolio�s total assets. As a result of its non-diversified status, a Portfolio�s shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the value of the securities of a particular company than would be the shares of a diversified investment company.
�
 
Investment in Small and Medium-Size Companies�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Each Portfolio may invest in small or medium-size companies. Accordingly, a Portfolio may be subject to the additional risks associated with investment in companies with small or medium-size capital structures (generally a market capitalization of $5 billion or less). The market prices of the securities of such companies tend to be more volatile than those of larger companies. Further, these securities tend to trade at a lower volume than those of larger, more established companies. If a Portfolio is heavily invested in these securities and the value of these securities suddenly declines, the net asset value of the Portfolio will be more susceptible to significant losses. 
�
Foreign Securities�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Investing in foreign securities can carry higher returns than those generally associated with U.S. investments. However, foreign securities may be substantially riskier than U.S. investments. The economies of foreign countries may differ from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, and balance of payments position. Furthermore, the economies of developing countries generally are heavily dependent on international trade and, accordingly, have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protective measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These economies also have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. A Portfolio
may be required to obtain prior governmental approval for foreign investments in some countries under certain circumstances. Governments may require approval to invest in certain issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests, and the extent of foreign investment in certain debt securities and companies may be subject to limitation. Individual companies may also limit foreign ownership to prevent, among other things, violation of foreign investment limitations. 
�
Some foreign investments may risk being subject to repatriation controls that could render such securities illiquid. Other countries might undergo nationalization, expropriation, political changes, governmental regulation, social instability or diplomatic developments (including war) that could adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the investments in those countries. For this reason, Portfolios that invest primarily in the securities of a single country will be greatly impacted by any political, economic or regulatory developments affecting the value of the securities. Additional risks include currency fluctuations, political and economic instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets.

�
�
Portfolio Borrowing�All Portfolios
Each Portfolio may leverage up to 5% of its assets to Portfolio investment activities or to achieve higher returns. Each Portfolio may borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes in order to meet redemption requests. To reduce its indebtedness, a Portfolio may have to sell a portion of its investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, interest paid by a Portfolio on borrowed funds would decrease the net earnings of the Portfolio.
�
Derivatives Risk�All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Each Portfolio may invest in derivatives such as options and futures. The successful use of these investment practices depends on the portfolio manager's ability to forecast stock price movements and/or currency exchange rate movements correctly. Should stock prices or exchange rates move unexpectedly, a Portfolio may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions, or may realize losses, and thus be in a worse position than if such strategies had not been used. Unlike many exchange-traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts, there are no daily price fluctuation limits for certain options and forward contracts, and adverse market movements
could therefore continue to an unlimited extent over a period of time. In addition, the correlation between movements in the prices of futures contracts, options and forward contracts and movements in the prices of the securities and currencies hedged or used for cover will not be perfect and could produce unanticipated losses. 
�
A Portfolio�s ability to dispose of its positions in futures contracts, options, and forward contracts depends on the availability of liquid markets in such instruments. Markets in options and futures with respect to a number of types of securities and currencies are relatively new and still developing, and there is no public market for forward contracts. It is impossible to predict the amount of trading interest that may exist in various types of futures contracts, options, and forward contracts.
If a secondary market does not exist for an option purchased or written by a Portfolio, it might not be possible to effect a closing transaction in the option (i.e., dispose of the option), with the result that (1) an option purchased by a Portfolio would have to be exercised in order for the Portfolio to realize any profit and (2) a Portfolio may not be able to sell currencies or portfolio securities covering an option written by the Portfolio until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security, futures contract or currency upon exercise. Therefore, no assurance can be given that the Portfolios will be able to utilize these instruments effectively. In addition, a Portfolio's ability to engage in options and futures transactions may be limited by tax considerations and the use of certain hedging techniques may adversely impact the characterization of income to the
Portfolio for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
�
Investing in Investment Grade Debt Securities and Below Investment Grade Debt Securities� All Portfolios other than the Government Money Market Portfolio
Investments in debt securities pose different risks. The value of fixed income securities generally will fall if interest rates rise. The value of these securities may also fall as a result of other factors such as the performance of the issuer, the market perception of the issuer or general economic conditions. These investments also involve a risk that the issuer may not be able to meet its principal and interest payment obligations. Fixed income securities having longer maturities involve greater risk of fluctuations in value.
�
Investments in debt securities rated below investment grade, i.e., junk bonds, and unrated securities of comparable quality are subject to the increased risk of an issuer�s inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations. These securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific corporate or municipal developments, interest rate sensitivity, negative perceptions of the junk bond markets generally and less secondary market liquidity.

Management of the Portfolios
�
Investment Adviser
Each Portfolio�s investment adviser is Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (�Investment Adviser�), 16 New Broadway, Sleepy Hollow, New York 10591. Founded in 1996, the Investment Adviser provides investment advisory services to a family of six mutual funds with discretionary management authority over approximately $730 million in assets at December 31, 2004. The Investment Adviser conducts investment research and supervision for each Portfolio and is responsible for the purchase and sale of securities for each Portfolio. The Investment Adviser is entitled to receive an annual fee from each Portfolio
for its services of 1.25% (or 0.50% in the case of the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio) of each Portfolio�s average daily net assets. However, as a result of certain waivers for the Funds, the advisory fees paid to the Investment Adviser for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, were as follows:

The Statement of Additional Information provides additional information about the portfolio managers� compensation, other accounts managed by the portfolio managers, and the portfolio managers� ownership of securities in the Fund.
�
Valuation of the Portfolios�
�
Each Portfolio, other than the Government Money Market Portfolio, calculates its net asset value (�NAV�) as of the close of regular trading (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), on each day that the New York Stock Exchange (the �Exchange�) is open for unrestricted business. In the case of the Government Money Market Portfolio, the NAV is determined as of 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on each day that the Exchange is open for unrestricted business. Each Portfolio�s securities (other than those of the Government Money Market Portfolio) are valued each day at the last quoted market price on the securities principal exchange. If market quotations are not readily available or if events occur that may materially affect the value of a particular security between the time trading ends on a particular security and the close of regular trading on the Exchange, securities will be valued at their fair market value as determined in
good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Each Portfolio other than the Government Money Market Portfolio may use independent pricing services to assist in calculating the NAV of such Portfolio.
�
Attempts to determine the fair value of securities introduce an element of subjectivity to the pricing of securities. As a result, the price of a security determined through fair valuation techniques may differ from the price quoted or published by other sources and may not accurately reflect the market value of the security when trading resumes. 

The Government Money Market Portfolio will utilize the amortized cost method in valuing its portfolio securities. This method involves valuing a security at its cost adjusted by a constant amortization of maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument. The purpose of this method of calculation is to facilitate the maintenance of a consistent net asset value per share for the Government Money Market Portfolio of $1.00. However, there is no assurance that the $1.00 net asset value per share will be maintained. 
 
�
Attempts to determine the fair value of securities introduce an element of subjectivity to the pricing of securities. As a result, the price of a security determined through fair valuation techniques may differ from the price quoted or published by other sources and may not accurately reflect the market value of the security when trading resumes. If a reliable market quotation becomes available for a security formerly valued through fair valuation techniques, the Adviser compares the new market quotation to the fair value price to evaluate the effectiveness of the Portfolios� fair valuation procedures.

�
Trading in Foreign Securities
Trading in foreign securities may be completed at times when the Exchange is closed. In computing the NAV of each Portfolio that trades foreign securities, the value of a foreign security is determined as of the close of trading on the foreign exchange on which it is principally traded or as of the scheduled close of trading on the Exchange, whichever is earlier, at the closing sales price as provided by the approved pricing services or other alternate sources. In the absence of sales, the last available mean price between the closing bid and asked prices will be used. Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees. Values of foreign securities are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars on the bases of the foreign currency exchange rates, as provided by an independent pricing service
or reporting agency, generally prior to the close of the Exchange. Occasionally, events affecting the value of foreign securities and such exchange rates occur between the time at which they are determined and the close of the Exchange, which events would not be reflected in the computation of a Portfolio�s net asset value. Situations involving significant events include, but are not limited to, if a security�s trading has been halted or suspended; the security has been de-listed from a national exchange; or the security has not been traded for an extended period of time. In addition, the prices of foreign securities may be affected by events that occur after the close of a foreign market but before the Portfolio prices its shares. If events materially affecting the value of such securities or currency exchange rates occur during such time period, the securities will be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees.

Purchase of Beneficial Interests in the Portfolios
Beneficial interests in each of the Portfolios are sold without a sales load, at the NAV next determined after an order is received by a Portfolio. Investments in a Portfolio are sold solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any �public offering� within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the Portfolio may be made only by regulated investment companies, unregulated foreign investment companies, U.S. and non-U.S. institutional investors, S corporations, segregated asset accounts, insurance company separate accounts, and certain qualified pension and retirement plans. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any �security� within the meaning of the 1933 Act.

There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in the Portfolios. Each Portfolio reserves the right to cease accepting investments at any time or to reject any investment order.
�
Redemption of Beneficial Interests in the Portfolios
�
An investor in a Portfolio may redeem all or any portion of its investment at the NAV next determined after a redemption request in good order is received by such Portfolio. The proceeds of a redemption will be paid by the Portfolio in federal funds normally on the Business Day that the redemption is effected, but in any event within three business days, except as extensions may be permitted by law.
�
Each Portfolio reserves the right to pay the redemption price of a beneficial interest in kind, i.e. in readily marketable securities. Unless requested by an investor or deemed by the Investment Adviser to be in the best interests of the investors in a Portfolio as a group, the Portfolio will not pay a redemption in kind to an investor, except in situations where that investor may pay redemptions in kind.
�
The right of any investor to receive payment with respect to any redemption may be suspended, or the payment of the redemption proceeds postponed, during any period in which the NYSE is closed or trading on the NYSE is restricted or to the extent otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act.

Exchange Privilege
You can exchange your interest in a Portfolio for an interest in any other Portfolio offered by the Trust at no charge. You should carefully read the prospectus of a Portfolio before exchanging into that Portfolio. Be advised that exercising the exchange privilege consists of two transactions: a withdrawal of interest in one Portfolio and the contribution of interest in another. You should request your exchange prior to market close to obtain that day�s closing NAV. Exchange requests received after the close of the Exchange will be treated as though received on the next business day.
�
Restrictions on Excessive Trading Practices
The Portfolios are designed for long-term investors willing to accept the risks associated with a long-term investment. The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted policies and procedures with respect to frequent trading of Portfolio shares by shareholders. 

Frequent purchases and redemptions of Portfolio shares are not encouraged but are generally permitted by the Portfolios. Such purchases and redemptions may have an adverse affect on other Portfolio shareholders, including without limitation, possibility of disrupting portfolio management strategies, increasing brokerage and administrative costs, harming fund performance and resulting in dilution in the value of Portfolio shares held by long-term shareholders. The Trust may, in its sole discretion, reject purchase orders when, in the judgment of management, such rejection is in the best interest of the Portfolio and its shareholders.

Taxes
�
None of the Portfolios are required to pay federal income taxes on their ordinary income and capital gains because each Portfolio is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. All interest, dividends and gains and losses of a Portfolio are deemed to "pass through" to its partners, regardless whether any such interest, dividends or gains are distributed by the Portfolio. Each partner in a Portfolio will be allocated a share (as determined in accordance with the Trust's Declaration of Trust, the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and regulations thereunder) of the Portfolio's items of income, gain, loss and deduction. The Trust will inform partners of each Portfolio of the amount and nature of such tax items each year.
�
The foregoing discussion relates only to federal income tax law. Income from a Portfolio also may be subject to foreign, state and local taxes, and the treatment under foreign, state and local income tax laws may differ from the federal income tax treatment. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to particular questions of federal, foreign, state and local taxation.
�
Distribution of Shares
�
Private Placement Agent
Kinetics Funds Distributor, Inc. (�KFDI�), serves as the private placement agent for the shares of beneficial interest of the Portfolios on a best efforts basis. KFDI is a registered broker-dealer and member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Beneficial interests in the Portfolios are issued continuously.

General Information about Kinetics Portfolio Trust
�
Kinetics Portfolios Trust (the �Trust�) is a statutory trust organized pursuant to a Declaration of Trust under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 14, 2000. The Trust�s principal business office is located at 16 New Broadway, Sleepy Hollow, New York 10591. The Trust is comprised of several series of mutual funds, all of which are non-diversified (except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio), open-end management investment companies. Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc. (the �Company�) is a Maryland corporation, established on March 26,
1999. The Company is comprised of several series of mutual funds, all of which are open-end investment companies (the �Funds�). The Funds and Portfolios are set up in a master/feeder fund structure whereby each Fund is a feeder fund that invests all of its investable assets in a corresponding �master� Portfolio. The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio is a no-load, diversified investment company. Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (�Kinetics� or the �Adviser�) is a New York corporation that serves as the investment adviser to the Portfolios. 

 
Capitalization

The authorized capitalization of Kinetics Portfolios Trust consists of an unlimited number of beneficial interests. Each investor in a Portfolio is entitled to participate equally in the Portfolio�s earnings and assets. 

Each investor in a Portfolio is entitled to vote in proportion to the amount of its investment in the Portfolio. Portfolio investors will vote together in certain circumstances (e.g., election of the Trustees and ratification of auditors, as required by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder). One or more Portfolios could control the outcome of these votes. Investors do not have cumulative voting rights, and investors holding more than 50% of the aggregate beneficial interests in the Trust or in a Portfolio, as the case may be, may control the outcome of votes. The Trust is not required and has no current intention to hold annual meetings of investors, but the Trust will hold special meetings of investors when (1) a majority of the Trustees determines to do so or (2) investors holding at least 10% of the interests in a Portfolio (if the meeting relates solely to that Portfolio), or investors holding at least 10% of the aggregate
interests in the Trust (if the meeting relates to the Trust and not specifically to a Portfolio) requests in writing a meeting of investors. Changes in fundamental policies or limitations will be submitted to investors for approval.

The Trust is organized as a business trust under the laws of the State of Delaware. Investors in a Portfolio will be held personally liable for its obligations and liabilities, subject, however, to indemnification by the Trust in the event that there is imposed upon an investor a greater portion of the liabilities and obligations than its proportionate beneficial interest in the Portfolio. The Declaration of Trust also provides that, subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Trust may maintain insurance (for example, fidelity bonding and errors and omissions insurance) for the protection of the Portfolios, investors, Trustees, officers, employees, and agents covering possible tort and other liabilities. Thus, the risk of an investor incurring financial loss on account of such liability would be limited to circumstances in which a Portfolio had inadequate insurance and was unable to meet its obligation out of its assets.

The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio
 

The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio is a diversified portfolio with a primary investment objective of providing current income consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity. The Portfolio invests primarily in money market instruments issued or guaranteed, as to principal and interest, by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the provisions and regulations of the 1940 Act. In particular, the Portfolio will comply with the various requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act, which regulates money market mutual funds. The Portfolio will also determine the effective maturity of its investments, as well as its ability to consider a security as having received the requisite short-term ratings
by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) according to Rule 2a-7. The Portfolio may change these operational policies to reflect changes in the laws and regulations without the approval of shareholders.

�


9.��
The Small Capital Opportunities Portfolio will not invest in the securities of any one industry, with the exception of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, and instrumentalities, if as a result, more than 20% of the Portfolio�s total net assets would be invested in the securities of such industry.

With respect to Investment Limitations No. 7 and No. 9 above, utility companies will be divided according to their services; for example, gas, electric and telephone will each be considered a separate industry. If a percentage limitation is satisfied at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in such percentage resulting from a change in value in the portfolio securities held by a Portfolio will not constitute a violation of such limitation. 

Adherence by the Kinetics Government Money Market Fund/Portfolio to the diversification requirements of Rule 2a-7 is deemed to constitute adherence to the diversification requirements of Investment Limitation No. 3 above.

Investment Policies and Associated Risks
�
The following paragraphs provide a more detailed description of the Portfolios� investment policies and risks identified in the Prospectus. Unless otherwise noted, the policies described in this SAI pertain to all of the Portfolios other than the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio. Furthermore, unless otherwise noted, the policies described in this SAI are not fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees of the Trust without shareholder approval.
 
�
Common and Preferred Stock; Convertible Securities

 
Common stocks are units of ownership of a corporation. Preferred stocks are stocks that often pay dividends at a specific rate and have a preference over common stocks in dividend payments and liquidation of assets. Some preferred stocks may be convertible into common stock. Convertible securities are securities that may be converted into or exchanged for a specified amount of common stock of the same or different issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price or formula.




�

�
4�
�






�
�
Debt Securities

The Portfolios (other than the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio) may invest in convertible and non-convertible debt obligations without regard to rating, and as a result, may purchase or hold securities in the lowest rating categories. Debt securities in the lowest investment grade categories are considered to be below investment grade securities that may not have adequate capacity to pay principal or that otherwise generally lack the characteristics of desirable investments. As compared to debt securities with higher ratings, these �high risk� securities are vulnerable to nonpayment and depend to a larger degree upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. At no time will the Portfolios have more than 20% of their respective
total assets invested in any debt securities that are rated below investment grade or if the security is unrated, of comparable quality as determined by a Portfolio�s Adviser, either at the time of purchase or as a result of a reduction in rating after purchase. Please see �Appendix� to this Statement of Additional Information for a description of debt security ratings.
�
When-Issued and Delayed Delivery Transactions

The Portfolios (including the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio) may purchase short-term obligations on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions are arrangements in which the Portfolios purchase securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a future time. The seller�s failure to complete these transactions may cause the Portfolios to miss a price or yield considered advantageous. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices.

The Portfolios may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the Adviser deems it appropriate to do so. In addition, each Portfolio may enter into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later dates. A Portfolio may realize short-term profits or losses upon the sale of such commitments.

These transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for a Portfolio. No fees or other expenses, other than normal transaction costs, are incurred. However, liquid assets of the Portfolio sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the Portfolio�s records at the trade date. These assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction is settled. The Portfolios do not intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20% of the total value of their assets.
�
Repurchase Agreements 

The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio may invest in repurchase agreements which are arrangements with banks, broker/dealers, and other recognized financial institutions to sell securities to the Portfolio and to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price within one year from the date of acquisition. The Portfolio or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to the terms of the repurchase agreements, and these securities will be marked to market daily. To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the Portfolio, the Portfolio could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities. In the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent, disposition of such securities by the Portfolio might be delayed pending court action. The Portfolio believes
that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the Portfolio�s assets subject to repurchase agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the Portfolio and allow retention or disposition of such securities. The Portfolio will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed by the Portfolio�s Adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to guidelines established by the Board of Trustees.




�

�
�5
�






�
�
Other Money Market Funds 

As an efficient means of carrying out its investment policies, the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio may invest in the securities of other money market funds. A disadvantage to investing in other money market funds is that they also carry certain expenses such as management fees. As a result, any investment by the Portfolio in shares of other money market funds may duplicate certain shareholder expenses.
�
Restricted and Illiquid Securities

Each Portfolio�may invest in a limited amount of restricted securities. Restricted securities are any securities in which the Portfolios may invest pursuant to their investment objective and policies but which are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities laws. An illiquid asset is any asset which may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the value at which the Portfolio has valued the investment.
�
Fixed-Income Securities

The fixed-income securities in which the Portfolios may invest are generally subject to two kinds of risk: credit risk and market risk. 

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal payments, as they become due. The ratings given a security by Moody�s and S&P provide a generally useful guide as to such credit risk. The lower the rating given a security by such rating service, the greater the credit risk such rating service perceives to exist with respect to such security. Increasing the amount of Portfolio assets invested in unrated or lower-grade securities, while intended to increase the yield produced by those assets, will also increase the credit risk to which those assets are subject.

Market Risk. All mutual funds are affected by changes in the economy and swings in investment markets. These can occur within or outside the U.S. or worldwide, and may affect only particular companies or industries.

Depositary Receipts. The Portfolios may invest in American Depositary Receipts (�ADRs�) or other forms of depositary receipts, such as International Depositary Receipts (�IDRs�). Depositary receipts are typically issued in connection with a U.S. or foreign bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. Investments in these types of securities involve certain inherent risks generally associated with investments in foreign securities, including the following:

Political and Economic Factors. Individual foreign economies of certain countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States economy in such respects as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, diversification and balance of payments position. The internal politics of certain foreign countries may not be as stable as those of the United States. Governments in certain foreign countries also continue to participate to a significant degree, through ownership interest or regulation, in their respective economies. Action by these governments could include restrictions on foreign investment, nationalization, expropriation of goods or imposition of taxes, and could have a significant effect on market prices of securities and payment of interest. The economies of
many foreign countries are heavily dependent upon international trade and are accordingly affected by the trade policies and economic conditions of their trading partners. Enactment by these trading partners of protectionist trade legislation could have a significant adverse effect upon the securities markets of such countries.
�



�

�
�6
�






�
Currency Fluctuations. A change in the value of any foreign currency against the U.S. dollar will result in a corresponding change in the U.S. dollar value of an ADR�s underlying portfolio securities denominated in that currency. Such changes will affect a Portfolio to the extent that the Portfolio is invested in ADRs comprised of foreign securities.

Taxes. The interest and dividends payable on certain foreign securities comprising an ADR may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, thus reducing the net amount of income to be paid to the Portfolios and that may ultimately be available for distribution to the Portfolio�s shareholders.
�
Derivatives

Buying Call and Put Options. The Portfolios, except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, may purchase call options. Such transactions may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price of the security that each Portfolio intends to purchase. Prior to its expiration, a call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction. Any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction cost.

The Portfolios may purchase put options. By buying a put, each Portfolio has the right to sell the security at the exercise price, thus limiting its risk of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put expires. The amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction cost. Prior to its expiration, a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs.

Writing (Selling) Call and Put Options. Each Portfolio, except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, may write covered options on equity and debt securities and indices. This means that, in the case of call options, so long as each Portfolio is obligated as the writer of a call option, it will own the underlying security subject to the option and, in the case of put options, it will, through its custodian, deposit and maintain either cash or securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option.
 

Covered call options written by a Portfolio give the holder the right to buy the underlying securities from the Portfolio at a stated exercise price. A call option written by a Portfolio is �covered� if the Portfolios owns the underlying security that is subject to the call or have an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration (or for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian bank) upon conversion or exchange of other securities held in its portfolio. A call option is also covered if a Portfolio holds a call on the same security and in the same principal amount as the call written where the exercise price of the call held (a)�is equal to or less than the exercise price of the call written or (b)�is greater than the exercise price of the call written if the difference is maintained by the Portfolio in cash and high grade debt securities in
a segregated account with their custodian bank. The Portfolios may purchase securities, which may be covered with call options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Portfolios. A Portfolio�s turnover may increase through the exercise of a call option; this will generally occur if the market value of a �covered� security increases and the Portfolio has not entered in to a closing purchase transaction.

 
As a writer of an option, each Portfolio receives a premium less a commission, and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price. The premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security. The premium paid by the buyer of an option will reflect, among other things, the relationship of the exercise price to the market price, the volatility of the underlying security, the remaining term of the option, the existing supply and demand, and the interest rates. 




�

�
�7
�






�
The writer of a call option may have no control over when the underlying securities must be sold because the writer may be assigned an exercise notice at any time prior to the termination of the obligation. Exercise of a call option by the purchaser will cause a Portfolio to forego future appreciation of the securities covered by the option. Whether or not an option expires unexercised, the writer retains the amount of the premium. This amount may, in the case of a covered call option, be offset by a decline in the market value of the underlying security during the option period. If a call option is exercised, the writer experiences a profit or loss from the sale of the underlying security. Thus during the option period, the writer of a call option gives up the opportunity for appreciation in the market value of the underlying security or currency above the exercise price. It retains the risk of the loss should the price of the
underlying security or foreign currency decline. Writing call options also involves risks relating to a Portfolio�s ability to close out the option it has written.

Each Portfolio may write exchange-traded call options on its securities. Call options may be written on portfolio securities indices, or foreign currencies. With respect to securities and foreign currencies, the Portfolio may write call and put options on an exchange or over-the-counter. Call options on portfolio securities will be covered since the Portfolio will own the underlying securities. Call options on securities indices will be written only to hedge in an economically appropriate way portfolio securities that are not otherwise hedged with options or financial futures contracts and will be �covered� by identifying the specific portfolio securities being hedged. Options on foreign currencies will be covered by securities denominated in that currency. Options on securities indices will be covered by securities that substantially
replicate the movement of the index.

A put option on a security, security index, or foreign currency gives the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid to the writer (seller), the right to sell the underlying security, index, or foreign currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period. When a Portfolio writes a secured put option, it will gain a profit in the amount of the premium, less a commission, so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the exercise price. However, a Portfolio remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the put option (usually in the event the price of the security falls bellows the exercise price) at any time during the option period. If the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise price, the Portfolios may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale price of the security, less the premium received.
Upon exercise by the purchaser, the writer of a put option has the obligation to purchase the underlying security or foreign currency at the exercise price. A put option on a securities index is similar to a put option on an individual security, except that the value of the option depends on the weighted value of the group of securities comprising the index and all settlements are made in cash.

During the option period, the writer of a put option has assumed the risk that the price of the underlying security or foreign currency will decline below the exercise price. However, the writer of the put option has retained the opportunity for an appreciated above the exercise price should the market price of the underlying security or foreign currency increase. Writing put options also involves risks relating to a Portfolio�s ability to close out the option that it has written.

The writer of an option who wishes to terminate its obligation may effect a �closing purchase transaction� by buying an option of the same series as the option previously written. The effect of the purchase is that the clearing corporation will cancel the writer�s position. However, a writer may not effect a closing purchase transaction after being notified of the exercise of an option. There is also no guarantee that a Portfolio will be able to effect a closing purchase transaction for the options it has written.

Effecting a closing purchase transaction in the case of a written call option will permit a Portfolio to write another call option on the underlying security with a different exercise price, expiration date, or both. Effecting a closing purchase transaction will also permit a Portfolio to use cash or proceeds from the investments. If a Portfolio desires to sell a particular security from its portfolio on which it has written a call option, it will effect a closing purchase transaction before or at the same time as the sale of the security.




�

�
8�
�






�
A Portfolio will realize a profit from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium received from writing the option. Likewise, a Portfolio will realize a loss from a closing purchase transaction if the price of the transaction is more than the premium received from writing the option. Because increases in the market price of a call option will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying security, any loss resulting from the repurchase of a call option is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying security owned by the Portfolio.

Writing Over-The-Counter (�OTC�) Options. Each Portfolio, except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, may engage in options transactions that trade on the OTC market to the same extent that it intends to engage in exchange-traded options. Just as with exchange-traded options, OTC options give the holder the right to buy an underlying security from, or sell an underlying security to, an option writer at a stated exercise price. However, OTC options differ from exchange-traded options in certain material respects.

OTC options are arranged directly with dealers and not, as is the case with exchange-traded options, through a clearing corporation. Thus, there is a risk of non-performance by the dealer. Because there is no exchange, pricing is typically done by reference to information obtained from market makers. Since OTC options are available for a greater variety of securities and in a wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices, the writer of an OTC option is paid the premium in advance by the dealer.

A writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it voluntarily only by entering into a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that a continuously liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option at any specific time. Consequently, a Portfolio may be able to realize the value of an OTC option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer that issued it. Similarly, when a Portfolio writes an OTC option, it generally can close out that option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which it originally wrote to option. If a covered call option writer cannot effect a closing transaction, it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign currency until the option expires or the option is exercised. Therefore, the writer of a covered OTC call option may not be able to sell an underlying security
even though it might otherwise be advantageous to do so. Likewise, the writer of a secured OTC put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged to secure the put for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put writer. Similarly, a purchaser of an OTC put or call option might also find it difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a secondary market.
 

The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�) has often taken the position that purchased OTC options and the assets used to �cover� written OTC options are illiquid securities. The Portfolios will adopt procedures for engaging in OTC options transactions for the purpose of reducing any potential adverse effect of such transactions on the liquidity of the Portfolios.

Futures Contracts. Each Portfolio, except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio,�may buy and sell stock index futures contracts traded on domestic stock exchanges to hedge the value of its portfolio against changes in market conditions. A stock index futures contract is an agreement between two parties to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to a specified dollar amount, times the difference between the stock index value at the close of the last trading day of the contract
and the price at which the futures contract is originally struck. A stock index futures contract does not involve the physical delivery of the underlying stocks in the index. Although stock index futures contracts call for the actual taking or delivery of cash, in most cases each Portfolio expects to liquidate its stock index futures positions through offsetting transactions, which may result in a gain or a loss, before cash settlement is required.

 
Each Portfolio will incur brokerage fees when it purchases and sells stock index futures contracts, and at the time a Portfolio purchases or sells a stock index futures contract, it must make a good faith deposit known as the �initial margin�. Thereafter, a Portfolio may need to make subsequent deposits, known as �variation margin�, to reflect changes in the level of the stock index. Each Portfolio may buy or sell a stock index futures contract so long as the sum of the amount of margin deposits on open positions with respect to all stock index futures contracts
does not exceed 5% of the Portfolio�s net assets.




�

�
�9
�






�
To the extent a Portfolio enters into a stock index futures contract, it will maintain with its custodian bank (to the extent required by the rules of the SEC) assets in a segregated account to cover its obligations. Such assets may consist of cash, cash equivalents, or high quality debt securities from its portfolio in an amount equal to the difference between the fluctuating market value of such futures contract and the aggregate value of the initial and variation margin payments.
 

Risks Associated With Options and Futures. Although each Portfolio, except the Government Money Market Portoflio, may write covered call options and purchase and sell stock index futures contracts to hedge against declines in market value of their portfolio securities, the use of these instruments involves certain risks. As the writer of covered call options, a Portfolio receives a premium but loses any opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying securities, though the premium received may partially offset such loss.

Although stock index futures contracts may be useful in hedging against adverse changes in the value of a Portfolio�s investment securities, they are derivative instruments that are subject to a number of risks. During certain market conditions, purchases and sales of stock index futures contracts may not completely offset a decline or rise in the value of a Portfolio�s investments. In the futures markets, it may not always be possible to execute a buy or sell order at the desired price, or to close out an open position due to market conditions, limits on open positions and/or daily price fluctuations. Changes in the market value of each Portfolio�s investment securities may differ substantially from the changes anticipated by the Portfolio when
it established its hedged positions, and unanticipated price movements in a futures contract may result in a loss substantially greater than the Portfolio�s initial investment in such a contract.

 
Successful use of futures contracts depends upon the Adviser�s ability to correctly predict movements in the securities markets generally or of a particular segment of a securities market. No assurance can be given that the Adviser�s judgment in this respect will be correct.

The CFTC and the various exchanges have established limits referred to as �speculative position limits� on the maximum net long or net short position that any person may hold or control in a particular futures contract. Trading limits are imposed on the number of contracts that any person may trade on a particular trading day. An exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in violation of these limits and it may impose sanctions or restrictions. These trading and positions limits will not have an adverse impact on a Portfolio�s strategies for hedging its securities. 

Distressed Investments 

Each Portfolio, other than the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, may invest up to 5% of its assets in securities of companies that are in financial distress (i.e. involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings). These securities may include, among other things, senior or subordinated fixed income securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants and other kinds of indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will correctly evaluate all the factors that could affect the outcome of an investment in these types of securities. Financially distressed securities involve considerable risk that can result in substantial or even total loss on a Portfolio�s investment. 

It is often difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of financially distressed securities. These securities are often subject to litigation among the participants in the proceedings for bankruptcy or reorganization. Such investments may also be adversely affected by federal and state laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent transfers and other voidable transfers or payments, lender liability and a bankruptcy court�s power to disallow, reduce, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. These and other factors contribute to above-average price volatility and abrupt and erratic movements of the market prices of these securities. In addition, the spread between the bid and asked prices of such securities may be greater than normally expected and it may take a number of years for the market price of such securities to reflect their intrinsic value.




�

�
10�
�






�
Securities of financially troubled companies require active monitoring and may, at times, require participation in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings by the Adviser. To the extent that the Adviser becomes involved in such proceedings, the Adviser may have a more active participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by a shareholder, and such participation may generate higher legal fees and other transaction costs relating to the investment than would normally be the case.

In bankruptcy and other forms of corporate reorganization, there exists the risk that the reorganization will: (1)�be unsuccessful (due to, for example, failure to obtain the necessary approvals); (2) be delayed (for example, until various liabilities, actual or contingent, have been satisfied); or (3) result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price of the security in respect to which such distribution was made.
�
Temporary Investments
�
Due to the changing nature of the Internet and related companies, the national economy and market conditions, the Internet Portfolio and the Internet Emerging Growth Portfolio may, as a temporary defensive measure, invest without limitation, in short-term debt securities and money market securities with a rating of A2-P2 or higher.

Due to the changing nature of the medical research, biopharmaceutical and treatment industry, the national economy and market conditions, the Medical Portfolio may, as a temporary defensive measure, invest without limitation, in short-term money market securities with a rating of A2-P2 or higher.

In order to have funds available for redemption and investment opportunities, the Portfolios, except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, may also hold a portion of their assets in cash or U.S. short-term money market instruments. Certificates of deposit purchased by the Portfolios will be those of U.S. banks having total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $1�billion, and bankers� acceptances purchased by the Portfolios will be guaranteed by U.S. or foreign banks having total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $1�billion. Each Portfolio anticipates that not more than 10% of its total assets will be so invested or held in cash at any given time, except when the Portfolio is in a temporary defensive posture.
�
Portfolio Turnover
�
In order to qualify for the beneficial tax treatment afforded regulated investment companies, and to be relieved of Federal tax liabilities, the Portfolios must distribute substantially all of their net income to shareholders generally on an annual basis. Thus, the Portfolios may have to dispose of portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or borrow cash in order to satisfy the distribution requirement. The Portfolios do not trade in securities for short-term profits but, when circumstances warrant, securities may be sold without regard to the length of time they have been held. Portfolio turnover rates may vary depending on the volume of buying and selling activities. Rates over 100% are considered high. The Small Cap Opportunities Fund expects to have a portfolio turnover rate greater than 100%. The table below shows the portfolio turnover rates for the past two fiscal years.

Proxy Voting Policies
�
The Portfolios have delegated their authority to vote proxies to the Adviser, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees. The Portfolios believe that the Adviser is in a better position to monitor corporate actions, analyze proxy proposals, make voting decisions and ensure that proxies are submitted promptly. The Adviser�s proxy voting policies are summarized below.
�



�

�
�17
�






�
Policies of the Investment Adviser

It is the Adviser�s policy to vote all proxies received by the Portfolios in a timely manner. Upon receiving each proxy, the Adviser will review the issues presented and make a decision to vote for, against or abstain on each of the issues presented in accordance with the proxy voting guidelines that it has adopted. The Adviser will consider information from a variety of sources in evaluating the issues presented in a proxy. One of the key factors the Adviser considers when determining the desirability of investing in a particular company is the quality and depth of its management. Therefore, the Adviser follows the recommendations of management and generally supports policies, plans and structures that it believes gives quality management teams appropriate latitude to run the business in a way that is likely to maximize value for owners. Conversely, the Adviser generally opposes proposals that clearly have the effect of restricting
the ability of shareholders to realize the full potential value of their investment. 

The Adviser has designated a Proxy Administrator who will be responsible for ensuring that all proxy matters are communicated to the portfolio managers and Chief Investment Strategist for consideration. The Proxy Administrator will then vote the proxies consistent with the instructions by a portfolio manager or Chief Investment Strategist, and the guidelines adopted by the Adviser. In addition, the Proxy Administrator shall be responsible for establishing positions with respect to corporate governance and other proxy issues. The Proxy Administrator also reviews questions and responds to inquiries from clients and mutual fund shareholders pertaining to proxy issues and corporate responsibility.
�
Conflicts of Interest

The Adviser�s duty is to vote in the best interests of the Portfolios� shareholders. In situations where the Adviser perceives a material conflict of interest, the Adviser may disclose the conflict to the relevant clients; defer to the voting recommendation of the clients or of an independent third party provider of proxy services; send the proxy directly to the clients for a voting decision; or take such other action in good faith, in consultation with counsel, to determine the appropriate method to resolve the conflict in the interest of clients, based upon the particular facts and circumstances. With respect to investment company clients, conflicts may arise as to votes involving the investment adviser, the underwriter, their affiliates or affiliates of the investment company. In such cases, the Adviser will follow the voting guidelines described herein, including the process for handling conflicts. Under normal circumstances,
if a conflict is determined not to be material, the Adviser will vote the proxy in accordance with this policy. The method selected by the Adviser to vote proxies in the presence of a conflict may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation and the requirement of applicable law. In all such cases, the Adviser will take steps designed to ensure that the decision to vote the proxies was based on the client�s best interest and was not a product of the conflict.
�
More Information

The Portfolios� actual voting records relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended June�30 (starting with the year ending June�30, 2004) will be available without charge, upon request by calling toll-free, (800) 930-3828 or by accessing the SEC�s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Portfolios� proxy voting policies and procedures are also available by calling toll-free (800) 930-3828 and will be sent within three business days of receipt of a request.

Investment Adviser
�
Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (�Kinetics� or the �Adviser�) is a New York corporation that serves as the investment adviser to the Portfolios. 
 

The Board of the Trustees of the Trust, on behalf of the Portfolios, approved management and advisory contracts (the �Agreements�) with Kinetics. These Agreements continue on a year-to-year basis provided that specific approval is voted at least annually by the Board of Trustees of the Trust or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolios. In either event, it must also be approved by a majority of the Trustees of the Portfolios who are neither parties to the Agreement nor �interested persons� as defined in the 1940 Act at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Adviser�s investment decisions are made subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Trustees. The Agreements may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty,
by the Board of Trustees or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolios. Ultimate decisions as to a Portfolio�s investment policies are made by the Portfolio�s officer and the Trustees.

 



�

�
18
�






�
Under the Agreements, Kinetics furnishes investment advice to the Portfolios by continuously reviewing the securities portfolios and recommending to the Portfolios to what extent securities should be purchased or sold. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Adviser:



(1)��
renders research, statistical and advisory services to the Portfolios;


(2)��
makes specific recommendations based on the Portfolios� investment requirements;


(3)��
pays the salaries of those of the Portfolios� employees who may be officers or directors or employees of the Adviser. 
 

At a meeting of the Board of Trustees held on March 7, 2005, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, approved the Agreements with respect to the Portfolios. In reaching a decision to renew the Agreements, the Board, including all of the Trustees who are not interested persons under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the �Independent Trustees�), considered, among others (1) the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Adviser; (2) the performance of the Portfolios over 6 and 9 months and three and five year periods ended December 31, 2004 compared to the median of its relevant Lipper, Inc. (�Lipper�) peer group, additional peer group information for the Medical Portfolio provided by the Advisor for the period from September 30, 1999
to December 31, 2004, and the methodology used to arrive at the Portfolios included in the peer groups; (3) the contractual and actual compensation to be paid under the Agreements as compared to the compensation paid to relevant Lipper peer groups; (4) the expense ratios of the Portfolios, with expense waivers, as compared to expense ratios for relevant peer groups of Lipper portfolios; (5) the qualifications of the Adviser�s personnel, portfolio management capabilities and investment methodologies; (6) the Adviser�s operations, compliance program and policies with respect to Code of Ethics; (7) the financial condition of the Adviser; (8) the cost of services to be provided by the Adviser and the Adviser�s profitability from each Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2004; (9) �fall-out� benefits to the Adviser and its affiliates from the relationship with
the Portfolios; (10) the extent to which economies of scale are relevant given the Portfolios� current asset size and current asset growth potential; and (11) that each Portfolio other than the Government Money Market Portfolio is designed for long-term investors. The Lipper peer group information was provided by U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, the Company�s administrator.
�
Based on the factors considered, the disinterested Trustees concluded that it was appropriate to renew the Agreements.

Material Conflicts of Interest.
�
The Advisers� portfolio managers are often responsible for managing one or more of the Portfolios, as well as other accounts, including separate accounts and other pooled investment vehicles. A portfolio manager may manage a separate account or other pooled investment vehicle that may have a materially higher or lower fee arrangement with an affiliate of the Adviser than a Portfolio. The side-by-side management of these accounts may raise potential conflicts of interest relating to cross trading, the allocation of investment opportunities and the aggregation and allocation of trades. In addition, while portfolio managers generally only manage accounts with similar investment strategies, it is possible that due to varying investment restrictions among accounts that certain investments could be made for some accounts and not others or conflicting investment positions could be taken among accounts and for other reasons. The Adviser
has a fiduciary responsibility to manage all client accounts in a fair and equitable manner. It seeks to provide best execution of all securities transactions and aggregate and then allocate securities to client accounts in a fair and timely manner. To this end, the Adviser has developed policies and procedures designed to mitigate and manage the potential conflicts of interest that may arise from side-by-side management.

Valuation of the Portfolios
�
Unless otherwise noted, the following applies to all the Portfolios except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio.

Beneficial interests in the Portfolios are sold on a continual basis at the NAV per share next computed following acceptance of an order by the Portfolios. The Portfolios� NAV is determined at the close of normal trading (currently 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each day the New York Stock Exchange (�NYSE�) is open for trading. The NYSE is closed on the following holidays: New Year�s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr.�s Day, President�s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

For all Portfolios except the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio, the Portfolios� investment securities are valued each day at the last quoted sales price on the securities principal exchange. If market quotations are not readily available, securities will be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. The Portfolios may use independent pricing services to assist in calculating the NAV of the Portfolio�s shares.

The Portfolios� investment securities that are listed on a U.S. securities exchange or NASDAQ for which market quotations are readily available are valued using the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (�NOCP�). Price information on listed securities is taken from the exchange where the security is primarily traded. Options, futures, unlisted U.S. securities and listed U.S. securities not traded on the valuation date for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the most recent quoted bid and asked price. 

Trading in foreign securities may be completed at times when the NYSE is closed. In computing the NAV of each Portfolio that trades foreign securities, the value of a foreign security is determined as of the close of trading on the foreign exchange on which it is principally traded or as of the scheduled close of trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier, as provided by the approved pricing services or other alternate sources. In the absence of sales, the last available mean price between the closing bid and asked prices will be used. Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees. Values of foreign securities are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars on the bases of the foreign currency exchange rates, as provided by an independent pricing service or reporting agency, generally prior
to the close of the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the value of foreign securities and such exchange rates occur between the time at which they are determined and the close of the NYSE, which events would not be reflected in the computation of a Fund�s net asset value. If events materially affecting the value of such securities or currency exchange rates occur during such time period, the securities will be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees.
�
Fixed-income securities (other than obligations having a maturity of 60 days or less) are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from pricing services, which take into account appropriate factors such as institutional sized trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market data. Fixed-income securities purchased with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost if it reflects fair value. In the event that amortized cost does not reflect market, market prices as determined above will be used. Other assets and securities for which no quotations are readily available (including restricted securities) will be valued in good faith at fair value using methods determined by the Board of Trustees of the Portfolios.

Beneficial interests in the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio are sold on a continual basis at the NAV per share, which is determined by the Portfolio as of 12:00 p.m. Eastern time each day the NYSE is open for unrestricted business. The Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio will utilize the amortized cost method in valuing its portfolio securities. This method involves valuing a security at its cost adjusted by a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument. The purpose of this method of calculation is to facilitate the maintenance of a consistent net asset value per share for the Kinetics Government Money Market Portfolio
of $1.00. However, there is no assurance that the $1.00 net asset value per share will be maintained.

Portfolio Holdings Information
�
The Trust, on behalf of the Portfolios, maintains policies and procedures relating to selective disclosure of portfolio holdings (�Portfolio Holdings Policies�) that govern the timing and circumstances of disclosure to shareholders and third parties of information regarding the portfolio investments held by the Portfolios. These Portfolio Holdings Policies have been approved by the Board of Trustees of the Trust on behalf of the Portfolios. Disclosure of the Portfolios� complete holdings made quarterly within 60 days of the end of each fiscal quarter in the Annual Report and Semi-Annual Report to Fund shareholders and in the quarterly holdings report on Form N-Q. These reports are available, free of charge, on the EDGAR database on the SEC�s web-site at www.sec.gov. Under the Portfolio Holdings Policies, neither
the Trust nor any of its representatives may solicit or accept any compensation or other consideration in connection with Portfolio Holdings.
�
The Adviser only discloses information concerning securities held by the Portfolios under the following circumstances: 
 



���
twenty business days after the end of the Company�s calendar month, the Adviser posts the top fifteen (15) securities held by each Portfolio on the Trust�s website and their respective percentage of the Portfolio; and


���
as required by the federal securities laws, the Portfolio will disclose portfolio holdings in their applicable regulatory filings, including shareholder reports, reports on Forms N-CSR and N-Q or such other filings, reports or disclosure documents as the applicable regulatory authorities may require.

Portfolio holdings information that is not filed with the SEC or posted on the Trust�s website may be provided to third parties only if the third party recipients are required to keep all portfolio holdings information confidential and are prohibited from trading on the information they receive. Disclosure to such third parties must be approved in advance by the Trust�s or Adviser�s President. The Administrator is responsible for portfolio holdings disclosure to third party service providers of auditing, custody, proxy voting and other similar services for the Funds, as well as rating and ranking organizations, which will generally be permitted; however, information may be disclosed to other third parties (including, without limitation, individuals, institutional investors, and intermediaries that sell shares of the Funds,) only
upon approval by the Trust�s or Adviser�s President, who must first determine that the Fund has a legitimate business purpose for doing so. In general, each recipient of non-public portfolio holdings information must sign a confidentiality and non-trading agreement, although this requirement will not apply when the recipient is otherwise subject to a duty of confidentiality. In accordance with the policy, the identity of those recipients who receive non-public portfolio holdings information on an ongoing basis is as follows: the Trust�s Adviser, the Trust�s transfer agent and Administrator - U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, the Trust�s independent registered public accounting firm, the Trust�s custodian, the Trust�s legal counsel and the Trust�s proxy voting service. Such holdings are released on conditions of confidentiality, which include appropriate trading prohibitions. �Conditions of confidentiality� include confidentiality terms included in written agreements,
implied by the nature of the relationship (e.g. attorney-client relationship), or required by fiduciary or regulatory principles (e.g., custody services provided by financial institutions). Portfolio holdings may also be provided earlier to shareholders and their agents who receive redemptions in kind that reflect a pro rata allocation of all securities held in the portfolio. �Third party providers of custodial or accounting services to the funds may release non-public portfolio holdings information of the Funds only with the permission of the Administrator. From time to time portfolio holdings information may be provided to broker-dealers solely in connection with a Fund seeking portfolio securities trading suggestions. In providing this information reasonable precautions, including limitations on the scope of the portfolio holdings information disclosed, are taken to avoid any potential misuse of the disclosed information.

�
 




�

�
26�
�







�
�
 

The Trust�s Portfolio Holdings Policy sets forth the third parties who receive portfolio holdings information pursuant to ongoing arrangements. Furthermore, the Policy can only be revised by Board approval. The Board will be notified by Kinetics and the Administrator if disclosures are made concerning the Trust�s portfolio holdings in contravention of the Trust�s Portfolio Holdings Policy.
�
In determining the existence of a legitimate business purpose, and in order to ensure that the disclosure of the Trust�s portfolio holdings is in the best interests of the Trust�s shareholders, the following factors, and any additional relevant factors, shall be considered by the Trust or its service providers when disclosing non-public portfolio holdings information to selected third parties: (1) whether the disclosure is consistent with the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws; and (2) avoidance of any conflicts of interest between the interests of the Trust�s shareholders and the service providers.
�
 
Purchasing of Beneficial Interests in the Portfolios
�
Beneficial interests in the Portfolios are sold without a sales load, at the NAV next determined after an order is received by the Portfolios. Investments in the Portfolios are sold solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any �public offering� within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the Portfolios may be made only by regulated investment companies, unregulated foreign investment companies, U.S. and non-U.S. institutional investors, S corporations, insurance company separate accounts, and certain qualified pension and retirement plans. The Registration Statement of which this SAI is a part does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of any offer to buy, any �security� within the meaning of the 1933 Act.

There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in the Portfolios. The Portfolios reserve the right to cease accepting investments at any time or to reject any investment order.

Redemption of Beneficial Interests in the Portfolios
�
An investor in the Portfolios may withdrawal all or any portion of its investment at the NAV next determined after a redemption request in good order is received by a Portfolio. The proceeds of a redemption will be paid by the Portfolios in federal funds normally on the Business Day that the redemption is effected, but in any event within three business days, except as extensions may be permitted by law.
�
The Portfolios reserve the right to pay the redemption price of beneficial interests in kind, i.e. in readily marketable securities. Unless requested by an investor or deemed by the Adviser to be in the best interests of the investors in a Portfolio as a group, the Portfolios will not pay a redemption in kind to an investor, except in situations where that investor may pay redemptions in kind.

The right of any investor to receive payment with respect to any redemption may be suspended, or the payment of the redemption proceeds postponed, during any period in which the NYSE is closed or trading on the NYSE is restricted or to the extent otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act.

Brokerage
�
Each Portfolio�s assets are invested by the Adviser in a manner consistent with the Portfolio�s investment objective, strategies, policies and restrictions and with any instructions the Board of Trustees may issue from time to time. Within this framework, the Adviser is responsible for making all determinations as to the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and for taking all steps necessary to implement securities transactions on behalf of each Portfolio.




�

�
Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges, commodities markets and futures markets and other agency transactions may involve the payment by the Adviser on behalf of the Portfolios of negotiated brokerage commissions. Such commissions vary among different brokers. A particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction. Transactions in foreign investments often involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions, which may be higher than those in the United States. There is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, but the price paid by the Adviser usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or mark-up. In underwritten offerings, the price paid by the Adviser on behalf of the Portfolios includes a disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer. 

U.S. Government securities generally are traded in the over-the-counter market through broker-dealers. A broker-dealer is a securities firm or bank that makes a market for securities by offering to buy at one price and sell at a slightly higher price. The difference between the prices is known as a spread.

In placing orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities for the Portfolios, the Adviser seeks to obtain the best price and execution, taking into account such factors as price, size of order, difficulty and risk of execution and operational facilities of the firm involved. For securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, the Adviser deals directly with the dealers who make markets in these securities unless better prices and execution are available elsewhere. The Adviser negotiates commission rates with brokers based on the quality and quantity of services provided in light of generally prevailing rates, and while the Adviser generally seeks reasonably competitive commission rates, the Portfolios do not necessarily pay the lowest commissions available. The Board of Trustees periodically reviews the commission rates and allocation of orders.

When consistent with the objectives of best price and execution, business may be placed with broker-dealers who furnish investment research or services to the Adviser. Such research or services include advice, both orally and in writing, as to the value of securities; the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities; and the availability of securities, or purchasers or sellers of securities; as well as analyses and reports concerning issues, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. To the extent portfolio transactions are effected with broker-dealers who furnish research services to the Adviser, the Adviser receives a benefit, not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts, without providing any direct monetary benefit to the Portfolios from these transactions. The Adviser believes that most research services obtained by it generally benefit several
or all of the investment companies and private accounts which it manages, as opposed to solely benefiting one specific managed fund or account. 
 

The Trust, on behalf of a Portfolio, may also enter into arrangements, commonly referred to as �broker/service arrangements� with broker-dealers pursuant to which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the cost of certain products or services provided to the Portfolio in exchange for fund brokerage. Under a typical brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a portion of the Portfolio�s custodian, administrative or transfer agency fees, and, in exchange, the Portfolio agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The Adviser, on behalf of the Trust, usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider, which is paid directly by the broker.

The Portfolios may direct certain portfolio trades to unaffiliated brokers who pay a portion of the commissions for those trades in cash to the applicable Portfolio that generated the commission. Prior to April 1, 2005, the Portfolios also had such an agreement with a broker/dealer affiliated with the Adviser. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the total expenses of the Portfolios were reduced by $117,143, $2,295, $75,638, $1,949 and $79,000, for the Internet Portfolio, Internet Emerging Portfolio, Paradigm Portfolio, Medical Portfolio and Small Cap Opportunities Portfolio, respectively, by using directed brokerage credits.

The same security may be suitable for a Portfolio, another portfolio series of the Trust or other private accounts managed by the Adviser. If and when a Portfolio and two or more accounts simultaneously purchase or sell the same security, the transactions will be allocated as to price and amount in accordance with arrangements equitable to the Portfolio and the accounts. The simultaneous purchase or sale of the same securities by the Portfolio and other accounts may have a detrimental effect on the Portfolio, as this may affect the price paid or received by a Portfolio or the size of the position obtainable or able to be sold by the Portfolio.

Taxes
�
The Portfolios will be classified for federal income tax purposes as partnerships that are not �publicly traded partnerships.� As a result, the Portfolios are not subject to federal income tax; instead, each holder of beneficial interest in a Portfolio (�Interestholder�) is required to take into account in determining its federal income tax liability its share of the particular Portfolio�s income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits, without regard to whether it has received any cash distributions from a Portfolio. The Portfolios are also not subject to Delaware income or franchise tax.
�
An Interestholder is deemed to own a proportionate share of that Portfolio�s assets and to earn a proportionate share of that Portfolio�s income, for, among other things, purposes of determining whether the Interestholder satisfies the requirements to qualify as a regulated investment company (�RIC�). Accordingly, the Portfolios intend to conduct their operations so that their Interestholders that invest substantially all of their assets in a Portfolio and intend to qualify as RICs should be able to satisfy all those requirements.
�
Distributions to an Interestholder from a Portfolio (whether pursuant to a partial or complete withdrawal or otherwise) will not result in the Interestholder�s recognition of any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes, except that: (1) gain will be recognized to the extent any cash that is distributed exceeds the Interestholder�s basis for its interest in a Portfolio before the distribution; (2) income or gain will be recognized if the distribution is in liquidation of the Interestholder�s entire interest in a Portfolio and includes a disproportionate share of any unrealized receivables held by a Portfolio; (3) loss will be recognized to the extent that a liquidation distribution consisting solely of cash and/or unrealized receivables is less than the Interestholder�s basis for its interest in a Portfolio prior to the distribution; and (4)�gain or loss may be recognized on a distribution to an Interestholder that contributed
property to a Portfolio. An Interestholder�s basis for its interest in a Portfolio generally will equal the amount of cash and the basis of any property it invests in a Portfolio, increased by the Interestholder�s share of that Portfolio�s income and gains and decreased by (a)�the amount of cash and the basis of any property the Portfolio distributes to the Interestholder and (b)�the Interestholder�s share of the Portfolio�s losses and other deductions.
�



�

�
29�
�






�
The income tax consequences to a non-U.S. Interestholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may be different from those described herein. Non-U.S. Interestholders may be required to provide appropriate documentation to establish their entitlement to the benefits of such a treaty. Non-U.S. Interestholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Portfolios.

APPENDIX A

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS


Short-Term Credit Ratings

A Standard & Poor�s short-term issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation having an original maturity of no more than 365 days. The following summarizes the rating categories used by Standard & Poor�s for short-term issues: 

�A-1� - Obligations are rated in the highest category and indicate that the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.

�A-2� - Obligations are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.

�A-3� - Obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

�B� - Obligations have significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligor�s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 

�C� - Obligations are currently vulnerable to nonpayment and are dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

�D� - Obligations are in payment default. The �D� rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor�s believes that such payments will be made during such grace period. The �D� rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.

Local Currency and Foreign Currency Risks - Country risk considerations are a standard part of Standard & Poor�s analysis for credit ratings on any issuer or issue. Currency of repayment is a key factor in this analysis. An obligor�s capacity to repay Foreign Currency obligations may be lower than its capacity to repay obligations in its local currency due to the sovereign government�s own relatively lower capacity to repay external versus domestic debt. These sovereign risk considerations are incorporated in the debt ratings assigned to specific issues. Foreign Currency issuer ratings are also distinguished from local currency issuer ratings to identify those instances where sovereign risks make them different for the same issuer.

Moody�s short-term ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations. These obligations have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months, unless explicitly noted. The following summarizes the rating categories used by Moody�s for short-term obligations:

�P-1� - Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations. 

 




�

�
31�
�







�
�
 

�P-2� - Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations. 

�P-3� - Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations. 

�NP� - Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories. 

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (�Fitch�) short-term ratings apply to time horizons of less than 12 months for most obligations, or up to three years for U.S. public finance securities, and thus place greater emphasis on the liquidity necessary to meet financial commitments in a timely manner. The following summarizes the rating categories used by Fitch for short-term obligations:

�F1� - Securities possess the highest credit quality. This designation indicates the strongest capacity for timely payment of financial commitments and may have an added �+� to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature. 

�F2� - Securities possess good credit quality. This designation indicates a satisfactory capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, but the margin of safety is not as great as in the case of the higher ratings.

�F3� - Securities possess fair credit quality. This designation indicates that the capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate; however, near-term adverse changes could result in a reduction to non-investment grade.

�B� - Securities possess speculative credit quality. This designation indicates minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus vulnerability to near-term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.

�C� - Securities possess high default risk. Default is a real possibility. This designation indicates a capacity for meeting financial commitments which is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment.

�D� - Securities are in actual or imminent payment default.

The following summarizes the ratings used by Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited (�DBRS�) for commercial paper and short-term debt:

�R-1 (high)��-�Short-term debt rated �R-1 (high)� is of the highest credit quality, and indicates an entity possessing an unquestioned ability to repay current liabilities as they fall due. Entities rated in this category normally maintain strong liquidity positions, conservative debt levels and profitability that is both stable and above average. Companies achieving an �R-1 (high)� rating are normally leaders in structurally sound industry segments with proven track records, sustainable positive future results and no substantial qualifying negative factors. Given the extremely tough definition which DBRS has established for an �R-1 (high)�, few entities are strong
enough to achieve this rating.

�R-1 (middle)� - Short-term debt rated �R-1 (middle)� is of superior credit quality and, in most cases, ratings in this category differ from �R-1 (high)� credits by only a small degree. Given the extremely tough definition which DBRS has established for the �R-1 (high)� category, entities rated �R-1 (middle)� are also considered strong credits which typically exemplify above average strength in key areas of consideration for timely repayment of short-term liabilities. 

�R-1 (low)� - Short-term debt rated �R-1 (low)� is of satisfactory credit quality. The overall strength and outlook for key liquidity, debt and profitability ratios are not normally as favorable as with higher rating categories, but these considerations are still respectable. Any qualifying negative factors which exist are considered manageable, and the entity is normally of sufficient size to have some influence in its industry.

 




�

�

�







�
�
 

�R-2 (high)� - Short-term debt rated R-2 (high) is considered to be at the upper end of adequate credit quality. The ability to repay obligations as they mature remains acceptable, although the overall strength and outlook for key liquidity, debt, and profitability ratios are not as strong as credits rated in the R-1 (low) category. Relative to the latter category, other shortcomings often include areas such as stability, financial flexibility, and the relative size and market position of the entity within its industry.

�R-2 (middle) - Short-term debt rated R-2 (middle) is considered to be of adequate credit quality. Relative to the R-2 (high) category, entities rated R-2 (middle) typically have some combination of higher volatility, weaker debt or liquidity positions, lower future cash flow capabilities, or hold a weaker industry position. Ratings in this category would also be more vulnerable to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.

�R-2 (low)� - Short-term debt rated R-2 (low) is considered to be of only just adequate credit quality, one step up from being speculative. While not yet defined as speculative, the R-2 (low) category signifies that although, repayment is still expected, the certainty of repayment could be impacted by a variety of possible adverse developments, many of which would be outside of the issuer�s control. Entities in this area often have limited access to capital markets and may also have limitations in securing alternative sources of liquidity, particularly during periods of weak economic conditions.

�R-3 (high)�, �R-3 (middle)�, �R-3 (low)� - Short-term debt rated �R-3� is speculative, and within the three subset grades, the capacity for timely payment ranges from mildly speculative to doubtful. �R-3� credits tend to have weak liquidity and debt ratios, and the future trend of these ratios is also unclear. Due to its speculative nature, companies with �R-3� ratings would normally have very limited access to alternative sources of liquidity. Earnings and cash flow would typically be very unstable, and the level of overall profitability of the entity is also likely to be low. The industry environment may be weak, and strong negative qualifying factors are also likely to be present. 

�D� - Short-term debt rated �D� is in arrears. A security rated D implies the issuer has either not met a scheduled payment or the issuer has made it clear that it will be missing such a payment in the near future. In some cases, DBRS may not assign a D rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario, as allowances for grace periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation. Once assigned, the D rating will continue as long as the missed payment continues to be in arrears, and until such time as the rating is suspended, discontinued, or reinstated by DBRS.

Long-Term Credit Ratings

The following summarizes the ratings used by Standard & Poor�s for long-term issues:

�AAA� - An obligation rated �AAA� has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor�s. The obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.

�AA� - An obligation rated �AA� differs from the highest rated obligations only in small degree. The obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong.

�A� - An obligation rated �A� is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong.

�BBB� - An obligation rated �BBB� exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

 




�

�
�33
�







�
�
 

Obligations rated �BB,� �B,� �CCC,� �CC�, and �C� are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. �BB� indicates the least degree of speculation and �C� the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.

�BB� - An obligation rated �BB� is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor�s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

�B� - An obligation rated �B� is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated �BB,� but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor�s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

�CCC� - An obligation rated �CCC� is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.

�CC� - An obligation rated �CC� is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.

�C� - The �C� rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action has been taken, but payments on this obligation are being continued. 

�D� - An obligation rated �D� is in payment default. The �D� rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor�s believes that such payment will be made during such grace period. The �D� rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.

�r� - The symbol �r� is attached to the ratings of instruments with significant noncredit risks. It highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.

�N.R.� - An �N.R.� attached to an obligation indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor�s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.

- PLUS (+) OR MINUS (-) - The ratings from �AA� through �CCC� may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

The following summarizes the ratings used by Moody�s for long-term debt:

�Aaa� - Obligations rated �Aaa� are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal credit risk. 

�Aa� - Obligations rated �Aa� are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.

�A� - Obligations rated �A� are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. 

�Baa� - Obligations rated �Baa� are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. 

 




�

�
34�
�







�
�
 

�Ba� - Obligations rated �Ba� are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. 

�B� - Obligations rated �B� are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.

�Caa� - Obligations rated �Caa� are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.

�Ca� - Obligations rated �Ca� are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest. 

�C� - Obligations rated �C� are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.

Note: Moody�s applies numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification from �Aa� through �Caa.� The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.

The following summarizes long-term ratings used by Fitch:

�AAA� - Securities considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality. These ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk and are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.

�AA� - Securities considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. These ratings denote a very low expectation of credit risk and indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.

�A� - Securities considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. These ratings denote a low expectation of credit risk. The capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.

�BBB� - Securities considered to be investment grade and of good credit quality. These ratings denote that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk. The capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and in economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. This is the lowest investment-grade category.

�BB� - Securities considered to be speculative. These ratings indicate that there is a possibility of credit risk developing, particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met. Securities rated in this category are not investment grade.

�B� - Securities considered to be highly speculative. These ratings indicate that significant credit risk is present, but a limited margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; however, capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment.

�CCC,� �CC� and �C� - Securities have high default risk. Default is a real possibility, and capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained, favorable business or economic developments. �CC� ratings indicate that default of some kind appears probable, and �C� ratings signal imminent default.

 




�

�
35�
�







�
�
 

�DDD,� �DD� and �D� - Securities are in default. The ratings of obligations in these categories are based on their prospects for achieving partial or full recovery in a reorganization or liquidation of the obligor. 

Entities rated in this category have defaulted on some or all of their obligations. Entities rated �DDD� have the highest prospect for resumption of performance or continued operation with or without a formal reorganization process. Entities rated �DD� and �D� are generally undergoing a formal reorganization or liquidation process; those rated �DD� are likely to satisfy a higher portion of their outstanding obligations, while entities rated �D� have a poor prospect of repaying all obligations.

PLUS (+) or MINUS (-) may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the �AAA� category or to categories below �CCC�.

The following summarizes the ratings used by DBRS for long-term debt:

�AAA� - �Bonds rated �AAA� are of the highest credit quality, with exceptionally strong protection for the timely repayment of principal and interest. Earnings are considered stable, the structure of the industry in which the entity operates is strong, and the outlook for future profitability is favorable. There are few qualifying factors present which would detract from the performance of the entity. The strength of liquidity and coverage ratios is unquestioned and the entity has established a creditable track record of superior performance. Given the extremely high standard which DBRS has set for this category, few entities are able to achieve a �AAA� rating. 

�AA� - Bonds rated �AA� are of superior credit quality,�and protection of interest and principal is considered high. In many cases, they differ from bonds rated �AAA� only to a small degree. Given the extremely restrictive definition which DBRS has for the �AAA� category, entities rated �AA� are also considered to be strong credits which typically exemplify above-average strength in key areas of consideration and are unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events. 

�A� - Bonds rated �A� are of satisfactory credit quality. Protection of interest and principal is still substantial, but the degree of strength is less than with �AA�-rated entities. While �A� is a respectable rating, entities in this category are considered to be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions and have greater cyclical tendencies than higher-rated securities. 

�BBB� - Bonds rated �BBB� are of adequate credit quality. Protection of interest and principal is considered acceptable, but the entity is fairly susceptible to adverse changes in financial and economic conditions, or there may be other adverse conditions present which reduce the strength of the entity and its rated securities. 

�BB� - Bonds rated �BB� are defined to be speculative and non investment-grade,�where the degree of protection afforded interest and principal is uncertain, particularly during periods of economic recession. Entities in the �BB� range typically have limited access to capital markets and additional liquidity support. In many cases, deficiencies in critical mass, diversification and competitive strength are additional negative considerations. 

�B� - Bonds rated �B� are highly speculative�and there is a reasonably high level of uncertainty as to the ability of the entity to pay interest and principal on a continuing basis in the future, especially in periods of economic recession or industry adversity. 

�CCC� / �CC� / �C� - Bonds rated in any of these categories are very highly speculative�and are in danger of default of interest and principal. The degree of adverse elements present is more severe than long-term bonds rated �B�. Long-term bonds rated below �B� often have characteristics which, if not remedied, may lead to default. In practice, there is little difference between the �CCC� to �C� categories, with �CC� and �C� normally used for lower ranking debt of companies where the senior debt is rated in the �CCC� to �B� range. 

 




�

�
�36
�







�
�
 

�D� - Long-term debt rated �D� is in arrears. A security rated �D� implies the issuer has either not met a scheduled payment of interest or principal or that the issuer has made it clear that it will miss such a payment in the near future. In some cases, DBRS may not assign a �D� rating under a bankruptcy announcement scenario, as allowances for grace periods may exist in the underlying legal documentation. Once assigned, the �D� rating will continue as long as the missed payment continues to be in arrears, and until such time as the rating is suspended, discontinued or reinstated by DBRS.

(�high�, �low�) - Each rating category is denoted by the subcategories �high� and �low�. The absence of either a �high� or �low� designation indicates the rating is in the �middle� of the category. The �AAA� and �D� categories do not utilize �high�, �middle�, and �low� as differential grades.

Notes to Short-Term and Long-Term Credit Ratings

Standard & Poor�s

CreditWatch: CreditWatch highlights the potential direction of a short- or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to be placed under special surveillance by Standard & Poor�s analytical staff. These may include mergers, recapitalizations, voter referendums, regulatory action or anticipated operating developments. Ratings appear on CreditWatch when such an event or a deviation from an expected trend occurs and additional information is necessary to evaluate the current rating. A listing, however, does not mean a rating change is inevitable, and whenever possible, a range of alternative ratings will be shown. CreditWatch is not intended to include all ratings under review, and rating changes may occur without the ratings having first appeared on CreditWatch. The �positive� designation means that a rating may be raised; �negative�
means a rating may be lowered; and �developing� means that a rating may be raised, lowered or affirmed.

Rating Outlook: A Standard & Poor�s Rating Outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. In determining a Rating Outlook, consideration is given to any changes in the economic and/or fundamental business conditions. An Outlook is not necessarily a precursor of a rating change or future CreditWatch action.

i� ���Positive� means that a rating may be raised.
i� ���Negative� means that a rating may be lowered.
i� ���Stable� means that a rating is not likely to change.
i� ���Developing� means a rating may be raised or lowered.
i� ���N.M.� means not meaningful.

Moody�s

Watchlist: Moody�s uses the Watchlist to indicate that a rating is under review for possible change in the short-term. A rating can be placed on review for possible upgrade (UPG), on review for possible downgrade (DNG) or more rarely with direction uncertain (UNC). A credit is removed from the Watchlist when the rating is upgraded, downgraded or confirmed.

Rating Outlooks: A Moody�s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term. Where assigned, rating outlooks fall into the following four categories: Positive (POS), Negative (NEG), Stable (STA) and Developing (DEV -- contingent upon an event). In the few instances where an issuer has multiple outlooks of differing directions, an �(m)� modifier (indicating multiple, differing outlooks) will be displayed, and Moody�s written research will describe any differences and provide the rationale for these differences. A RUR (Rating(s) Under Review) designation indicates that the issuer has one or more ratings under review for possible change, and thus overrides the outlook designation. When an outlook has not been assigned to an eligible entity, NOO (No Outlook) may be displayed.

�







�
�
 

Fitch

Withdrawn: A rating is withdrawn when Fitch deems the amount of information available to be inadequate for rating purposes, or when an obligation matures, is called, or refinanced.

Rating Watch: Ratings are placed on Rating Watch to notify investors that there is a reasonable probability of a rating change and the likely direction of such change. These are designated as �Positive�, indicating a potential upgrade, �Negative�, for a potential downgrade, or �Evolving�, if ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Rating Watch is typically resolved over a relatively short period.

Rating Outlook: A Rating Outlook indicates the direction a rating is likely to move over a one- to two-year period. Outlooks may be positive, stable or negative. A positive or negative Rating Outlook does not imply a rating change is inevitable. Similarly, ratings for which outlooks are �stable� could be upgraded or downgraded before an outlook moves to a positive or negative if circumstances warrant such an action. Occasionally, Fitch may be unable to identify the fundamental trend. In these cases, the Rating Outlook may be described as �evolving�.

DBRS

Rating Trends

Each DBRS rating category is appended with one of three rating trends - �Positive�, �Stable�, or �Negative�. The rating trend helps to give the investor an understanding of DBRS�s opinion regarding the outlook for the rating in question. However, the investor must not assume that a positive or negative trend necessarily indicates that a rating change is imminent.

Rating Actions
�
In addition to confirming or changing ratings, other DBRS rating actions include: 
Suspended Ratings: Rating opinions are forward looking. Although rating opinions will consider the historical performance of an issuer, a rating is an assessment of the issuer�s future ability and willingness to meet outstanding obligations. As such, for a complete credit quality assessment, DBRS normally requires the cooperation of the issuer so that management strategies and projections may be evaluated and qualified. 

Since the availability of such information is critical to the rating assessment, any reluctance in management�s willingness to supply such information (either perceived or actual) may cause a rating to be changed or even suspended. The eventual action will depend upon DBRS�s assessment of the degree of accuracy of a rating, possibly without the cooperation of management. Suspended ratings indicate that an issuer still has outstanding debt, but DBRS no longer provides a current rating opinion on the credit quality of that outstanding debt.

Discontinued Ratings: When an entity retires all, or virtually all, of its outstanding debt within a particular category and has no plans to re-issue in the near future, DBRS may discontinue its rating. Other less common circumstances where DBRS may also discontinue ratings include situations where the rated debt is no longer in the public market, where a defeasance structure removes the credit risk of the issuer as a consideration or where the debt comes to be held by a few large institutions that do not require ongoing DBRS ratings.

Ratings �Under Review� : In practice, DBRS maintains continuous surveillance of the entities it rates and therefore, all ratings are always under review. Accordingly, when a significant event occurs that directly impacts the credit quality of a particular entity or group of entities, DBRS will attempt to provide an immediate rating opinion. However, if there is high uncertainty regarding the outcome of the event, and DBRS is unable to provide an objective, forward-looking opinion in a timely manner, then the rating(s) of the issuer(s) will be placed �Under Review� since they may no longer be appropriate and can no longer be relied upon. 
 




�

�
�38
�






�
 
Ratings which are �Under Review� are qualified with one of the following three provisional statements: �negative implications�, �positive implications�, or �developing implications�. These qualifications indicate DBRS�s preliminary evaluation of the impact on the credit quality of the issuer/security. Although the three provisional statements may provide some guidance to subscribers, situations and potential rating implications may vary widely and DBRS�s final rating conclusion may depart from its preliminary assessment. For each of these three provisional statements, further due diligence has to be completed in order to determine the applicable rating. In this respect, and while the previous rating may no longer be appropriate and can no longer be relied upon to gauge credit quality, the three provisional statements are an attempt to
provide initial guidance as to possible rating outcomes after the due diligence process has been completed and DBRS has finalized its view.

Municipal Note Ratings

A Standard & Poor�s note rating reflects the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to notes due in three years or less. The following summarizes the ratings used by Standard & Poor�s for municipal notes:

�SP-1� - The issuers of these municipal notes exhibit a strong capacity to pay principal and interest. Those issues determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service are given a plus (+) designation.

�SP-2� - The issuers of these municipal notes exhibit a satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.

�SP-3� - The issuers of these municipal notes exhibit speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.

Moody�s uses three rating categories for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment grade. These ratings are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (�MIG�) and are divided into three levels - �MIG-1� through �MIG-3�. In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated �SG�, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation. The following summarized the ratings by Moody�s for these short-term obligations:

�MIG-1� - This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.

�MIG-2� - This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.

�MIG-3� - This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.

�SG� - This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection.

In the case of variable rate demand obligations (�VRDOs�), a two-component rating is assigned; a long- or short-term debt rating and a demand obligation rating. The first element represents Moody�s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments. The second element represents Moody�s evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the ability to receive purchase price upon demand (�demand feature�), using a variation of the MIG rating scale, the Variable Municipal Investment Grade or �VMIG� rating.
 




�

�
39�
�






�
 
When either the long- or short-term aspect of a VRDO is not rated, that piece is designated �NR�, e.g., �Aaa/NR� or �NR/VMIG-1�.

VMIG rating expirations are a function of each issue�s specific structural or credit features.

�VMIG-1� - This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by the superior short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand.

�VMIG-2� - This designation denotes strong credit quality. Good protection is afforded by the strong short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand.

�VMIG-3� - This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Adequate protection is afforded by the satisfactory short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand.

�SG� - This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Demand features rated in this category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an investment grade short-term rating or may lack the structural and/or legal protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand.

Fitch uses the same ratings for municipal securities as described above for other short-term credit ratings.

About Credit Ratings

A Standard & Poor�s issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation. The issue credit rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a financial obligation. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn.

Moody�s credit ratings must be construed solely as statements of opinion and not as recommendations to purchase, sell or hold any securities.

Fitch credit ratings are an opinion on the ability of an entity or a securities issue to meet financial commitments on a timely basis. Fitch credit ratings are used by investors as indications of the likelihood of repayment in accordance with the terms on which they invested. However, Fitch credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any security. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn.

DBRS credit ratings are not buy, hold or sell recommendations, but rather the result of qualitative and quantitative analysis focusing solely on the credit quality of the issuer and its underlying obligations.

ITEM 25.
INDEMNIFICATION




Reference is made to Article VIII, Section 8.3 of Registrant�s Declaration of Trust and Article IX, Section 9.2 of Registrant�s By-Laws. The general effect of these provisions is to indemnify any person (trustee, director, officer, employee or agent, among others) who was or is a party to any proceeding by reason of their actions performed in their official or duly authorized capacity on behalf of the Trust.





Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 576 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital.




Strategy



The fund is a non-diversified fund that invests all of its investable assets in the Paradigm Portfolio, a series of Kinetics Portfolios Trust. The Paradigm Portfolio invests at least 65% of its net assets in common stocks, ETFs, convertible securities, warrants, and other equity securities having the characteristics of common stocks (such as American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") and International Depositary Receipts ("IDRs")) of U.S. and foreign companies that the Investment Adviser believes are undervalued. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 450 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to provide current income and gains; long-term growth of capital is a secondary objective.




Strategy



The fund is a diversified fund that invests all of its investable assets in the Alternative Income Portfolio, a series of Kinetics Portfolios Trust. Under normal circumstances, the Alternative Income Portfolio will hold a portfolio of primarily fixed income securities and implement an equity put writing option strategy intended to generate returns from the receipt of option premiums.


Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High

This fund scores High because Morningstar has rated its risk above the 80th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Art Portfolios








Professional PortfoliosStudent Portfolios

Portfolios are for protecting, carrying, and presenting works of art. Choose your portfolio based on how you plan to use it. Do you carry supplies and equipment in your portfolio, as well as finished works of art? The portfolio that's best for a job interview or client presentation might not be suited to the wear and tear of everyday use.
