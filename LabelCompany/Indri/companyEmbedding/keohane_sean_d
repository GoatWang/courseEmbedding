This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Cabot Corporation Announces Segment Management Changes






Business Wire




Nov 18, 2014 4:44 PM EST













 




























































  Cabot Corporation (NYSE: CBT)  appoints Sean D. Keohane as executive vice president and president of the Reinforcement Materials segment. In this role, Keohane is responsible for the management of the Reinforcement Materials segment. He will succeed David A. Miller, who previously held that position, and has decided to leave Cabot to pursue other interests. At the same time, Nicholas S. Cross has been appointed executive vice president and president of the Performance Materials segment, succeeding Keohane who previously held that role. Both Keohane and Cross will report to Cabot President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick Prevost.  Mr. Keohane joined Cabot in 2002 in the carbon black business. Since joining the company, Keohane has held several key management positions within the company, most recently as senior vice president and president of the Performance Materials segment. He was also the general manager of the Performance Products business group and global marketing director for the carbon black business. Prior to joining Cabot, Keohane worked for Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies in a variety of general management positions.  Mr. Cross joined Cabot in 2009 as the president of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and has been the president of the Advanced Technologies segment since 2011. In his new role, he will continue as president of the Advanced Technologies segment. Prior to joining Cabot, Cross worked for BP plc for nearly 25 years where he held senior management roles in BP's chemicals, oil and gas businesses.  "Sean's leadership has been instrumental in growing our Performance Materials segment through strategic expansions and new product introductions, resulting in record earnings in fiscal 2014," Prevost said. "Nick's leadership of the EMEA region, during the transitions of our regional headquarters to Schaffhausen and our business service center to Riga has been essential in delivering key results for Cabot. Nick has also successfully led the Advanced Technologies segment, including the recent divestiture of the Security Materials business."
