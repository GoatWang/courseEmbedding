Barometers
Description:  Mercurial barometers were first invented in the 1640s.  Most antique barometers found today are those dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries.  These are generally refurbished and sold to collectors.  A mercury barometer consists of a glass tube that is closed at one end with a mercury-filled reservoir at the base.  There are many different styles of antique barometers (e.g., stick, wheel, or dial) that may contain elemental mercury in the glass tube or as an attached thermometer.  Most of these are sealed systems in which no liquid mercury can escape, even when the barometer is inverted; however some antique barometers do have one end that is open to the atmosphere.

	The exact amount of mercury depends on the style and size of the barometer.  
    




Click image for a larger viewSource: eBay, (antique wheel barometer)


    Most antique barometers contain approximately 4 ounces of mercury, which is equivalent to one quarter of a pound.  However, there are some barometers (mainly those used in scientific or laboratory settings) that have up to 500 grams of mercury, which is equivalent to approximately 1 pound.

Purpose of the Mercury:  A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure.  The level of mercury in the barometer rises or falls with changes in pressure, corresponding to a change in the weather pattern.  Non-mercury barometers exist (e.g., aneroid, digital, and liquid gas silicon), that are both accurate and attractive; however, there is still an interest among collectors in the antique barometers that contain the shiny, silver-colored elemental mercury.
Potential Hazards:  The amount of mercury contained in barometers, combined with the fact that some may have an "open-system" (i.e., one end of the glass tube containing the mercury is open), creates a high potential for a mercury release or spill.  Spills greater than one pound of elemental mercury (about two tablespoons) must be reported to the appropriate state environmental agency.  Persons that have been exposed to a mercury spill should contact the public health department or poison control center.
Recycling/Disposal:  Households are generally exempt from the RCRA hazardous waste requirements.  However, because of the amount of mercury in barometers, they are prohibited from being disposed of in landfills and must be managed as hazardous waste.  Many states offer household hazardous waste collection programs for recycling and disposal of mercury-containing items, including household barometers.  Some states and municipalities provide this service free of charge, while others require a small fee.  Persons should first check with their local municipality to find out about the specific recycling and disposal options (including which products are accepted).
Licensed hazardous waste management firms may also collect, transport, and recycle mercury from the barometers.  Some antique dealers will purchase antique mercury barometers to restore and refurbish and offer them for re-sale.  As noted, antique barometers are fairly expensive; therefore, the likelihood that someone would dispose of one by throwing it in regular trash is relatively slim.
Persons should never attempt to drain or replace mercury from a barometer on their own.  Care should be taken when packing barometers for shipment or disposal in order to prevent breakage and to contain a possible mercury release.  If a leak or break occurs, persons should immediately contact their state environmental agency for instructions on proper clean-up and disposal.  They should contact their public health department or poison control center if they have been exposed to the mercury.

Statutes and Other Information:  In many states, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, barometers are among the list of mercury-added products that are prohibited for sale.  However, because of their relative obscurity and the difficulty in regulating antiques, many antique dealers continue to sell them in the stores and online.  In some cases, states offer a specific exemption for antique barometers.  Some of the states? "blanket" sales ban exemptions are summarized below:
    
Connecticut: Antique mercury-added products, including barometers, may be exempt from the sales prohibition and labeling requirements, if the seller provides documentation showing that the product was manufactured prior to January 1, 2004.  (HB 6567; Connecticut General Statutes Part 22a-623b)
		Maine: The sale of antiques and other used products is exempt from Maine?s ban of the sale of mercury instruments and measuring devices.  (MRSA Title 38, section 1661-C, subsections 6 and 10)
        Massachusetts: Antique barometers, including those with attached mercury thermometers, manufactured before 1955 are exempt from the sales prohibition.  (Proposed SB 2555)
        New York: Re-sale of barometers manufactured before December 31, 2005 are exempt from the sales prohibition.  (Mercury-Added Consumer Products Law Part 27-2107)
        Vermont:  Barometers may not be offered for final sale, sold at a final sale, or distributed in Vermont as a new manufactured product.  Because the word "new" is specified in this law, antique barometers are exempt from the sales prohibition.  (Comprehensive Mercury Management Law Chapter 164, Part 7105, Subpart (e)(1)(A))

Clocks
Description:  Clocks that include a pendulum can contain mercury.  They are sometimes referred to as a long-case, tall-case, or grandfather clock.  The pendulum is a weight that swings at precisely timed intervals, keeping an accurate time on the clock face.  Many of the early- to mid- 17th century clocks used liquid mercury as the pendulum weight.

Purpose of the Mercury:  The mercury in antique clocks is contained in the pendulum and acts as a weight.  The weighted pendulum is designed to keep the center of oscillation constant, so that each "swing" (i.e., rotation) corresponds 
    




Click image for a larger viewSource: Wikipedia, (antique pendulum clock)


    to one second, thereby providing an accurate time.  Most antique pendulum clocks are now kept for decorative purposes and antique value rather than time-keeping.    
  
Potential Hazards:  Antiques become more fragile as they age, which increases the risk of spills from breakage when the items are damaged, dropped, or moved improperly.  Wall-mounted clocks and free-standing clocks both have the potential to fall and break, possibly causing the pendulum to break and release mercury.  If a leak or break occurs, persons should immediately contact their state environmental agency for instructions on proper clean-up and disposal.  They should contact their public health department or poison control center if they have been exposed to the mercury.
Recycling/Disposal:  Many states offer household hazardous waste collection programs for recycling and disposal of mercury-containing items, including antique clocks.  Some states and municipalities provide this service free of charge, while others require a small fee.  Persons should first check with their local municipality to find out about the specific recycling and disposal options (including which products are accepted).

	Also, some antique dealers and repair services will purchase antique pendulum clocks from consumers and restore and refurbish them and offer them for re-sale.

Statutes and Other Information:  Although there may not be any regulations specifically identifying antique clocks as a mercury-added product that is banned from sale, in some states, including Connecticut, Louisiana, and Rhode Island, the amount of mercury they contain (greater than one gram) would prohibit them from being sold.  However, because of the difficultly in regulating antiques, many antique dealers continue to sell them in stores and online.  Some states, including Connecticut, offer a specific exemption for antiques containing mercury.

Mirrors
Description:  Most 16th century mirrors, including mirrors attached to antique dressers, were likely produced using a liquid mercury amalgam.  The mercury is actually contained in the reflective layer behind the glass portion of the mirror.  Other types of antique mirrors that contain mercury include "silvered" mirrors and tin mirrors.  Mirror makers stopped using mercury in the 1840s, instead switching to silver nitrate, which is still used today.

Purpose of the Mercury:  During the 16th century, liquid metals were used in the production of mirrors.  The method involved backing a sheet of flat glass with a thin layer of reflecting metal.  The metal used for this reflecting layer was an amalgam consisting of approximately 25 percent mercury and 75 percent tin.
	




Click image for a larger viewSource: Elemental Services & Consulting Inc. (ESCO), (mercury amalgam scraped off the back of a mirror)


Potential Hazards:  Antique mirrors are surprisingly well-preserved, with the amalgamated mercury not usually a concern.  However, when resurfacing an antique mirror, workers should take proper precautions to avoid inhaling mercury vapor.
Extra care should be taken when cleaning up a broken mirror that contains mercury.  Persons should always wear gloves and place the broken pieces of glass and mercury amalgam in a puncture-resistant container with a sealed lid for hazardous waste disposal.  If a break does occur, it is likely that the mercury vapor concentrations emitted from the mirror amalgam "flakes" would exceed safe indoor air levels.  Persons should immediately contact their state environmental agency for instructions on proper clean-up and disposal.  They should contact their public health department or poison control center if they have been exposed to the mercury.
Recycling/Disposal:  Many states offer household hazardous waste collection programs for recycling and disposal of mercury-containing items, including antique mirrors.  Some states and municipalities provide this service free of charge, while others require a small fee.  Persons should first check with their local municipality to find out about the specific recycling and disposal options (including which products are accepted).
Persons should not attempt to remove the mirror if it is attached to a piece of furniture.  If the mirror were to break, any wastes associated with that break, including the glass and clean-up materials, would need to be disposed of as hazardous waste.
Statutes and Other Information:  Although there may not be any regulations specifically identifying antique mirrors as a mercury-added product that is banned from sale, in some states, including Connecticut, Louisiana, and Rhode Island, the amount of mercury they contain (greater than one gram) would prohibit them from being sold.  However, because of the difficultly in regulating antiques, many antique dealers continue to sell these mirrors in stores and online regardless of state mercury-added products laws.  Some states, including Connecticut, offer a specific exemption for antiques containing mercury.

Organs
Description:  An organ is a musical instrument that produces a sound when air is moved through pipes.  Antique organs, including pipe organs commonly found in churches, usually contain a mercury switch or manometer used to regulate the air pressure and produce a constant, harmonious sound.  These parts comprise the organ?s "wind system," which produces, stores, and delivers the air to the pipes.  Such switches and manometers may contain substantial amounts of mercury.

Purpose of the Mercury:  In most organs, the manometer is connected to the bellows.  This manometer regulates the pressure of air as it is sent from the bellows, causing the reeds to vibrate and make a sound.  The vibrations coming through the individual pipes are blended to create a harmonious sound, which makes the music emitted from pipe organs different than that produced from electronic organs.  The mercury tilt switches contained in organs are usually the on-off switches that are used for main chorus reverb.
    




Click image for a larger viewSource: Maine Dept. of Environmental Protection, (mercury switches removed from pipe organ)


Potential Hazards:  As long as the organ remains intact, there is a low probability that there would be a mercury release.  However, because they may contain a substantial quantity of mercury in the manometer or within multiple switches, breakage may result in significant spillage, high levels of mercury vapor in the air, and costly cleanup.
Recycling/Disposal:  Mercury manometers and/or tilt switches should be removed from the organ prior to disposal.  However, persons should never attempt to do this on their own.  Rather, they should bring the intact organ to a waste facility, which is equipped to safely remove the mercury and that will send it to a mercury recycler for reclamation.

	Once the mercury is removed, the organ pipes may be melted down for reuse and other ornamental parts or materials may be taken off and sold.  Then the left-over scraps of the organ can be disposed of as solid waste.
	




Click image for a larger viewSource: Maine Dept. of Environmental Protection, (mercury tilt switches removed from pipe organ)


Statutes and Other Information:  In many states, including California, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York, measuring devices, such as manometers are among the list of mercury-added products that are prohibited for sale.  Please note that the types of manometers that would be found in a pipe organ are used for measuring the pressure of air - these manometers are defined separately from dairy manometers, which may be subject to different state regulations.
In other states, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, mercury tilt switches are among the list of mercury-added products that are prohibited for sale - whether they are sold alone or as components of another product.  

	Many of the states that ban the sale of these mercury products or components do allow manufacturers of these products to apply for an exemption for selling replacement components, which, if approved, would allow them to sell these components in the state after the effective phase-out date.  Some states provide a specific sales exemption for antiques containing mercury components as integral part of the product, such as organs that contain mercury switches.  Some of the states? "blanket" sales ban exemptions are summarized below:
    
California:  A mercury switch used to replace a switch that is a component of a larger product in use prior to July 1, 2006 and that is integrated in and not physically separate from other components of the larger product is exempt from the sales prohibition.(Health and Safety Code section 25214.8.4(b))
        Illinois:  Replacement switches and relays for a product in use prior to July 1, 2007 and that are not physically separate from other components in the larger product are exempt from the sales prohibition.  (Public Act 093-0964)
		Maine:  The sales prohibition does not apply to antiques and other used products.  However if the units in service prior to July 1, 2006 are being repaired using a new mercury switch or relay, the sale of those replacement parts would be covered if these parts are not considered integrated and not physically separate from the units.  Replacement of the manometer with a new manometer would also need to have an exemption filed unless the use of the unit is covered by a federal requirement.  (MRSA Title 38, section 1661-C, subsections 7 and 10)
		Massachusetts:  A mercury switch or relay that is integrated as a component of a larger product that has been refurbished for resale and which was originally manufactured before the effective date of the law (May 1, 2009) is exempt from the sales prohibition.(SB 2464; "An Act Relevant to Mercury Management" Section 6E)
        New Hampshire:  The sales prohibition does not apply if the mercury switch, relay, or thermostat is used to replace a switch, relay, or thermostat that is a component in a larger product in use prior to July 1, 2008 provided that no compatible non-mercury replacement component exists.("Mercury-Added Product Restrictions" RSA 149-M:53 part V.(a))
    	New York:  The mercury manometer sales prohibition does not apply if the mercury manometer is used to replace a manometer that is a component in a larger product in use prior to January 1, 2007.  The mercury switch sales prohibition does not apply if the mercury switch is used to replace a switch that is a component in a larger product in use prior to January 1, 2008.(Title 21 Mercury-added Consumer Products Law Section 27-2107, Subparts 6 and 7)

Silvered Glass

Description:  "Silvered" glass, also known as mercury glass, is glass blown double walled, then silvered between the layers with a liquid silvering solution, and sealed.  The process involves coating the glass with a reflective substance - an amalgam of precious metals, that could include silver, gold, tin, and mercury.  Vases, goblets, decorative tableware, lamps, candlesticks, and novelty items, such as statues, figurines, and ornaments were often made with silvered glass and decorated by painting, enameling, etching, and engraving.  Silvered glass items were made for display and for artistic value, rather than for utilitarian use.
	




Click image for a larger viewSource: Wikipedia, (antique silvered glass objects)


Silvered glass was produced as early as 1825 in the glassmaking regions of Eastern Europe.  Mercury was only used in the production silvered glass prior to the 1850s. 
Purpose of the Mercury:  Early pieces of silvered glass used mercury amalgams, based on the same technique used for silvering mirrors.  The reflective qualities of mercury amalgam provided the glass surface a mirror-like silvery shine.  However, mercury amalgams proved to be unsuitable for glassmaking.  Mercury left a distorted reflection in the glass, was toxic to the glass blowers, and was too expensive to be practical.  By the late 1840s and 1850s, manufacturers of silvered glass were using a silver nitrate and glucose solution instead of the mercury amalgam.
While some glass pieces may include a date stamped on the bottom, it is often difficult to tell the difference between antique silvered glassware produced using mercury amalgam and those produced with silver nitrate.  Antique experts may be able to date the glass.
Potential Hazards:  Extra care should be taken when cleaning up broken glass that may contain mercury.  Persons should always wear gloves and place the broken pieces of glass in a puncture-resistant container with a sealed lid for hazardous waste disposal.  Persons should contact their state environmental agency for instructions on proper clean-up and disposal and public health department or poison control center if they have been exposed to the mercury amalgam.
Recycling/Disposal:  Some states, including Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont prohibit the disposal of mercury-added products in municipal solid waste.  These items must be managed and disposed of as a hazardous or universal waste, or properly recycled.
Persons should not recycle antique glassware with their regular glass recycling.  Many states offer household hazardous waste collection programs for recycling and disposal of mercury-containing items, including antique glass.  Some states and municipalities provide this service free of charge, while others require a small fee.  Persons should first check with their local municipality to find out about the specific recycling and disposal options (including which products are accepted). 
Some antique collectors seek out silvered glass vessels.  Items that are made of this glass, including vases, goblets, candlesticks, and other pieces of glassware, are considered to be a valuable collector?s item, since they are very old and rare.  Antique dealers may purchase items made of antique silvered or mercury glass to restore and refurbish and offer them for re-sale.
Statutes and Other Information:  Although there may not be any regulations specifically identifying antique glass as a mercury-added product that is banned from sale, in some states, including Connecticut, Louisiana, and Rhode Island, the amount of mercury they contain (greater than one gram) would prohibit them from being sold.  However, because of the difficultly in regulating the sales of antiques, many antique dealers continue to sell silvered glass items in stores and online regardless of state mercury-added products laws.  Some states, including Connecticut, offer a specific exemption for antiques containing mercury.
Production of silvered glass declined around the 1900s, and became obsolete (it was time consuming to make and costly to produce).  In the 1970s, contemporary glass artists rediscovered the use of silvering for decorative purposes and incorporated it into their work.  Today, silvering solution kits that utilize powdered aluminum can be purchased to replicate the silvering process - these kits do not contain mercury amalgam.

A Broken Clock…
John Hussman is a very famous mutual fund manager who made some excellent predictions in the past, forecasting some of the market crashes we have seen in the past decade.  Unfortunately, his song has not changed and he continues to beat his drum about getting out of stocks.  As I read this latest article about why I should get out stocks, I started to think to myself, when does someone start to lose credibility?  According to Morningstar, Hussman’s flagship fund (Hussman Strategic Growth) has generated an annual return of -1.21% per year for the past 10 years.  This trails the overall market (S&P 500) by 8.87% per year during that time period.  To put it another way, if I had put $100,000 into the Hussman Strategic Growth Fund ten years ago I’d have $88,538 today. Conversely, the same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth $261,266.
If Hussman maintains his bearish stance, he’ll be right at some point.  As the saying goes a broken clock is right twice a day.  The market always goes down.  The question is, at what cost?  Missing out on all of the gains we have experienced over the past 5 years will most likely not make up for his avoidance of future losses.  This realization confirms much of our thinking at Greenspring.  No one can predict the future consistently.  Managers like Hussman sound very convincing, but as you look at the data of mutual fund returns, it is hard to argue that their success isn’t almost entirely due to luck.  Understanding this simple fact allows us to focus on the key areas that are under our control:  taxes, costs, diversification and discipline.

FT-DISPLAY



FlashTiming’s FT-Display is a multi-sport wireless LED display and timer. It’s full featured and ideal for a variety of timing purposes, informational messages and advertisements. The display can be controlled by FT-FAT software or any device running either iOS or Android operating system, such as your iPhone, iPad, Android smartphone or tablet.

FT-Display works directly with FlashTiming’s FT-FAT60, FT-FAT120, or FT-FAT200 system to automatically start the race clock and display race entries and results.

Race Clock – starts automatically when the gun goes off or can be started manually with FlashTiming’s built-in stopwatch. As an option, stop or pause the clock on the first bookmark or with the added photo beam to show the winning time. The race clock will automatically reset when a race is recalled.
Place multiple race clocks around the track so runners can see their split times.



Race Results
Results and Entries – display entries of the upcoming race and results after each event. FlashTiming can display each participant’s name, team affiliation and lane position. Post race results on the display after each race.

In addition to the FlashTiming program, use your Android or iOS device to operate the FT-Display in one of 9 modes:

FAT Race Clock – Control the FAT Race Clock with just your smartphone or tablet or in conjunction with the FT-FAT fully automatic timing system. The display automatically detects the start of a race when connected to the display via FlashTiming software. The race clock can also be started manually with your mobile device.

Race Clock and StopWatch with Lap Counter

StopWatch – Use on race day or during practice, the clock counts up from a designated start time and can track lap and split times. Lap and split times are reported on your mobile device and optionally shown on the display. Use the lap counter to keep track of the number of laps completed or remaining in an event. Optionally, sound the buzzer when the clock is stopped or started.


Timer – This mode counts down from a designated start time. Use it to countdown to an event or ensure that athletes are completing a workout in a designated time. Sound the buzzer when the clock reaches zero.
Period Clock
Period Clock – Use as a game clock in an athletic event, such as a soccer or basketball game, or to keep your practice on schedule with the Auto Advance and Interim features. The clock can count up or down and up to 99 periods. Time is displayed in minutes and seconds, with 1/10 seconds for the last ten seconds when counting down.
Set the Auto Advance feature and use FT-Display on the practice field to keep your workouts on schedule. Optionally, set an interim time between drills to allow for transition or rest. Period lengths can be the same duration or set to varying lengths.
Cross Country
Cross Country – Multiple displays can be positioned along the race course with each one showing the sign location, current race time, course length and predicted finish time based on the current pace.
Assign a smartphone or tablet to each FT-Display, or capture the start with one device and synchronize each display from that device (this requires connecting to each display’s hot spot pre-race).


Interval Clock – This mode is designed for paced workouts with scheduled rest periods. The buzzer will sound at the beginning and end of each interval and can be configured to sound at multiple points per interval to indicate pace.
Touch Pad with 2 Athletes
Touch Pad – Add a touchpad and photo beam to your FT-Display and use it for speed and agility tests to accurately benchmark your athletes. Use it to time the 40 yard dash, 5-10-5 shuttle, or test your sprinter’s times out of the blocks. Add a second touchpad and photo beam to time two athletes simultaneously.
Touchpad and photo beam can be configured to arm automatically or manually. The athlete’s time is shown on the display when the beam is broken and reported on your mobile device.
Field Results
Field Results – Use FT-Display as a performance board at field events, with results shown in metric, English or set to toggle between both units. Athletes’ names can be displayed above their results.


Text Display – Display announcements and advertisements in one of three available font sizes.

You load the blender with fruit and yogurt, press the “blend” button, and…nothing happens. Broken appliances can be a real drag and are especially common in old homes.What do you do next?You could try to get it repaired, but you’re not even sure where to find a repair shop these days. Even if you found one, they’re often costly. A new blender could cost around $100, so maybe the repair is still a better deal. But how can you be sure the blender won’t just break again?Don’t let yourself end up in this situation. If you’ve got a broken blender – or a broken anything – sitting around, there are a few simple rules that can help you figure out whether to repair it or replace it.Advantages of RepairingThere are several good reasons to repair things when they break instead of replacing them. Most important: it’s usually cheaper to repair an item. It doesn’t make sense to replace a leaky faucet for $100 if all it needs is a washer that costs less than $1.Repairing is also less wasteful than replacing. This is especially important when trying to reduce your carbon footprint.If you replace the whole faucet, not only are you out an extra $99, you’ve also got an old faucet to dispose. That’s a pretty hefty piece of metal to toss in your trash bin. If you have to pay for trash pickup, throwing out the old faucet will add to your costs – and even if you don’t, it’ll take up space in a landfill.A new faucet also has environmental costs. There’s the damage done by mining the metal that went into it, and the energy used to manufacture it and ship it to the store. If you replace just the washer, you’re using far less material and energy.Advantages of ReplacingReplacing a broken item has its advantages too. A brand-new item is likely to be in better shape than your old one. If your old faucet is dented or covered in grime you’ve never been able to scrub off, a new one will look better.It may work better too. Replacing the old washer could stop your faucet from dripping for a while, but if the faucet is damaged internally, the new washer may wear out in a few months. So, a new faucet could be your best chance of keeping the drips away for good. Plus, if you choose a low-flow faucet, the new one could help cut your water bill.Buying a new faucet also opens up other choices. Your local home center probably has dozens of different styles and finishes to choose from – traditional and modern, chrome and brass, single-handle and double-handle. So if you’ve never really liked the look of the old faucet, replacing it gives you a chance to pick a new one that fits your taste.Last but not least, replacing an item is often less work than repairing it. Replacing a faucet washer only takes a few minutes – but if that doesn’t fix the drip, you could spend hours trying alternative approaches. By your third trip to the hardware store, buying a new faucet and being done with it starts to look like a pretty attractive option.Questions to AskRepairing and replacing both have their perks. The problem is figuring out which is the best option. This is a complicated question because there are a lot of factors involved. No simple rule, such as “Replace it if it’s over eight years old,” is going to cover all of them.Instead, examine all the factors involved in your particular case. The cost of the new item is obviously a big one, but also consider the age of the old item, the difficulty of the repair, and so on.You can work your way through these details by asking yourself some basic questions:1. How Hard Is It to Repair?Some fixes you can do yourself. For example, if a button pops off your shirt, all you need to put it back on is a needle and thread and a few minutes. Simple DIY repairs like this are almost always worth doing. Even if they don’t save you much money, it’s very satisfying to see your hands turn something broken into something that works.Even things you can’t fix yourself are often easy jobs for a trained professional. For instance, frugal-living expert Jeff Yeager writes at AARP that most broken electrical items have fixable problems, such as a faulty electrical cord or a worn-out belt. An electronics repair shop can fix these problems easily.Other items can be trickier to fix. Modern electronic devices often depend on special parts that are expensive to replace. This makes replacing complex gadgets simpler (and often less expensive) than repairing them.There’s also the question of whether you can even find a repair shop. Decades ago, it was possible to find a TV repair person or a shoemaker to re-sole your shoes. Nowadays, skilled repair artists are fewer and farther between. So if you have an item you can’t fix, and you can’t find someone else who can, repairing isn’t an option at all.2. How Do the Costs Compare?Sometimes even a complex repair is still worth doing. Car repairs are a good example. A new car is such a big expense that junking your old car every time it needs a repair – even a complicated, expensive repair – isn’t an option.By contrast, other items are much cheaper to buy – and much more costly to fix. If you’ve got a broken smartphone and you don’t know how to fix it yourself, replacing it could cost less than taking it to a repair center. Similarly, it isn’t worth paying a tailor to take in an old shirt when you could buy a new one for $15 at a big-box store.When balancing the costs of repairing or replacing an item, consumer experts often use a rule called “The 50% Rule.” If repairing your old item costs at least half as much as buying a new one, you should just go ahead and replace it. After all, something that’s already broken once could end up breaking again. If you have to fix it twice, spending half the replacement cost each time, you could have just bought a new one for the money you’ve sunk into patching up the old one.If your gadget has already been repaired once, the experts at Consumer Reports say even 49% may be too much to spend on fixing it again. When the same item has broken twice, that’s a sign that it isn’t reliable. So unless the repair cost is cheap, replacing it could be a better bet. But, if your broken item is still under warranty, the repeated repairs aren’t costing you anything, so just fix it again and hope for the best.3. How Worn Out Is It?How long will repairing your item will actually extend its life. There’s no point in spending money to fix something that needs to be replaced in a few months anyway.For instance, if your 20-year-old water heater breaks, there’s not much point in trying to fix it. According to handymen McGarry and Madsen, the average lifespan of a water heater is only 12 to 14 years, so you’re lucky your old heater has lasted this long. The only time it’s worth fixing something that’s already on its last legs is when you can do a quick DIY patch job to buy yourself a little time while shopping for a new one.However, even old appliances can be worth repairing if they’re well made. Older appliances are often more than modern ones. If you own one of these old workhorses, a simple repair could keep it chugging along for several more years.The same goes for any other product that’s built to last. For instance, say you’ve been wearing the same high-quality pair of leather boots for 10 years, and now the soles are worn out. As long as the uppers are in good shape, it’s probably worth spending $50 to have them re-soled.By contrast, anything that was cheap to start with probably isn’t worth fixing. If your old boots only cost $15 and they wore out in one year, it isn’t worth slapping a pair of $50 soles on them. Chances are, the uppers will just wear out in another year, making it a waste of $50.4. Is It Costing You Money?Old appliances often cost more to run than new ones. Thanks to new efficiency standards, modern fridges, washers, and other appliances use much less energy than old relics from the ’70s and ’80s.For example, according to ENERGY STAR, a refrigerator dating from before 1980 uses more than $300 worth of electricity each year. A new Energy Star fridge would cost only $46 a year to run. That means the new fridge would save more than $1,170 in energy costs over its first five years – possibly more than the purchase price.Old appliances aren’t the only thing around your house that can cost you money. Old single-pane windows jack up your energy bill by letting heated or cooled air out of your house. Crumbling plumbing fixtures often use more water than newer ones, adding to your water bill.To compare the true cost of repairing and replacing an item, take these ongoing costs into account. Simply calculate the five-year cost of both the new item and the repair. Here’s how:Determine how much the old item is costing you per year. Include all the costs of running it, such as water and electricity costs for a washing machine. Then multiply that number by five. The result is its five-year operating cost.Find out how much it will cost to repair the old item. Add that cost to the number you got in the first step. This is the total five-year cost of keeping the old item in working condition.Now calculate how much a replacement would cost to run over that same five-year period. Add that cost to its purchase price. This is the total five-year cost of the new version.Compare the two numbers. If the first one is lower, that means it’s cheaper to repair the item than replace it. If it’s higher, replacement is the more affordable option.5. Will Its Value Increase?Most things decline in value as they age. For example, a one-year-old car is worth nearly 20% less than a brand-new one, according to Edmunds. Clothes, appliances, and furniture also lose value as they grow older and more worn out.However, there are some items – such as antiques and collectibles – that increase in value over time. If your defective item is an antique – or something that might one day become an antique – the money you put into repairing it is an investment. Some day, that old chair could be worth many times what you spend today to fix it.It’s not always obvious when something you own is likely to gain in value. For instance, frugal-living expert Jeff Yeager tells the story of a “clunky” old set of JBL speakers he owned as a teenager. He thought they looked dated and wanted to replace them with a newer, cheaper set. But his father vetoed that plan – and today, those old “classics” are worth nearly as much as his 401k account.6. What’s the Disposal Cost?Sometimes, the cost of replacing an item doesn’t end when you buy a new one at the store – you may have to pay to dispose of the old one. For example, in some towns, you have to pay extra to put out bulky items (such as appliances) for trash pickup.Before you decide to replace an item, find out how you can get rid of the old one. If this will cost you extra, add those disposal costs when you’re calculating the five-year cost of replacement. That extra cost could be enough to tip the balance and make repairing the cheaper option.Remember that replacing an old item doesn’t have to mean throwing it out. If the old, broken item only needs a minor repair – or if it could be used for spare parts – someone else might be willing to take it off your hands. Try listing it on your local Freecycle group, or just put it out by the curb with a sign that says “free.” If anybody wants it, you can avoid the cost of disposal and help your community.7. Do You Love It?In many cases, deciding whether to repair or replace is a simple matter of dollars and cents. But sometimes, it’s more complicated. If the item that’s broken is something you truly love, then a new one can never replace it.For example, suppose you have an old bicycle that you bought as a teen with the money from your first job. It’s not as fancy as a newer bike, but it was the first big purchase you ever made, and you’ve ridden it for so many years that it feels like a part of you. To you, that old bike’s value is more than the price it would fetch on Craigslist. So even if repairing it would cost more than buying a new bicycle, it’s worth it on a personal level.Just as it’s worth paying more to keep something you love, it’s not worth paying to keep something you hate. If your bathroom has an old, mustard-yellow toilet that you just can’t stand the sight of, having it break down gives you a chance to upgrade. Even if you could repair it with just a $5 wax ring, it could be worth spending an extra $95 for a new toilet that you enjoy.Getting the Best DealWhether you repair or replace, you want to get the best value. There’s no point in spending money on a repair that won’t hold up or a replacement that won’t last. Here are several tips on how to get the best possible deal.The Best Deal on RepairsIt’s always cheapest to repair an item yourself – if you know how. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you could make the problem worse. For instance, suppose you take apart a broken clock and then can’t figure out how to adjust it. At that point, having it put back together may cost more than buying a new clock.That doesn’t mean you always need to seek out a professional for jobs that are new to you. Before you shell out money for repairs, try doing an Internet search on the repair, such as “fix leaky toilet.” Often, a quick search will give you step-by-step instructions.Sometimes you can even find videos that walk you through the process. There are many how-to videos on YouTube posted by both professionals and homeowners. Another useful site is RepairClinic, which features more than 1,400 videos showing how to fix all sorts of appliances, lawn care tools, and HVAC equipment.If you can’t fix it yourself, go to a local repair shop. In a 2013 survey, Consumer Reports found that people who used independent shops were happier with the results than those who used factory service. Local shops are usually cheaper too – especially for large appliances and lawn equipment.There is one catch, however: If your product is still under warranty, you have to use a factory-authorized repair shop. If you don’t, you could void the warranty. In this case, all you can do is make sure the repair person is trained to handle your product.The Best Deal on ReplacementIf you decide to replace your product, do some research before you buy. Check reviews at ConsumerSearch or The Wirecutter to find a new one that will work well and hold up over time. You can also consult Consumer Reports online if you have a subscription, or check the printed issues at your local library.When shopping for a replacement, plan ahead. Nearly everything breaks sooner or later, so it’s best to buy a product that’s easy to repair. For instance, when you buy an appliance, make sure that it’s easy to find parts for it. If you’re buying a car, find out which repair shops in your area know how to work on that model.Even for a smaller purchase, such as a pair of shoes, planning ahead can save money in the long run. If you buy sturdy shoes with soles that can be replaced when they wear out, you should be able to re-sole them three to ten times before the uppers wear out. All in all, you could get 20 years of life out of one pair of shoes. That’s a lot cheaper in the long run than buying a new pair of cheap shoes every year.One thing that’s not worth paying extra for is a warranty. Consumer Reports found most products don’t break until after the warranty is up. Even when they do, the savings aren’t that great. On average, people who bought a warranty or service contract paid $136 for it, while those who paid for repairs out-of-pocket spent only $16 more.Worse still, the people who got their repairs done under warranty weren’t as happy with the results. They were more likely than other people to wait two weeks or longer for a repair. They were also more likely to have the repair done incorrectly.Once you’ve bought your new item, take care of it. Read the manual, and follow its advice about maintenance. For clothing and shoes, follow the care instructions on the label. An item that’s handled properly won’t wear out as fast, so you’re more likely to get your money’s worth out of it.Final WordGetting things fixed certainly isn’t as easy as it used to be. As items like clothing and electronics have become cheaper, many repair shops have gone out of business.Still, fixing items yourself can be easier these days. The Internet makes it simple to find out how to fix all kinds of things at home. Online guides can show you how to repair clothing, books, appliances, and even computers.So when something breaks, at least look into the possibility of repairing it. If it’s fixable, you can save a lot of money and prevent waste. If not, at least you can feel confident that replacing it was the right choice.Do you usually prefer to repair things that break, or replace them?Related163 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInAmy LivingstonAmy Livingston is a freelance writer who can actually answer yes to the question, "And from that you make a living?"

				Hazardous Waste & Universal Waste (U-Waste)
Wastes Banned From the Trash


More information...

Visit our new Sharps and Medical 
				Waste page!

Where to take hazardous and 
				u-waste


Many common products that we use in our daily lives contain potentially hazardous 
		ingredients and require special care when disposed of. It is illegal to dispose of hazardous waste in the 
		garbage, down storm drains, or onto the ground. Chemicals in illegally 
		disposed hazardous waste can be released into the environment and 
		contaminate our air, water, and possibly the food we eat. And by 
		throwing hazardous waste in the garbage, you can cause additional 
		hazards to your garbage handler.
Regulations to protect public health and the environment have been 
		changing. This is because we now know that some common items that have 
		traditionally been thrown in your household's or small business' trash cannot be safely disposed in 
		landfills. These common items are referred to as hazardous waste, and 
		some of them as "universal waste" 
		(u-waste). As of February 9, 2006, all "u-waste" items are banned 
		from the trash. For additional information on u-waste, please check the
		Department of Toxics Substances Control (DTSC) Web site.
The bottom line is that we must keep hazardous materials 
		out of the trash by bringing them somewhere to be recycled or safely 
		disposed such as a household hazardous waste collection facility. Check 
		with your local waste management 
		agency to find out where to take these items in your area.
What Is Banned?
Lights, Batteries, and Electronics

Fluorescent lamps and tubes. Includes fluorescent 
			tubes, compact fluorescent lamps, metal halide lamps, and sodium 
			vapor lamps.
Batteries. Includes all batteries, AAA, AA, C, D, 
			button cell, 9-volt, and all others, both rechargeable and single 
			use. Also lead-acid batteries such as car batteries.
Computer and television monitors. Most monitors are 
			currently considered hazardous waste when they have lived their life 
			and are ready for recycling or disposal, including cathode ray tube 
			(CRT), liquid crystal diode (LCD), and plasma monitors. Learn about 
			the State program to offset the cost of proper television and monitor recycling.
Electronic devices. Includes computers, printers, VCRs, cell phones, telephones, 
			radios, and microwave ovens. Refer to "How do I 
			know if a particular electronic device can't be thrown in the trash?" for more information.

Mercury-Containing Items

Electrical switches and relays. These typically contain about 
			3.5 grams of mercury each. Mercury switches can be found in some 
			chest freezers, pre-1972 washing machines, sump pumps, electric 
			space heaters, clothes irons, silent light switches, automobile hood 
			and trunk lights, and ABS brakes.
Thermostats that contain mercury. There is a mercury 
			inside the sealed glass "tilt switch" of the old style thermostats 
			(not the newer electronic kind).
Pilot light sensors. Mercury-containing switches are found 
			in some gas appliances such as stoves, ovens, clothes dryers, water 
			heaters, furnaces, and space heaters.
Mercury gauges. Some gauges, such as barometers, 
			manometers, blood pressure, and vacuum gauges contain mercury.
Mercury thermometers. Mercury thermometers typically 
			contain about a half gram of mercury. Many health clinics, 
			pharmacies and doctor's offices have thermometer exchange programs 
			that will give you a new mercury-free fever thermometer in exchange 
			for your old one.
Mercury-added novelties. Examples include greeting cards 
			that play music when opened; athletic shoes (made before 1997) with 
			flashing lights in soles; and mercury maze games.

Household and Landscape Chemicals

Flammables and poisons. Includes solvent-based (oil) paints and reactive 
			and explosive materials.
Acids, oxidizers, and bases. Includes some pool chemicals 
			and cleaners.
Pesticides and herbicides. Many pesticides and herbicides 
			cannot be disposed in the trash. Consult the product label or
			check with your local household hazardous waste agency.

Paints and Solvents

Latex paint.
Oil-based paint (also listed under flammables).
Nonempty aerosol paint or solvent cans (all nonempty 
			aerosol cans are banned from the trash). 
Solvents. Includes materials such as paint thinners, finger nail polish remover, etc.

Building Materials

Asbestos. Includes some older kinds of cement, roofing, 
			flooring and siding. More information on 
			asbestos in your home 
			is available from the U.S. EPA. 
Treated Wood. Includes wood that is treated with chromium 
			copper arsenate (CCA).

Automobile-Related

Antifreeze.
Batteries.
Motor oil and filters.
Tires. (Note that tires are 
			not considered hazardous, but automotive tires are banned from the trash for other reasons)

Other

Compressed gas cylinders. Includes propane tanks used for BBQ or plumbing.
Needles and sharps generated in home health care. Includes 
			hypodermic needles, hypodermic needles with syringes, blades, 
			needles with attached tubing, syringes contaminated with biohazardous waste, acupuncture needles, root canal files, broken 
			glass items such as Pasteur pipettes, and blood vials.
PCB-containing materials. Includes paint and ballasts 
			that contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB).
Photo waste (silver bearing).
Nonempty aerosol cans that contain hazardous materials. Many 
			products in aerosol cans are toxic. And many aerosol cans contain 
			flammables, like butane, as propellants for products like paint. If 
			your aerosol can is labeled with words like TOXIC or FLAMMABLE don't 
			put it in the trash unless it is completely empty.

How do I know if a particular electronic device can't be thrown in the trash?
		The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has tested many 
		electronic devices including: tube-type and flat panel televisions and 
		computer monitors, laptop computers, computers central processing units 
		(CPU), printers, radios, microwave ovens, video cassette recorders 
		(VCR), cell phones, cordless phones, and telephone answering machines. 
		The devices that DTSC tested contained concentrations of metals (lead 
		and copper) high enough to make them hazardous wastes when they are 
		discarded. Unless you are sure they are not hazardous, you should 
		presume these types of devices need to be recycled or disposed of as 
		hazardous waste and that they may not be thrown in the trash.
