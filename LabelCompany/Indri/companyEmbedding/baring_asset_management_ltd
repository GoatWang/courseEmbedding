History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]

Services[edit]
Baring Asset Management provides investment management services to investors worldwide, with a particular focus on emerging and inefficient markets; asset allocation and specialist fixed income.[9]
History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
