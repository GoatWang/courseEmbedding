Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc.

 Share this article




























































WUHAN, China, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ABAC) ("Aoxin Tianli" or the "Company"), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.








Mr. Wocheng Liu, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Aoxin Tianli, commented, "While our retail business continued to grow benefitting from strong orders from a new online e-commerce customer, our hog farming business declined in the first quarter as a result of decreases in both the number of hogs sold and the average selling price per hog. The decrease in the number of hogs sold was mainly related to our black hog program in Enshi Prefecture where severe floods in July 2016 caused significant damages to our independently operated black hog farms and limited the number of black market hogs available for sale in the first quarter. Additionally, we saw downward trend for hog prices that started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and continued into this year. We believe this was related to the fact that a number of large state owned enterprises and publicly traded companies entered into the hog farming industry. This, combined with the uptick in feed cost in recent months, would continue to put pressure on existing hog farmers, particularly smaller players, in our view."

Revenues
Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 decreased by $2.38 million, or 26.3%, to $6.68 million from $9.06 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in revenues reflected the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, lower prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and fewer black hogs available for sale after the July 2016 flood damage.
Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $2.67 million, or 30.9%, to $5.97 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $8.64 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 30,217 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $198 per hog during the first quarter of 2017, compared to 35,112 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $246 per hog for the same period of last year.

Press Releases



Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results






May 12, 2017, 4:30pm EDT














WUHAN, China, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAC) ("Aoxin Tianli" or the "Company"), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Mr. Wocheng Liu, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Aoxin Tianli, commented, "While our retail business continued to grow benefitting from strong orders from a new online e-commerce customer, our hog farming business declined in the first quarter as a result of decreases in both the number of hogs sold and the average selling price per hog. The decrease in the number of hogs sold was mainly related to our black hog program in Enshi Prefecture where severe floods in July 2016 caused significant damages to our independently operated black hog farms and limited the number of black market hogs available for sale in the first quarter. Additionally, we saw downward trend for hog prices that started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and continued into this year. We believe this was related to the fact that a number of large state owned enterprises and publicly traded companies entered into the hog farming industry. This, combined with the uptick in feed cost in recent months, would continue to put pressure on existing hog farmers, particularly smaller players, in our view."

Revenues
Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 decreased by $2.38 million, or 26.3%, to $6.68 million from $9.06 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in revenues reflected the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, lower prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and fewer black hogs available for sale after the July 2016 flood damage.
Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $2.67 million, or 30.9%, to $5.97 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $8.64 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 30,217 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $198 per hog during the first quarter of 2017, compared to 35,112 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $246 per hog for the same period of last year.

We sold 136,682 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $0.71 million for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to 87,384 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.42 million for the same period of last year. The increase in our specialty black hog pork products was mainly related to a new online e-commerce customer.

The results of operations of Hang-ao and its wholly owned subsidiaries, were reclassified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016 based on the Company's decision to focus on the hog industry. Hang-ao was sold on December 23, 2016.

The decrease in cost of goods sold for hog farming was primarily due to lower sale volume, which was partly offset by increased feed costs.

WUHAN CITY, China, Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:   ABAC) ("Aoxin Tianli" or the "Company"), a leading producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced a one (1) -for- four (4) reverse stock split (the "Reverse Split") of its authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the "Common Stock"). The Reverse Split will be effective and the Common Stock will begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq") on a split-adjusted basis at the market opening on September 9, 2016. The Company's Common Stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol "ABAC" but with a new CUSIP number G0404E 112.  








The Reverse Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Company's Common Stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
As a result of the Reverse Split, every four issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share. This will reduce the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock from 31,952,000 to approximately 7.99 million, and the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock from 100,000,000 to 25,000,000. No fractional shares will be issued. All fractional shares created by the Reverse Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. You need not return any stock certificates you may hold or contact the Company, its transfer agent or your broker. The Company's transfer agent will update its books and records to reflect the Reverse Split. All book-entry and other electronic positions representing issued and outstanding shares of the common stock will be automatically adjusted. Shareholders whose shares are in electronic form at brokerage firms do not require action, as the effect of the Reverse Split will automatically be reflected in their brokerage accounts. 
For further information regarding the Reverse Split, please refer to the Company's Form 8-K to be filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov.
