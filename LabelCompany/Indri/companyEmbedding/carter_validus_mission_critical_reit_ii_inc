Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II



























SCHEDULED TO CLOSE NOVEMBER 24, 2017**This initial offering will close to new investments upon the earlier of (A) raising
			a total of $2.25 billion in gross proceeds from the primary offering, (B) November 24, 2017, 4:00 PST or (C) if the board decides to terminate early.




























1) The amount of distributions that will be paid, if any, is uncertain. There is no guarantee that we will continue paying distributions. We have paid regular monthly distributions to our stockholders, and intend to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial conditions, general economic conditions, applicable provisions of Maryland law or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount of distributions will be determined by our board of directors, in its discretion, and may vary from time to time. We have paid, and may continue to pay, without limitation, distributions from sources other than from our cash flow from operations including, but not limited to the proceeds of our offering, borrowings or the sale of assets. As of January 20, 2017, we had paid aggregate distributions, since inception, of approximately $65,819,000 ($28,245,000 in cash and $37,574,000 reinvested in shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan [the “DRIP”]). The distribution rate for Class T shares is net of the distribution and servicing fee. With respect to Class T shares sold in its primary offering, CVMC REIT II will pay the dealer manager a distribution and servicing fee that accrues daily equal to 1/365th of 1.0% of the most recent purchase price per Class T share on a continuous basis from year to year, payable out of amounts that otherwise would be distributed to holders of Class T shares; provided, however, that upon the termination of the primary offering, the distribution and servicing fee shall be an amount that accrues daily equal to 1/365th of up to 1.0% of the most recent estimated NAV per Class T share on a continuous basis from year to year. CVREIT II will cease paying distribution and servicing fees with respect to all Class T shares sold in the primary offering on the earliest to occur of the following: (i) a listing of the Class T shares on a national securities exchange, (ii) following the completion of the Offering, total underwriting compensation in this Offering equaling 10% of the gross proceeds from our primary offering, (iii) there are no longer any Class T shares outstanding;or (iv) the fourth anniversary of the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the primary offering terminates. CVREIT II will not pay a distribution and servicing fee with respect to Class T shares issued under the DRIP;however, the distribution and servicing fees payable with respect to Class T shares sold in the primary offering will be allocated to Class T shares as a class cost, and therefore will impact the amount of distributions payable on all Class T shares, including those issued under the DRIP.

Non-Traded REIT Programs



Investors looking to diversify their portfolios with stable, long-term income and asset growth often add Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to their investment strategy. Non-traded real estate returns are generally not correlated to stock market performance.
The Carter Validus programs are primarily designed to:

Pay regular cash distributions**
Preserve, protect and return capital contributions
Offer potential for capital appreciation
Focus on diversified, stable assets
Be prudent, patient and deliberate with respect to the purchase and sale of our investments considering current and future real estate markets












Mission Critical Real Estate



Drawing on the depth of experience of the Carter Validus team, Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT (“CVMCR”) and Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II (“CVMCR II”) are currently assembling portfolios of net-leased real estate within the data center and healthcare industries.
CVMCR and CVMCR II’s focus on a diversified portfolio of mission-critical net-leased assets, with built-in contractual rent increases, provides the offerings’ shareholders with an opportunity to enjoy predictable, contractually obligated income streams. By investing in two mission critical growth industries, CVMCR and CVMCR II have increased the flexibility in exit options. This strategy enables each REIT to, not only list publicly or sell to one net lease buyer, but rather to exit through a sale to two separate buyers – a healthcare investor and a data center investor. This strategy broadens options as CVMCR and CVMCR II assemble an attractive portfolio of both data center and healthcare assets, ensuring the best execution for REIT shareholders.

Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc. (“CV Mission Critical REIT II”) has acquired five properties in March 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $141.5 million. 
Norwalk Data Center 
Acquired by CV Mission Critical REIT II for approximately $58.9 million, the Norwalk Data Center is a powered-shell colocation data center property located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Standing as the largest data center in the state, the facility totals 167,691 rentable sq ft comprised of 75,000 sq ft of data center space, 30,000 sq ft of office space, and approximately 62,000 sq ft of supporting infrastructure. The Norwalk Data Center is 100% leased to Cervalis, LLC, a subsidiary of CyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE). CyrusOne is an owner, operator, and developer of enterprise class, carrier neutral, multi-tenant data center properties. 
Aurora Healthcare Facility 
The Aurora Healthcare Facility was acquired by CV Mission Critical REIT II for approximately $11.5 million. Built in 2002 and located in Aurora, Illinois, across from the Rush-Copley Medical Center Campus, the 24,722 rentable-square-foot facility is 100% leased on a 9.5-year term to Copley Memorial Hospital, Inc. The facility currently houses an ambulatory surgery center, pre- and post-operating bays, cast rooms, a bone density room and imaging capabilities. Additional services offered include outpatient physical therapy and outpatient orthopedic surgeries. 
Texas Rehabilitation Hospital Portfolio 
CV Mission Critical REIT II acquired a portfolio of three fully-occupied inpatient rehabilitation facilities on March 31, 2017 for approximately $71.1 million. One property is located in Austin, Texas and is fully leased to HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of South Austin, LLC. The other two properties are fully leased to affiliates of Post Acute Medical, LLC, (“PAM”) and are located in Allen, Texas and Beaumont, Texas. PAM is a national developer and operator of freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals with operations in eight states. Together, the three properties total 169,722 sq ft of leased space. 
“We believe these acquisitions represent our commitment to invest in high-quality real estate in the growing data center and healthcare industries. We further believe the critical nature of these buildings to the tenants that occupy them, along with their favorable locations and property conditions make them attractive acquisitions for CV Mission Critical REIT II,” said John E. Carter, chief executive officer of CV Mission Critical REIT II. 
Michael A. Seton, president of CV Mission Critical REIT II, commented, “We are thrilled to add these fully-occupied, net leased properties to our expanding portfolio. We believe acquisitions like these align well with our high-growth, net lease, mission critical investment strategy, and anticipate that they will translate into added value for our stockholders.” 
Subsequent to these acquisitions, CV Mission Critical REIT II entered into two term loans: 

A $34.2 million loan with Bank of America, National Association on April 19, 2017 
A $39.9 million loan with Capital One, National Association on April 20, 2017

 WHAT IS MISSION CRITICAL REAL ESTATE?



                  “Mission Critical” real estate assets are typically purpose-built, mandatory facilities designed to
                  support the most critical operations of tenants. They are generally indispensable and crucial to
                  the success and continued operation of the business. Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II (“CVMC
                  REIT II”) will employ its “mission-critical” investment strategy by focusing on vital Data Center and
                Healthcare properties that support the revenue-generating operation centers of our tenants.1


 







 
 
 
 


 
 1 There can be no assurance that CVMC REIT II will meet these objectives. 

        Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc. (“the Company”) has no operating history or established financing sources. As a result, an investment in the Company is speculative. In addition, the offeree will not be acquiring an interest in the Company’s advisor.

        Investments in the healthcare property sector contain certain risks, including the fact that adverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively
        affect lease revenues and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Please consult the prospectus for additional risks.

        by means of a prospectus. The prospectus must be read in order to understand fully all the implications and risks of any offering of securities to which it relates.
