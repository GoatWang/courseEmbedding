Cobia Capital


Cobia Capital Management LP is a value-oriented long/short equity fund focused on the small capitalization technology sector. The Fund seeks to add alpha through deep fundamental analysis and bottoms up stock picking of smaller technology stocks in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe. Cobia was founded in 2008 by Jeffrey Meyers and is headquartered in New York City.
Overview
Cobia Capital believes that exceptional understanding of the technology sector and a deep knowledge of the companies in the small cap universe provide a keen research advantage in an underexploited space. Smaller companies usually have less sell-side analyst coverage and are not practical investments for large mutual funds, leading to an uncrowded sector. Market inefficiencies are a natural result of less coverage and fewer investors; as a result small-caps more frequently have inexpensive valuations on an absolute and relative basis compared to peers. Cobia seeks to identify such companies and benefit from valuation gaps closing once the companies demonstrate meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion, bringing them to the attention of other market participants.
Jeffrey Meyers
Founder and Chief Investment Officer
Jeffrey Meyers has over 20 years of experience investing in small cap technology companies. He has developed a deep understanding of what factors lead to success and failure in these companies, as well as intimate knowledge of every technology sub-sector. Mr. Meyers’ experience focused on the inefficient small cap technology space has resulted in significant alpha generation at Cobia since the fund’s inception.

Value-Oriented Approach to an Underfollowed Sector - Cobia Capital




















































Value-Oriented Approach to an Underfollowed Sector


Cobia seeks to invest in overlooked and mispriced assets with positive catalysts to cause revaluation by the market. Focused on small cap technology companies, primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe, Cobia believes that deep understanding of company fundamentals provides the confidence and conviction to make concentrated investments. The Fund takes a multi-layered view including macro, industry, and company considerations to determine appropriate target valuations for investments. Cobia maintains a discipline of analyzing both upside and downside scenarios for all investment candidates. Long investments are made in companies with significant revenue and earnings growth potential not yet recognized by the market. Short investments are made in companies whose business prospects and / or current financial strength do not support market valuation. Both longs and shorts are considered as stand-alone alpha generators.
Cobia examines the investible small cap technology universe for optimal risk / reward opportunities. Idea generation is a function of proprietary screens that whittle the investment universe down to companies currently maintaining attractive valuations; management teams from current and past investments who provide new ideas to look at in their sectors; trade shows which provide an opportunity to network with engineers and salespeople and garner new investment ideas; and brokerage conferences and discussions with hedge fund peers. Once a potential investment is identified, Cobia undertakes a comprehensive research process that includes extensive field research. This process combines a strong relationship with management with third party checks including speaking to customers, competitors, suppliers, and distributors to gain a better understanding of a company’s products and their competitive edge. Key criteria for investment include sizeable revenue and EPS growth prospects, and foreseeable catalysts. Inexpensive valuation is a requirement for all investments, and provides a significant margin of safety on individual stock picks.
