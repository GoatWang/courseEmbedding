Filtration ProductsKeller filters can remove particles down to 1 micron in size, and handle pressures up to 300 psig for both water-based coolants and straight oils.    Magnetic SeparatorsKeller Products offers three distinct magnetic separation lines. All employ 5,000 Gauss rare earth magnets for maximum removal efficiency.    Washable Water FiltersCleaning even the dirtiest of water supplies, Keller’s proprietary washable filters offer excellent flow rates and particle removal down to 50 microns.   Customer Feedback   We installed the first skimmer package on a large Matsuura to check the performance and the results were excellent! The sump was clean, and the oil drained from the Keller skimmer was solid oil. It eliminated coolant waste.Ron M.Facilities Manager at Paramount Machine   “…For a modest investment, the two PFA-1002 units have allowed me to increase shop throughput, avoid unscheduled shutdowns, eliminate parts finish problems, and greatly reduce labor costs for sump maintenance…”Steve D.President and founder of CSI Manufacturing   “I have cut my waste generation from 10 drums per month to two drums per month since I installed the Keller TKO-6 units. In addition, I have increased production by minimizing downtime, which helps us meet our customer deadlines. By removing the tramp oil, my coolant is less likely to foam, and filtering out the aluminum means I am less likely to plug coolant lines in my machines. The Keller units paid for themselves in a few months. I’m glad I kept looking for the right solution to this difficult problem.”Peter J.Manufacturing Manager at Stanfordville Machine   “The magnetic separators are working great. We clean them about every 3 hours or so and have been very pleased with the results.”Jonathan S.A.J. Rose Manufacturing Company   “…The PFA-1002 is rugged and easy to use. It works exactly as described, with neglible operating cost, and has eliminated several costly problems. No more pumping out sumps, no more problems of fines affecting parts finishes, no more short runs with high pressure coolant filter…”Mike C.Marox Corp.Why Keller Products?Keller supplies a family of products which allow machine shops to keep their fluids as clean as possible for as long as possible in the machine tools, reducing coolant consumption and boosting productivity. Keller separators and filters are designed for rugged operation with minimal attention, and Keller provides knowledgeable after-sales support.

Level and Pressure Measurement



















Product CATEGORIES



















OEM Sensors, Transducers, and Transmitters




Keller is the world's largest independent manufacturer of media-isolated, piezoresistive pressure sensors, producing in excess of 1 million units every year. Keller sensors are produced in three basic configurations: gauge pressure sensors, absolute pressure sensors and sealed gauge pressure sensors. Each of these types benefits from over 30 years of continuous development in our ISO9000:2001-accredited headquarters. Optimized mechanical packaging insures effective media isolation without degrading performance. A large percentage of OEM sensors produced by Keller are used in our own pressure transducers and pressure transmitters, so Keller understands the OEM viewpoint. Keller's designs cover a broad spectrum of applications, from medical vascular intervention systems to down hole oil tools. Whatever the requirement, Keller can provide the solution!



 Go to Products







Pressure
        Transmitters






Keller's extensive lineup of pressure sensors, pressure transducers and pressure transmitters includes an extensive selection of above-ground models, all utilizing advanced piezoresistive pressure sensor technology. From general purpose industrial pressure sensors to automotive pressure sensors and transducers to high-flying precision pressure transducers for commercial and military aviation applications, Keller can provide an engineered solution for most pressure measurement problems. Econoline, Valueline and Preciseline transmitters are assembled to order in the US, enabling standard 3-day delivery from our Newport News, VA facility. Other models are produced at our headquarters in Northern Switzerland.



 Go to Products







Submersible Level Transmitters






Keller submersible level transmitters are known for their superior reliability, reasonable cost, and ready availability. They feature small size and integral signal conditioning, simplifying installation anywhere quality liquid level sensors are needed. Most commonly deployed as submersible water level sensors, Keller submersible level transmitters also can be used as tank level gauges. They are frequently paired with a compatible display/control system for use as a general purpose water level indicator or as a water level controller.



 Go to Products







Autonomous
        Water Level Loggers






A perfect marriage of proven pressure sensor technology and advanced microprocessor-based electronics, our DCX family of water level loggers is ideal for shallow or deep well water logging applications. Combining a water level logger with a temperature data logger, these instruments are designed and constructed to provide years of trouble-free service under the most demanding conditions. Data capture is accomplished by periodic data transfer to a laptop or Pocket PC (Windows CE) or, for remote installations, by GSM modem technology. Keller's DCX family of submersible water level and temperature data loggers are up to the task. 



 Go to Products







Digital
        Pressure Gauges






Keller digital pressure gauges (a.k.a. digital manometers) are a cost-effective solution in any pressure monitoring scenario where a local display is required. Features include min/max display, selectable units, 5 kHz scan rate for transient capture and data recording. These Swiss-built instruments are commonly used as fuel pressure gauges, water pressure gauges and oil pressure gauges. Almost any installation previously utilizing mechanical or hydraulic pressure gauges can benefit from an upgrade to Keller technology. Manufactured 100% in-house, Keller products incorporate advanced pressure sensor technology combined with the latest in microprocessor-based electronics, resulting in outstanding performance over a wide temperature range at reasonable cost. Whether troubleshooting hydraulics systems or setting up an air-suspension on a military vehicle, Keller digital pressure gauges make the job easier, and they last!

Digital
        Indicators




A simple pressure measurement system can be configured from a Keller pressure transmitter and one of our digital pressure indicator/power supplies. Our digital indicators are available for operation from DC or AC supply, provide a DC supply to the pressure transmitter and display the transmitter output. The display units can be chosen and scaled according to the specific transmitter in use. Certain models repeat the analog transmitter output and other models accept an RS485 digital output from transmitters so equipped. Also available are models with output relays and high-low alarm capability.

Pressure
        Calibrators




Keller produces many complementary accessories that enhance the usability of our pressure transmitters, including portable pressure calibrators, complete with digital pressure indicators and hand-operated low and high pressure pumps. Available in ranges from vacuum to 700 bar, these calibrators are completely self-contained and can provide power to the transmitter being calibrated, making possible field calibrations in remote locations where power is not available. Specific versions also include a datalogging function, enabling the technician to retain a record of actual data that can be subsequently downloaded and made a part of the permanent calibration record.

Pressure
        Pumps




Among the many complementary accessories that enhance the usability of our pressure measurement products are our low, medium and high pressure pumps. These pumps can be used in conjunction with a secondary standard to provide accurate calibration pressures ranging from vacuum to 700 bar. Low and medium pressure pumps utilize air as the fluid and high pressure versions utilize inert calibration oil. All pumps include a fine adjust feature to enable precise pressure settings.

        Converters




Many Keller pressure transmitters are now offered with modified RS485 digital communication capability. Keller provides several optional interface converters which facilitate the easy startup and use of these transmitters. Converters typically include cabling and in some cases, a transmitter power supply. Converters are available for connection to RS232 serial or USB ports. Versatile software is also included that enables setting the zero point, scaling, readout of temperature as well as pressure and even datalogging and display. Your Keller sales engineer will be pleased to discuss your specific needs regarding our interface converters.
