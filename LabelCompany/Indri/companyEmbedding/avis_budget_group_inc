If, for any reason, you are unable to resolve the issue at the rental location, the next step is to contact our customer service center.
To allow us to provide you with the best possible service, please be prepared to provide our customer service representative with complete details about your rental:

Your contact information, including how you would like us to get back to you(For example, by telephone, in writing via standard mail or electronic mail)

Avis Budget Group


Avis Budget Group, Inc. is the American parent company of Avis Car Rental,[2] Budget Car Rental,[2] Budget Truck Rental, Payless Car Rental, Apex Car Rentals,[3] Maggiore Group[4] and Zipcar.[5] The company's headquarters are located in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States.
As of 2011,[needs update] Avis Budget is the leading general-use vehicle rental company in North America, Australia and New Zealand.[6]
History[edit]
Following the decision to dissolve the Cendant company name and split into four separate companies, the vehicle rental division of Cendant became Avis Budget Group in 2006.[7] At the end of 2008, Avis Budget became the first vehicle rental company to begin deployment RFID transponders in their fleet using a product from TransCore which includes an active RFID tag that can work with nearly all electronic toll collections systems in the United States, including E-ZPass in the Northeast, TxTag (Texas) and SunPass (Florida).[8]
On September 5, 2012, Avis Budget Group acquired Apex Car Rentals of New Zealand. [3][9]
On 14 March 2013 Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar for about US$500 million in cash. Zipcar now operates as a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed, and passed the reins to a new company President, Mark Norman.[10]
On April 9, 2015, Avis Budget Group announced it had completed the acquisition of Maggiore Group, Italy's fourth-largest vehicle rental company.[4][11]

Style Scores:



A Value | B Growth | F Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Avis Budget Group


Avis Budget Group, Inc. is the American parent company of Avis Car Rental,[2] Budget Car Rental,[2] Budget Truck Rental, Payless Car Rental, Apex Car Rentals,[3] Maggiore Group[4] and Zipcar.[5] The company's headquarters are located in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States.
As of 2011,[needs update] Avis Budget is the leading general-use vehicle rental company in North America, Australia and New Zealand.[6]
History[edit]
Following the decision to dissolve the Cendant company name and split into four separate companies, the vehicle rental division of Cendant became Avis Budget Group in 2006.[7] At the end of 2008, Avis Budget became the first vehicle rental company to begin deployment RFID transponders in their fleet using a product from TransCore which includes an active RFID tag that can work with nearly all electronic toll collections systems in the United States, including E-ZPass in the Northeast, TxTag (Texas) and SunPass (Florida).[8]
On September 5, 2012, Avis Budget Group acquired Apex Car Rentals of New Zealand. [3][9]
On 14 March 2013 Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar for about US$500 million in cash. Zipcar now operates as a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed, and passed the reins to a new company President, Mark Norman.[10]
On April 9, 2015, Avis Budget Group announced it had completed the acquisition of Maggiore Group, Italy's fourth-largest vehicle rental company.[4][11]

Avis Budget Group


Avis Budget Group, Inc. is the American parent company of Avis Car Rental,[2] Budget Car Rental,[2] Budget Truck Rental, Payless Car Rental, Apex Car Rentals,[3] Maggiore Group[4] and Zipcar.[5] The company's headquarters are located in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, United States.
As of 2011,[needs update] Avis Budget is the leading general-use vehicle rental company in North America, Australia and New Zealand.[6]
History[edit]
Following the decision to dissolve the Cendant company name and split into four separate companies, the vehicle rental division of Cendant became Avis Budget Group in 2006.[7] At the end of 2008, Avis Budget became the first vehicle rental company to begin deployment RFID transponders in their fleet using a product from TransCore which includes an active RFID tag that can work with nearly all electronic toll collections systems in the United States, including E-ZPass in the Northeast, TxTag (Texas) and SunPass (Florida).[8]
On September 5, 2012, Avis Budget Group acquired Apex Car Rentals of New Zealand. [3][9]
On 14 March 2013 Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar for about US$500 million in cash. Zipcar now operates as a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed, and passed the reins to a new company President, Mark Norman.[10]
On April 9, 2015, Avis Budget Group announced it had completed the acquisition of Maggiore Group, Italy's fourth-largest vehicle rental company.[4][11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
