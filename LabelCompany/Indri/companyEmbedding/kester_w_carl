        W. Carl Kester
	
George Fisher Baker Jr. Professor of Business Administration

 
Print Entire ProfileMore

W. Carl Kester is the George Fisher Baker Jr. Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. A member of the faculty since 1981, he has served as Deputy Dean for Academic Affairs (2006-2010), Chairman of the Finance Unit (2005-2006), and Senior Associate Dean and Chairman of the MBA Program (1999 to 2005). He teaches corporate finance in both the School’s MBA and Executive Education programs.
Professor Kester’s research and course development focuses on international corporate finance and corporate governance. He is the author or co-author of numerous case studies and articles on these topics. More than a million copies of his cases have been sold worldwide. His book, Japanese Takeovers: The Global Contest for Corporate Control, which is a comprehensive field study exploring the Japanese M&A wave of the 1980s and 1990s, was the winner of the O’Melveny & Myers Centennial Grant award. Since 1992, Professor Kester has been a co-editor of the leading volume of finance cases used worldwide, Case Problems in Finance (Irwin/McGraw-Hill), now in its twelfth edition, and Case Problems in International Finance (Irwin/McGraw-Hill). His research has been presented to academic and corporate executive audiences throughout North America, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Among these are the Council on Foreign Relations, the Financial Executives Institute, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, The Strategic Planning Society, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and the World Economic Forum. 
Under Professor Kester's leadership of HBS's academic programs, a new course on leadership, corporate accountability, and business ethics, and another on entrepreneurial management, were introduced into the MBA Program’s first-year required curriculum; the required finance curriculum was redesigned; and the elective curriculum in the Program’s second year was rebalanced and expanded to improve course development opportunities for faculty and course selection options for students. The MD/MBA, MBA/MPP and MBA/MPA-ID joint degree programs between HBS and Harvard Medical School and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, respectively, were also created and launched under his supervision.
In addition to his work at HBS, Professor Kester is currently a member of the Committee to Visit Harvard Medical School and School of Dental Medicine, which reports to the University's Board of Overseers. He has chaired the Harvard University Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, and served on the Harvard University Health Plans Subcommittee, the Harvard University Committee on Calendar Reform, and the Harvard University Employees Credit Union Board of Directors.  Professor Kester is a member of the advisory boards for the IESE Business School of the University of Navarra located in Barcelona, Spain; the IPADE Business School in Mexico City, Mexico; and the international advisory committee for a consortium of business schools in the Andean region: INALDE (Colombia); IDE (Ecuador); and PAD (Peru).
Professor Kester’s consulting activities have involved him with a wide variety of organizations on finance-related topics such as corporate valuation, capital budgeting, real option valuation, and mergers and acquisitions. He has worked with many corporations including J.P. Morgan, IBM, G.E. Capital, Merck & Co., the National Football League, the Standard Chartered Bank, the World Bank, and Xerox Corporation, among others. He is an independent trustee of the BlackRock Closed-End Mutual Funds Complex, which consists of approximately 70 funds with combined assets under management in excess of $45 billion. From 2005 to 2008, he was also an independent trustee of Access Capital Strategies Community Investment Fund, Inc., a closed-end mutual fund that enables financial institutions to invest in loans made in low-income areas in such a way as to qualify for Community Reinvestment Act credits.
Professor Kester currently serves as a Trustee for Bentley University and as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Handel and Haydn Society, a Boston-based musical society featuring an internationally recognized chorus and period instrument orchestra playing historically informed baroque and classical music. He also served as a trustee (1988-2002), and as President of the Board of Trustees (1999-2002), of the Nashoba Brooks School, an independent school for boys and girls (pre-school through grade 3) and girls (grades 4 through 8). As Board President, Professor Kester was responsible for developing the School’s long-range plan, and overseeing the School’s first capital campaign and a major expansion of its facilities.
An economics graduate of Amherst College, Professor Kester also holds advanced degrees from Harvard Business School (MBA), and the London School of Economics and Political Science (M.Sc.). He received his Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard University’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where his doctoral thesis, Growth Options and Investment: A Dynamic Perspective on the Firm’s Allocation of Resources, was the winner of the Advanced Management Program Thesis Fellowship prize. Professor Kester is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Finance Association, and the Financial Management Association.
Professor Kester resides in Concord, Massachusetts with his wife, Jane.  They have three adult children: Kelsey, Eric and Kirsten.

Case Problems in Finance
The leading volume of finance cases used worldwide, Case Problems in Finance presents real business situations that pose debatable alternative courses of action. The cases contain problems that can be narrowed but not always settled by the usual techniques of financial analysis. The cases are grouped by major topics: financial analysis and forecasting, cost of capital, working capital management, capital budgeting, dividend policy, debt policy, financial execution, and mergers and restructuring.



















HBS Case: FX Risk Hedging at EADS
In 2008, EADS, the European aerospace group that owns Airbus, was faced with the decision of how best to hedge a large and growing mismatch between its dollar revenues and its euro manufacturing costs. Specifically, the company needed to decide if it would continue hedging primarily with forward contracts, but in much higher volumes and at increasingly unfavorable rates, or to break with past practice and begin using foreign exchange option contracts. The decision would have consequences for EADS' profitability, cash flow, and its ability to fund strategic investment programs crucial to its ability to remain competitive with Boeing. Students must address questions concerning the proper way to measure foreign exchange exposures, the objectives of a rational risk management policy and program for a company like EADS competing in a duopoly with Boeing, the differences between hedging with FX options versus FX futures, counterparty risk, and hedge accounting, among other considerations.



















Preparing High-Earning Athletes for their Post-Play LIves
The average NFL player makes upwards of a million dollars a year. Even rookies are guaranteed a minimum of $325,000, which is seven times the average starting salary of a college grad. It’s a lot of money, but with the career of an NFL player averaging just three-to-four years, the window for such earnings is small. With this in mind, a few years ago the NFL and the NFL Players Association reached out to a handful America’s top business schools to launch a program that would help prepare players for life after football. Emily Rooney talks to Denver Broncos kicker Steve Hauschka and Harvard Business School Professor Carl Kester, who helped design Harvard’s version of the program and is the director of the NFL Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program.

Alloys

Alloy Temperature Chart
This chart lists the alloys that are available from Kester. Along with the alloys the alloy melting temperature or plastic range is listed. Also listed for each alloy are the forms it is available in.


Alloy Properties
Strength properties of some of the more common alloys. Shear strength, tensile strength and density values for some of the common alloys. Additional alloy properties including information on conductivity, brinell, hardness, elastic modulus, surface tension.

2% Silver
When a silver alloy is recommended. The 2% silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated components/leads. The small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection.

Dross
What is dross? Dross is an oxide that is formed of the tin and lead in the solder. Dross is generated by a combination of heat and agitation. The hotter the solder pot is, the faster the dross is generated. Also, the more agitation the solder sees, the more dross will be formed. A nitrogen blanket will prevent oxygen from reaching the surface of the solder and the dross generation will be greatly diminished or eliminated. There are also chemical dross reducing agents such as the Kester #5744 Dross Eliminator. These chemical compounds react with the tin and lead oxides reducing them back to the base metal and releasing the oxygen to the air. Follow the instructions on the Product Data Sheet when using chemical reducing agents.

Sn60 vs. Sn63
When is the use of one of these two alloys more appropriate than the other? The Sn60Pb40 has a plastic range and puts down a slightly thicker coating of solder. Sn60 is often preferred for lead tinning and other solder coating applications. Sn63Pb37 is eutectic and as such has no plastic range. Generally it flows better than the Sn60 and is the preferred alloy for wave soldering and surface mount applications.

Gold Colored Solder
Assemblers are often concerned when they see a gold color on the surface of a solder pot. The gold color is tin oxide. When the surface of the molten solder is exposed to air it oxidizes and turns gold; sometimes the tin oxide is a purple-blue color. This is normal and can only be prevented by using an anti-oxidant powder or pellet. The discoloration is a cosmetic defect and in no way degrades the reliability of the solder. Kester offers the #5744 Dross eliminator for this purpose.

Flux Residue Removal
Removing No-Clean Flux Residues
Suggestions of how to remove the residues from no-clean fluxes: To remove the residues of no-clean fluxes most solvents will work. The best results are achieved by removing the residues in an aqueous spray cleaner. The spray cleaner can be either a batch type or an in-line type. The addition of a saponifier (Kester # 5768) and hot water, about 130°F will completely remove the flux residues.

Removing Organic Acid (OA) Flux Residues
It is required to remove the residues of OA fluxes? You will get corrosion if you do not fully remove all the flux residues. The flux residues from organic fluxes are hygroscopic, they contain organic acids and they may contain halides. Over time the residues will absorb moisture and the halides will become mobile and corrosive. This will lead to ‘catastrophic failure’ of the assembly in question. We recommend cleaning with an aqueous cleaning system, it can be either batch type or in-line. The water temperature should be between 120-140°F. The important thing is to have lots of rinsing and flushing to completely remove all the flux residues.

Flux Thinning
Soldering fluxes loose solvent and need additions of thinner. Flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base. Over time the solvent evaporates. As the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out. You will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing. A hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity of the flux. Normally the specific gravity (density) is checked 2 or 3 times a day. Thinner is then added to return the flux to its correct density. Hydrometers can be purchased from any scientific supply house. Kester has flux density control Data Sheets (also called nomographs) for the rosin and higher solid content fluxes. Using the nomograph you can determine how much thinner needs to be added. We sell test kits for the low residue fluxes. The test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot.

What Does No-Clean Mean?
There is some apprehension at the description, ‘no-clean’. What does it mean? The flux category called “no-clean” . Many fluxes fall into this category because the flux residues are not harmful to assemblies. It does not mean there will be no residues. All fluxes leave residues (the solids are the active portion of the flux that does all the work). Some flux residues are conductive or corrosive and must be removed. Other fluxes like the no-clean fluxes leave residues that do not need to be removed.

Flux Test Kit
The PS-20 and PS-22 test kits are used for flux control of low residue(no-clean) fluxes. The PS-20 and PS-22 test kits are acid titration kits. As solvent evaporates, the acids in the flux become more and more concentrated. The kit is used to determine the acid number of the flux. The test is a simple drop test with an indicator for the endpoint (similar to a swimming pool test). You count the drops and then go to a chart. From the chart you determine how much thinner to add to bring the acid number back down to spec. Traditionally flux control is maintained by measuring the density of the flux and adding thinner as the flux thickens. This is a good method for fluxes with high solids contents. A slight change in density corresponds to a small change in the flux. The no-clean fluxes have low solids percents (typically 2 or 3 %) so a small change in the flux density could reflect the change in solids of 25-30%. This would put the acid level unacceptably high. The test kits are more accurate than using density measurements as a way to monitor the flux.

Rosin Flux
Saponification
Saponifiers in an aqueous cleaner can be used to remove rosin flux residues. What the Bio-Kleen #5768 saponifier does is react with the outside layer of flux and soften it up, lLiterally turning it into a soap. You need a spray cleaner so that this soap layer will be washed away which then allows the Bio-Kleen to react with the next layer. Rinse that layer off, etc. The problem with ultrasonic removal is that the outer layer is slightly dissolved and that is the end of the reaction. In the meantime the solder is being exposed to an alkaline condition. The exposed solder turns a dull gray as the surface shine is etched off by the caustic solution.

Thinner Calculation
A calculation that can be used to determine how much thinner needs to be added to the flux to maintain a specified specific gravity. The following formula can be used to determine how much Kester # 4662 thinner to add to the Kester # 2235 flux to bring it back to the recommended specific gravity (density). For your information this formula can be used for any Kester flux that utilizes the # 4662 thinner. V = ( x – y ) 128 Y – 0.783 Where V = ounces of # 4662 thinner to be added per gallon of flux. X = present flux density Y = desired flux density For example: The flux is at 0.875 and it should be at 0.856 V = ( 0.875-0.856 ) 128 or V = 2.432 or V = 33.3 ounces of thinner per gallon of flux 0.856 – 0.783 .073

Storage of Flammable Materials
Most rosin fluxes are flammable materials. This is a general guide to storage of flammable materials. Kester does not have a required temperature and humidity for storage of flammable liquid chemicals. From a safety standpoint we recommend storage at room temperature and humidity. For flammable materials we recommend storage in an approved flammable materials storage cabinet. Storage above normal room temperature can be risky as the material (alcohol) will build up pressure in the container. There is a risk the material will spew out of the container when opened.

Flux Thinning
Soldering fluxes lose solvent and need additions of thinner. Flux is composed of solids dissolved in a solvent base. Over time the solvent evaporates. As the solvent evaporates the solids concentrate and eventually crystallize out. You will need to add thinner on a regular basis to prevent the flux from crystallizing.

We sell test kits for the low residue fluxes. The test kits indicate how much thinner to add to the flux pot.

Rosin Flux Removal
Do rosin flux residues need to be removed? Rosin flux residues are non-conductive and non-corrosive. Under normal circumstances they do not have to be removed from a printed circuit assembly. Rosin residue removal would be for cosmetic considerations. In an environment where the working temperature of the assembly will exceed 200°F the rosin residues will melt and become conductive, in these situations flux removal is required.

Process Information
Syringable Paste Needle Size
Syringable solder paste requires a needle and plunger for application.  The 100 g paste comes in a standard 30cc. syringe. 35 g samples come in a standard 10 cc syringe. Most distributors carry plungers and needles. Scientific supply companies such as Fisher Scientific (www.fishersci.com) and Cole Parmer (www.coleparmer.com) also carry plungers and needles. For dispensing SMT solder paste a 20 gauge needle is the smallest that is usable.

Solderability

Soldering to gold
When soldering to a gold plated surface the thickness of the gold is important. If the gold is thicker than 40-50 micro-inches, the solder most likely may not dissolve all the gold and bond to it. The solder will be dull looking and, if the gold content in the solder exceeds about 5%, the solder joint will be brittle. If the gold is thin, less than 20 micro-inches, it easily dissolves into the solder, making the solder joint look grainy. If the metal that was under the gold is not oxidized, the gold-contaminated solder will bond to it. However, as gold plates usually in a columnar structure, the gold should be at least 10 micro-inches thick to protect the base metal (in most cases nickel) from oxidation.

2% Silver
When is a silver alloy is recommended? The 2% silver is required when soldering to silver or silver plated components/leads. The small percent of silver in the solder prevents the silver on the leads from migrating into the solder resulting in a weak or brittle solder connection.

Soldering to Aluminum
Aluminum is an extremely difficult metal to solder to. Kester does not have any products for soldering to aluminum.

Soldering Thermocouple Wires
Thermocouple materials are not solderable. It is possible to surround the thermocouple wire (encapsulate it) with solder but you cannot make a metallurgical bond to it. It is important to note that even if you could solder the two wires back together the thermocouple still will not work. A thermocouple works by measuring the change in resistance of the two dissimilar metals joined in the welded bead. If one were to join the metals with a solder inter-connect the thermocouple would give meaningless numbers. The way to fix a broken thermocouple is to re-weld the thermocouple bead. If you wish to attach a thermocouple to a printed circuit board for reflow profiling, you can use a high temperature alloy to encapsulate it or use a cyano-acrylate adhesive to stick it to the board.

Maxum Petroleum, Inc.
W. Carl Kester
Maxum seeks an oil-price hedging strategy that yields substantial cash during oil price spikes, is affordable under ordinary circumstances, and is easily managed. It is striving to avoid a repeat of the challenging situation encountered in 2008 when spiking oil prices resulted in substantial working capital buildup, heavy draw down in its bank credit lines, and missed investment opportunities. Students must differentiate among the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow effects of Maxum's exposure to oil prices, and understand the payoff profiles of various option hedges such as call writing and buying, costless collars, and "ratio writing" (unequal combinations of puts and calls).  They are also challenged to design a hedging program that supports Maxum's growth and investment strategy by yielding substantial cash primarily during extreme oil price increases; imposes low or no costs otherwise; and does not require active, judgmental trading decisions to execute.

The Galaxy Dividend Income Growth Fund's Option Investment Strategies
W. Carl Kester
This case is designed to provide an elementary introduction to options and option pricing for beginning finance students. Analysis of the case requires students to compare the prices of put and call options with various exercise prices and maturity dates on two equities (JPMorgan Chase and Facebook) that had identical closing stock prices on January 14, 2014 but very different volatilities. These common features and differences enable students to do a series of static comparisons that reveal the impact of a change in one determinant of an option's price while holding other factors constant. The business setting involves a mutual fund board considering the initiation of an option trading strategy to enhance the risk-adjusted performance of the fund and, through covered call writing, to increase earned income that can be used to support cash dividend distributions. Although the administrative situation is fictional, the data contained in the case are real. The case is best positioned at the beginning of a course module on derivatives and risk management.
