Postdoctoral Alumni - Christoph Bausch  





 


 


Christoph Bausch
					Director, Biorefined Products
					POET, Sioux Falls, South Dakota
					 
In 2002 Christoph Bausch had just earned a PhD in Microbiology at The Ohio State University and was, by his own admission, broke,  but also newly married and excited to start a career surrounded by “rock star” science.
Raised on a farm in Nebraska, Bausch was eager to soak up new technologies. So after searching for cutting-edge venues in the heartland, he landed an interview with Stowers Associate Investigator Jennifer Gerton, then a new faculty member.
“When I walked into Stowers I thought, ‘Wow, this could be a fantastic place to work!’” says Bausch. “After my interview I knew I could go after projects that required creativity. I wanted to be innovative, and Jennifer let me test myself.”
Bausch spent until 2006 as Gerton’s first postdoc. There he used yeast as a model organism to characterize cohesins, the protein complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. That work earned Bausch a 2007 publication in Molecular and Cellular Biology. But his most prized moments were brainstorming sessions with Stowers technical support staff.
“I loved hanging out with the array people until three in morning,” he says, citing Research Advisor Chris Seidel as an influential mentor. At that time emerging microarray technology was the frequent topic of late-night tech sessions, and Bausch credits innovative climate at Stowers with pushing him toward biotechnology. “Without Stowers I would not be where I am today. They gave me the freedom to identify my technical passion with science..”
In 2006 Bausch become an R & D scientist at Sigma-Aldrich in St. Louis where he applied what he learned at Stowers to set up a microarray system to analyze and improve the production of biopharmaceuticals. More midnight discussions followed at Sigma, this time with the business development team, who convinced Bausch to join their side of the company while he simultaneously earned an MBA at St. Louis University in 2011.
				In 2012 Bausch left Sigma to become director of biorefined products at POET, one of the world’s largest producer of ethanol and biorefined products in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Although he serves on the board of directors of the two companies he founded in St. Louis, his job at POET is to develop strategies and scout for novel technologies to commercialize new bio-based products and materials. And when he’s not doing that, Bausch, ever the Midwesterner, relishes his leisure time in Sioux Falls, the “pheasant-hunting capital of the world.”

Weatherford International plc announces the appointment of Mr. Christoph Bausch as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective December 13, 2016.  Bringing many years of financial and operational management experience, Mr. Bausch joined the Company in May of 2016 as Vice President and Controller Product Lines.  Previous to his tenure at Weatherford, and since May of 2011, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial officer of Archer Limited, an oilfield services company publicly traded in Norway on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Before his role at Archer Limited, Mr. Bausch served as a Global Finance Director of Transocean, after having a 20-year international career with Schlumberger, where he held senior financial positions in global and regional capacities in the U.S., the U.A.E., France, Mexico, Venezuela and Germany across a number of business segments covering operations, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain. Mr. Bausch holds an M.B.A.  degree (“Diplom Kaufmann”) from the University of Mannheim, Germany.
Also effective December 13, 2016, Mr. Frederico Justus has been promoted to the position of President – Regional Operations.  Mr. Justus joined Weatherford in 2010 and, since May 2015, was Vice President of the Middle East and Africa region.  He has over 19 years of oilfield experience across the entire services industry, which includes managing multiple environments and product lines spanning several countries.  Mr. Justus is a mechanical and industrial engineer with a degree from the Federal Technical University of Parana, Brazil.  His appointment comes as Weatherford’s current President – Regional Operations, Mr. Antony J. Branch, leaves the Company. Weatherford is grateful for Mr. Branch’s leadership and contributions over the years.
Both Mr. Bausch and Mr. Justus will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
Commenting on the management appointments, Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Krishna Shivram stated “Christoph’s previous experience as a public company CFO, his financial expertise, depth of knowledge in the oil and gas industry as well as leadership capabilities will further help strengthen our focus on financial discipline, cash flow generation and improved cost efficiencies.  In addition, we are confident that Frederico, in his new role of President – Regional Operations, with his successful track record and many years of direct hands-on experience will have a positive impact and help us reach our objectives and build a stronger Company.  The future is full of opportunity for Weatherford, and I very much look forward to working with both Christoph and Frederico to take our company to the next level.”
