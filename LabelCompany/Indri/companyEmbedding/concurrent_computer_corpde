Fully Featured Entry Level Video-on-Demand and Live-Streaming Solutions for Cable Operators ATLANTA, July 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Concurrent (NASDAQ:CCUR), a global leader in storage, protection, transformation and delivery of visual assets, introduces today its new Media Delivery Springboard solutions, a cost-effective means for small and medium-sized independent cable operators to ingest, store, transform and deliver video-on-demand (VOD) and live-streaming content.   Traditional content delivery networks come with high start-up costs, which present a challenge for small and mid-size operators that may lack the necessary capital to invest in large-scale infrastructure. Concurrent's new Media Delivery Springboard helps independent cable operators with smaller budgets and limited resources remain competitive with an entry-level video delivery solution requiring minimal infrastructure investment.    There are three options available, including a VOD solution for QAM-based set-top boxes, a VOD and live-streaming solution for IP devices and a content delivery network solution that supports both QAM and IP devices. Each one offers comprehensive services and provides the ability to scale as capacity requirements grow. "The Media Delivery Springboard provides unparalleled value for independent cable operators without compromising on quality," said Scott Ryan, Concurrent's Sr. Vice President of Products and Chief Marketing Officer. "We're proud to equip these operators with a premium-grade revenue-generating platform for the advanced services their customers desire."              The solutions provide a seamless migration path for increasing services and storage as operator subscriber bases grow. Embedded content adaptation features such as Just-In-Time Packaging, dynamic DRM encapsulation, and manifest manipulation provide video service operators a feature-rich solution with uncompromising performance, scale and multi-service capabilities. Media Delivery Springboard is fully supported by Concurrent's 24/7 support team and software troubleshooting capabilities, including application logging for key events and remote support for troubleshooting, maintenance and software upgrades. About Concurrent Concurrent (NASDAQ:CCUR) is a global software and solutions company that develops advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering high value media assets. We serve industries and customers that demand uncompromising performance, reliability and flexibility to gain a competitive edge, drive meaningful growth and confidently deliver best-in-class solutions that enrich the lives of millions of people around the world every day.

Fully Featured Entry Level Video-on-Demand and Live-Streaming Solutions for Cable Operators ATLANTA, July 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Concurrent (NASDAQ:CCUR), a global leader in storage, protection, transformation and delivery of visual assets, introduces today its new Media Delivery Springboard solutions, a cost-effective means for small and medium-sized independent cable operators to ingest, store, transform and deliver video-on-demand (VOD) and live-streaming content.   Traditional content delivery networks come with high start-up costs, which present a challenge for small and mid-size operators that may lack the necessary capital to invest in large-scale infrastructure. Concurrent's new Media Delivery Springboard helps independent cable operators with smaller budgets and limited resources remain competitive with an entry-level video delivery solution requiring minimal infrastructure investment.    There are three options available, including a VOD solution for QAM-based set-top boxes, a VOD and live-streaming solution for IP devices and a content delivery network solution that supports both QAM and IP devices. Each one offers comprehensive services and provides the ability to scale as capacity requirements grow. "The Media Delivery Springboard provides unparalleled value for independent cable operators without compromising on quality," said Scott Ryan, Concurrent's Sr. Vice President of Products and Chief Marketing Officer. "We're proud to equip these operators with a premium-grade revenue-generating platform for the advanced services their customers desire."              The solutions provide a seamless migration path for increasing services and storage as operator subscriber bases grow. Embedded content adaptation features such as Just-In-Time Packaging, dynamic DRM encapsulation, and manifest manipulation provide video service operators a feature-rich solution with uncompromising performance, scale and multi-service capabilities. Media Delivery Springboard is fully supported by Concurrent's 24/7 support team and software troubleshooting capabilities, including application logging for key events and remote support for troubleshooting, maintenance and software upgrades.

                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Concurrent Computer Shares Plunge                
Shares of the Concurrent Computer Corporation, which makes computers and software for video-on-demand services, fell as much as 31 percent yesterday after the company lowered forecasts. The stock ended the day down 52 cents, or nearly 19 percent, to $2.23. It had fallen 63 percent in the last year. Concurrent blamed order delays, slower start-ups for some video-on-demand services and price cuts by rivals. Video-on-demand sales will be $7.5 million to $9.5 million, instead of the $12 million to $14 million the company forecast in January. The company yesterday forecast a loss, excluding some potential costs for writing down an investment, of 5 cents or 6 cents a share in the quarter ending March 31. The company, which is based in Duluth, Ga., had predicted it would break even or have a loss of as much as 2 cents. Analysts expected the company to break even, according to a Thomson Financial survey. Concurrent, whose largest customers are AOL Time Warner, Cox Communications and Lockheed-Martin, forecasts total sales of $16.5 million to $18.5 million after predicting as much as $23.5 million. Net income was 4 cents a share on sales of $25 million in the quarter a year ago.

COMPANY NEWS

                    TWO COMPUTER COMPANIES TO MERGE IN STOCK DEAL                
Two companies that specialize in "real time" computing -- the Concurrent Computer Corporation and the Harris Computer Systems Corporation -- said yesterday that they would merge in a stock deal. Harris Computer's shareholders would receive 9.56 shares of Concurrent for each share they own. There are about 2 million shares of Harris Computer outstanding. Shares of Concurrent, based in Oceanport, N.J., fell 3.125 cents, to $1.50, and shares of Harris Computer climbed 37.5 cents, to $13.125. After the merger Concurrent's shareowners will hold 61 percent of the combined company. The two companies, which are expected to have combined revenues of $170 million, produce computers for specialized needs -- like military or commercial simulations -- that require quick response and reliability.

History of Concurrent Computer Corporation








Concurrent Computer Corporation is a global supplier of high performa nce computer systems. The company has been a pioneer in the field of real-time computing and parallel processing. Formed in the 1960s to s erve the scientific and engineering market, Concurrent has expanded i ts reach to the financial and medical administration industries. Its hardware and software powers a wide variety of applications including video-on-demand, process control, data acquisition, and simulators. Leading products include the MediaHawk video-on-demand and RedHawk, a Linux-based, real-time processing system. The company is active in m ore than 30 countries.

Origins

Interdata, Inc. was established in 1966 by former IBM engineer Daniel Sinnott and others. A pioneer in the minicomputer industry, Interdat a focused on the technical market and was turning a profit by the end of the decade.
In 1974 Perkin-Elmer Corporation, a Norwalk, Connecticut producer of scientific instruments, optics, and semiconductor manufacturing equip ment, acquired Interdata Communications Inc. for $63.6 million. B y this time, Interdata had annual sales of $19 million; Perkin-El mer's were about 12 times greater. Interdata soon moved into a new he adquarters in Oceanport, New Jersey.
Later in the decade, Interdata underwent a management shift and focus ed on the high end of the market for 32-bit minicomputers, which incl uded applications in flight simulation, seismic analysis for the ener gy industry, and transaction processing for the financial services in dustry, noted the New York Times.

Interdata claimed the first full 32-bit computer in 1974. The company then became a proponent of the parallel processing approach to numbe r crunching, wherein multiple tasks were performed at once, rather th an one by one as in serial processing. This made real-time computing a possibility, with a plethora of applications in business and other markets.
The Interdata name was lost as the company became the basis for Perki n-Elmer's Data Systems Group. The business had a bad year in 1982 and underwent some cost-cutting before the parent company decided to spi n it off.

Spun Off in 1985

Concurrent Computer Corporation (formerly Interdata) became an indepe ndent company in November 1985. Its initial public offering on the NA SDAQ raised $37 million; Perkin-Elmer retained about 80 percent o f equity.
Concurrent soon entered a partnership with Nippon Steel Corp. to deve lop a presence in Japan. However, the newly independent company was e xperiencing a difficult start. A nine-month product delay of a new &# 36;1 million parallel processing system compounded the company's trou bles in a slow market. Sales slipped 7 percent to $244.8 million as profits were halved to $6 million in the company's first year of independence.
Perceiving a market shift towards cheaper open systems, in October 19 88 Concurrent merged with Massachusetts Computer Corp. (Masscomp), a $76 million producer of UNIX-based microcomputers whose equipment had been used in the Space Shuttle program. Though smaller, Masscomp was the surviving entity, and changed its name to Concurrent. The de al cost Masscomp $240 million, two-thirds of it borrowed.
The original Concurrent had about 2,800 employees then, four times as many as Masscomp. James K. Sims, the president and CEO of the origin al Concurrent, also headed the merged company. He had originally join ed Interdata in 1974 as a sales representative.








The newly combined company had the ambition of becoming number one in the real-time computing market. However, in spite of unique tax adva ntages, some cost savings from layoffs, and a leading position in the $5 billion real-time systems market, there were signs of danger from the beginning.

Early 1990s Debt Crisis

Sales were about $300 million in 1990. Concurrent went through so me hard times in the early 1990s as defense spending fell. A new CEO, former Penn Central Industries Group Inc. head Denis Brown, arrived in September 1990 just as the company was going into default on its h eavy debt from the Masscomp merger. There were reportedly also consid erable corporate culture differences to overcome after moving Masscom p production to Concurrent's New Jersey facility, leading to a signif icant delay in a new UNIX product.
To put the company back on track, Brown stalled with the company's le nders and bondholders (some of which, including the Bank of New Engla nd and a couple of troubled thrifts, were facing insolvency themselve s) while letting go of more than a quarter of Concurrent's 3,200-stro ng workforce and cutting back on research and development and real es tate. (Company CFO James P. McCloskey discussed the contentious finan cial negotiations in some detail with American Banker in early 1992.)
Revenues were down to $222 million by fiscal 1992. Brown was look ing for growth from more advanced battlefield simulators as well as a new line of administrative products for hospitals. Concurrent had sa les of $179 million in 1994. It would soon grow with a major acqu isition, the purchase of the rival real-time business of Harris Corpo ration in 1996.
This business had been formed in 1967 as Datacraft. Harris bought it in the early 1970s and renamed it the Harris Computer Systems Divisio n. It was spun off as Harris Computer Systems Corp. in 1994. In June 1996, Concurrent acquired the spinoff's $40 million-a-year real-t ime computer business in a stock swap worth $30 million. (Harris Computer Systems was subsequently renamed CyberGuard Corp. after its remaining firewall product.) Concurrent had previously rebuffed an of fer to itself be acquired by Harris Computer.
Concurrent introduced its MediaHawk Video Server in 1998. This soon b ecame the basis for video-on-demand services from several leading cab le operators. It could also provide streaming content for distance le arning, video conferencing, and in-flight entertainment.

New Home in 1999

In 1999 Concurrent relocated its headquarters to the Atlanta area, wh ich was also the site of its new video-on-demand (VOD) division, dubb ed XStreme. The Integrated Solutions unit remained in Fort Lauderdale . (Concurrent later did away with the divisional structure a few year s later.) Also in 1999, Concurrent acquired a competitor in VOD serve rs, Vivid Technologies of Chalfont, Pennsylvania.
The company soon claimed the leading position in the emerging broadba nd video-on-demand market. VOD business with cable operators as far a way as Asia accounted for $12 million of the company's fiscal 200 0 sales ($68 million). By fiscal 2002, VOD revenues had quadruple d, and accounted for more than half the company's total sales of &#36 ;89 million.
Concurrent was also maintaining its legacy real-time computing busine ss. It was involved with the Aegis radar system that monitored threat s for the Navy. The company was beginning to outfit Navy ships entire ly with UNIX-based, COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology.
In 2005, Concurrent was acquiring Cleveland's Everstream Holdings in a stock swap worth $15 million. Everstream, formed in 1999, produ ced business intelligence software. The two companies had been involv ed in a VOD advertising joint venture.
