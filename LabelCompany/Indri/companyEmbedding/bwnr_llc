What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Registration Statement on
Form S-3
Relating to an Aggregate $500,000,000
Offering Price and/or Principal Amount of Securities






Ladies and
Gentlemen:


     We have acted as
counsel to Resolute Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(“ Resolute ”), Hicks Acquisition Company I,
Inc., a Delaware corporation, Resolute Aneth, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, Resolute Natural Resources Company, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company, Resolute Wyoming, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, BWNR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, WYNR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and
Resolute Northern Rockies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (collectively, the “ Guarantors ”), in
connection with the registration by Resolute and the Guarantors
pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the “
Registration Statement ”) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “ Act ”), of an aggregate
$500,000,000 offering price and/or principal amount, as applicable,
of (i) senior and/or subordinate debt securities of Resolute
(together, the “ Debt Securities ”)
(ii) shares of Resolute common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (the “ Common Stock ”), (iii) shares
of Resolute preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“ Preferred Stock ”), (iv) warrants to
purchase any of the Debt Securities, Common Stock or Preferred
Stock (the “ Warrants ”), (v) guarantees of
Debt Securities by the Guarantors (the “ Guarantees
”), (vi) rights to purchase Common Stock, Preferred
Stock, and/or Debt Securities (the “ Rights ”),
(vii) units consisting of two or more securities (the “
Units ”), and (vii) depositary shares (the
“ Depositary Shares ”). The Debt Securities,
Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Warrants, Guarantees, Rights, Units
and Depositary Shares are referred to collectively herein as the
“ Securities .”


     The Debt
Securities will be issued from time to time either in whole or in
part under one or more indentures (each, an “
Indenture ”), each of which will be between Resolute
and a trustee to be named in a supplement
(“Supplement”) to the prospectus (the “
Prospectus ”) included in the Registration Statement,
and, if applicable, one or more Guarantors as guarantors with
respect to such Debt Securities. Any Securities will be issued
pursuant to a Supplement to the Indenture pursuant to which the
corresponding Securities are issued. The Warrants will be issued
under one or more warrant agreements between Resolute and a banking
institution organized under the laws of the United States or
one

of the states
thereof (each, a “ Warrant Agreement ”). The
Rights will be issued under one or more rights agreements between
Resolute and a bank or trust company as rights agent (each, a
“ Rights Agreement ”). The Depositary Shares
will be issued under one or more deposit agreements between
Resolute and a bank or trust company as depositary (each, a “
Depositary Agreement ”).


     We have examined
and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate
records and other instruments, have made such inquiries as to
questions of fact of officers and representatives of Resolute and
the Guarantors, and have made such examinations of law as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of giving the opinion
expressed below. In such examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, and the conformity with the originals
of all documents submitted to us as copies.


     We have assumed
for purposes of this opinion (i) the corporate power,
authority and legal right of the trustees under the Indentures, the
banking institutions under the Warrant Agreements, the rights
agents under the Rights Agreements, and the banks or trust
companies under the Depositary Agreements to execute, deliver and
perform their obligations under the Indenture, Warrant Agreement,
Rights Agreement, or Depositary Agreement, as applicable, that the
performance of such obligations by any such trustee, banking
institution, rights agent, bank, or trust company will not violate
its charter or by-laws, or applicable organizational documents, and
that the trustee, banking institution, rights agent, bank, or trust
company has the legal ability to exercise their purported powers in
the State of Colorado, (ii) that the Indentures, Warrant
Agreements, Rights Agreements, and Depositary Agreements will have
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the trustee,
banking institution, rights agent, bank, or trust company at the
time of issuance of the Debt Securities, Warrants, Rights, or
Depositary Shares, as applicable, (iii) that the aggregate number
of shares of Resolute which would be outstanding after the issuance
or reservation for issuance of the Securities, and any other
contemporaneously issued or reserved Common Stock or Preferred
Stock, together with the number of Common Stock and Preferred Stock
previously issued and outstanding and the number of shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock previously reserved for issuance
upon the conversion or exchange of other securities issued by
Resolute does not exceed the number of then authorized shares of
Resolute.


     The opinions
herein are limited to matters governed by the federal laws of the
United States of America and the laws of the State of Colorado, the
Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act, including the provisions of the Delaware Constitution
and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such law. Except
as expressly stated above, we express no opinion with respect to
any other law of the state of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction.


     Based upon and
subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and
assumptions set

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
