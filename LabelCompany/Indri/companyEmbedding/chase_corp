About Us
Founded in 1946 we have grown to become a  leading manufacturer of industrial coatings and tapes for high reliability  applications with a global customer base operating in diverse market sectors.
 Today we employ nearly 700 people and continue  to grow and strengthen our business through employing a related diversification  strategy that combines organic growth initiatives with strategic acquisitions.
 Based in Westwood, Massachusetts, USA we  operate manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia and  continue to invest in our capabilities in order to deliver the value our global  customer base demands.
Timeline
1940s– Chase Corporation founded in Randolph, Massachusetts, USA by  Francis G. Chase and his two sons, Francis M. and Edward L. Chase. The original  name of the company was Chase & Sons, Inc. and its first product was a  rubber baby pant worn over traditional cloth diapers.
 1950s – Development of the Chase & Sons product line of insulating, binding and  bedding tapes for the wire and cable industry utilizing the company's original  expertise in rubberized coatings. The Chase & Sons product line remains the  industry standard for quality and reliability.
 1960s – Organic growth in wire and cable along with strategic  partnership investments in related businesses.
1970s – Chase Corporation became a public company through the  reverse merger transaction with Columbia Technical Corporation. The Company's  name changed to Columbia Chase Corporation (Boston Stock Exchange: CTE).  Columbia Technical developed the HumiSeal line of conformal coatings for the  electronics industry. Columbia Chase went on to acquire the Royston  Laboratories business from Jack Royston.
 1980s – Retirement of the Company's founders and emergence of  new leadership team. A corporate restructuring occurred throughout the latter  part of the decade with the Company changing its name from Columbia Chase  Corporation to Chase Corporation and the divestiture of non-core businesses.
 1990s – The Company focused on growing its core tapes and  coatings businesses: Chase & Sons (Wire and Cable), HumiSeal (Electronic Coatings), Royston (Construction – Pipeline Coatings). Diversification into Electronic  Manufacturing Services.
 2000s – Continued focus on core businesses with globalization  and related diversification initiatives through various acquisitions and  partnership agreements. Consolidation of management and operations. Sale of the  Electronic Manufacturing Services business and continued investments in core  protective materials businesses.
 2010s – Continued growth  through both acquisitions and selective organic growth, with a focus on operational  consolidation. Three recent significant investments (NEPTCO, Henkel’s Specialty  Chemical Intermediates, and Resin Designs)

Chase Corporation Acquires Specialty Chemical Product Lines


Bridgewater, MA – February 2, 2015 – Chase Corporation (NYSE MKT: CCF) announced that it has acquired two product lines from Henkel Corporation, a leading global manufacturer of adhesives with North America Operations headquartered in Rocky Hill, CT. The businesses were acquired for a purchase price of $33.3 million, excluding any working capital adjustments and acquisition related costs. As part of this transaction, Chase is acquiring Henkel’s Microspheres business, sold under the Dualite® brand, located in Greenville, SC, as well as obtaining exclusive distribution rights and intellectual property related to Henkel’s Polyurethane Dispersions Intermediates business, currently operating in the Elgin, IL location. The purchase was funded entirely with available cash on hand.
Adam P. Chase, President and Chief Operating Officer, commented,
“We are excited by the addition of specialty chemical product technologies that enable the efficient use of resources, reduce carbon footprint and improve worker safety. The Dualite brand is a great addition to the Chase portfolio.
“Chemical intermediates are building-block raw materials used by formulators to enhance their own products. This acquisition fits well with our strategic intent to broaden our Specialty Chemical expertise.”
Thermoplastic microspheres and water-based polyurethane dispersions offer unique product technologies that add value to customer applications. These “green” technologies provide development solutions that can be optimized for reducing energy and water usage, greenhouse gasses, and overall processing cost.
Dualite polymeric microspheres provide a unique value proposition via lowering material costs, weight reduction, density reduction and sound dampening focusing a spotlight on “lightweighting,” resulting in enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.
Water-based polyurethane dispersions are a rapidly growing segment of the specialty chemicals industry. Polyurethane polymers have traditionally exhibited high toughness, versatility and wide range of superior properties, such as abrasion resistance, impact strength and low temperature flexibility, which are the driving forces to their continuously expanding usage in many applications. Waterborne dispersion technology allows ease of formulation, application and cleanup as well as environmental advantages such as the elimination of monomers, odor and reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOC).
The ChemQuest Group, Cincinnati, OH, a leading specialty chemicals consulting firm, advised Chase on this acquisition and provided critical guidance, analysis and insight into the strategic development, direction and execution of this exciting new platform initiative.

Timeline
1940s– Chase Corporation founded in Randoph, Massachusetts, USA by Francis G. Chase and his two sons, Francis M. and Edward L. Chase. The original name of the company was Chase & Sons, Inc. and its first product was a rubber baby pant worn over traditional cloth diapers.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.
