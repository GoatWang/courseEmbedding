 Investment Process | Greenwood Gearhart












































































 







































 Investment Process

 










Greenwood Gearhart believes optimal investment management resides at the intersection of sound Economic Analysis, Security Analysis, and Portfolio Management.
Our time-tested approach considers each factor as part of the investment process. The resulting portfolios are built to stand the test of time.

 WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN AN INVESTMENT






Attractive Valuation

Fair to undervalued companies based on normalized earnings or asset values.

 


Well Financed

Strong balance sheet with ready access to the capital markets.

 


Shareholder Friendly

Long-term track record of acting in the best interests of – and returning capital to – shareholders.

 


Competitively Advantaged

Possess competitive advantages – or “moat” – that are difficult to replicate.

 


Favorable Industries

Operate in industries with favorable cyclical or structural characteristics, barriers to entry, and/or exposure to demographic
mega-trends.

 


Capital Allocation

Deliberate management focus on optimizing capital allocation.

Investment & Risk













Investment is placing capital at risk with the expectation of a gain, but the possibility of a loss.
Risk is the uncertainty of the outcome & measures the probability that the outcome is a loss, rather than a gain.
Because risk & return are positively correlated, the Investment Advisor’s responsibility is to assume risk intelligently on behalf of the client.
Investment Advisors mitigate risk through research to increase the knowledge of specific investments and through diversification to spread risk among investment opportunities.

What We Do | Greenwood Gearhart













































































 







































What We Do

 




Professional investment advice provides strength, stability and clear direction in the complex task of portfolio management.
When personal wealth grows or retirement is on the horizon, selecting the right investment advisor is important to your future. Greenwood Gearharts’ long-term investment approach focuses on customized portfolio design. We manage each portfolio in a manner consistent with the client’s investment objectives.

 OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES





A Firm Designed with the Client at the Center of Everything.

 


We Work for You

Our focus is squarely on your interests. We have no Wall Street parent company, quarterly profit targets, sales goals, or shareholders. Legally, we must act as fiduciaries, and in your best interests before ours.

 


Alignment of Interests

Our personal investments are invested alongside yours, providing for directly aligned interests. We are not salesmen, our compensation is directly tied to your success, not to the sale of products.

 


Transparency to Fees, Risks & Outcomes

As an alternative to difficult-to-decipher brokerage statements and hidden fees, you receive clear, concise fee and portfolio statements. You know what you own and what you pay.

 


Responsible Service

Your questions are paramount and our answers are timely and accurate. As a boutique firm, we seek to add value to the relationship in the way we serve you.

 


Dedication

While you spend time accumulating assets, we spend time growing them, filtering through hundreds of investments each year to find the best long-term, value-based opportunities for your (and our) portfolio

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
