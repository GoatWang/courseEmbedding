					Goodyear Leadership 


Richard J. Kramer

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company













Rich Kramer is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.  He became CEO in 2010 and was elected Chairman by Goodyear’s Board of Directors later the same year.
Kramer’s appointment as CEO culminated a steady rise through the company in a series of key leadership roles over the course of a decade. After joining Goodyear in 2000 as vice president of corporate finance, he served as vice president of finance for the company’s North America business from 2002 to 2003.   
As executive vice president and chief financial officer from 2004 to 2007, Kramer led the successful effort to restructure Goodyear’s debt and improve the company’s capital structure.
He was named president of Goodyear North America in 2007 and guided the company’s largest business through the global recession and positioned it for sustained profitability in the years that followed.  In 2009, Kramer assumed additional responsibility as Chief Operating Officer prior to his appointment as CEO the following year. 
Before joining Goodyear, he was a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he spent 13 years including a three-year assignment based in Paris, France.
Born in Cleveland, Kramer attended John Carroll University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration in 1986.  He remains active as a JCU alumni and has served on the school’s Board of Trustees since 2007.  Kramer also is engaged in community leadership roles with the Akron Regional Chamber of Commerce and Akron Tomorrow.  He currently is on the board of directors for The Sherwin-Williams Company and is a member of The Business Council.

In my case, I was involved in an unfortunate accident that, at the time I believe I was going lose two fingers on my left hand. They were in pretty bad shape. I was fortunate to have Dr Chan perform what I now see as a miracle. Face with the prospect prospect of losing part of your hand is depressing. I remember getting the bandage changed for the first time,  anticipating the results of the surgery.. It was just before Christmas 2016. Dr. Chan said they look pretty good. They did. I truly felt I had unwrapped the best Christmas present I have ever received (barring the Birth of my Sons).Eric Chan MDIsaac C. ratedDr. Chan helped remove a tumor like cyst/lump  on my left parotid gland and I was so happy with the result. I followed Dr. Chan's advise and had the whole parotid gland removed so now I have the peace of mind that it won't turn cancerous in the future.During the surgery Dr. Chan was friendly and he did his best to comfort me by chatting with me.  The surgery was totally painless.  The only pain was the psychological pressure before the surgery from myself.  I highly recommend Dr. Chan.C Cabaccan Joselito MDJackie T. ratedDr. Cabaccan is amazing. I will say that he's usually late on his appointments, but when he's yours, HE'S YOURS. He is thorough, focused, knowledgeable and compassionate - among other things. It's hard to find a really good endocrinologist and I've seen many. With an HX of thyroid cancer, you want to feel comfortable that your doctor knows his/her stuff - and this one definitely does. I will travel the globe to have him remain my endo until I die!Kanel Jeffrey Mdwendyh. ratedThank you so much for the amazing work you’ve done for our precious autumn. We are so grateful for all the time you spent with us explaining options and helping us to make the best decisions for her, amazing work and fantastic care! We are so thankful for your phenomenal care.Britz, Marie B MDgeorgeharris ratedWe've only been to see Dr. Bri...It was a good experience.We've only been to see Dr. Britz once so far but it was a good experience. She's very knowledgeable and friendly dermatologist. She patiently answered all of my questions. I would highly recommend her. Their receptionist is very helpful too.Kanel Jeffrey Mdkristym. ratedThank you very much for fixing my broken leg. I am running, jumping, swimming, and doing all of the things that two year old's lone to do. My whole family is so happy with your wonderful work, and I’m so happy to be me again. Thanks for making me all better!Eric Chan MDJeffrey A. ratedDr. Eric S. Chan, MD Helped me to heal my cut leg after Good Samaritan didn't completely close my wound with stitches , stitches came out , not heavy enough thread. Dr. Eric S. Chan, MD Taught me how to heal this type of wound and it's healed ����Kanel Jeffrey MdGeorge B. ratedI’m so excited about being able to run soon and one day play sports again. But the only reason I will be able to do that is because you fixed me. Thank you! You have been a great doctor and I’m very thankful for what you’ve done. Thanks!!!Rosalinda Mandreza MDKeyanna H. ratedDr officeI'm very happy pleased with Dr and staff but it is a hassle to get them on phone. My pharmacy has sent request for medicine refills and I have to call in order them so I can get a refill done. David DR Erickson DDSSelva N. ratedDr. Erikson is our family dentist.  He and his staff are excellent.  They do everything to make going to the dentist a pleasant experience.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Kramer, Richard J
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Kramer, Richard J carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Kramer, Richard J



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Kramer, Richard J



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
