	Item 1.01




	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.







	Sixth Supplemental Indenture




	On January 12, 2017, Boardwalk Pipelines, LP (the Boardwalk Pipelines), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline
	Partners, LP a Delaware limited partnership (Partnership), completed its offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.450% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the Notes) which are fully and unconditionally
	guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Partnership.


	The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of August 21,
	2009 (the Base Indenture), between Boardwalk Pipelines, as issuer, the Partnership, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee (the Trustee), as amended and supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental
	Indenture, dated January 12, 2017 (the Sixth Supplemental Indenture and together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture). A copy of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and is
	incorporated by reference herein.


	Interest on the Notes will be payable in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year they
	are outstanding, beginning on July 15, 2017. Boardwalk Pipelines may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to April 15, 2027 at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
	redeemed or the make whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Boardwalk Pipelines may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after April 15,
	2027 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.


	The Indenture contains covenants that will limit the ability of Boardwalk Pipelines, and its subsidiaries to, among other things, create
	liens, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, sell assets or merge with other entities. The Indenture does not restrict Boardwalk Pipelines or its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, paying distributions on its equity interests or
	purchasing or redeeming their equity interests, nor does it require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition, the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would require Boardwalk
	Pipelines to repurchase or redeem or otherwise modify the terms of the Notes upon a change in control or other events involving Boardwalk Pipelines. Events of default under the Indenture include (i) a default in the payment of principal of the
	Notes or, following a period of 30 days, of interest, (ii) a breach of Boardwalk Pipelines covenants or warranties under the Indenture or the Partnerships under its guarantee, (iii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
	liquidation involving Boardwalk Pipelines, the Partnership or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture) and (iv) any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness of Boardwalk Pipelines, the Partnership or any subsidiary of
	Boardwalk Pipelines if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50.0 million.

	provided

	,

	covenant contained in this

	Section




	 4.11

	shall not apply to, and there shall be excluded from Attributable Debt in any computation under this

	Section




	 4.11

	, Attributable Debt with respect to any Sale

	Notwithstanding these restrictions on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, the
	Issuer and its Subsidiaries may enter into, create, assume and suffer to exist Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, not otherwise permitted hereby, if at the time of, and after giving effect to, such Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, the total
	consolidated Attributable Debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, together with mortgages incurred pursuant to

	Section 4.10(y)

	Capitalized terms used herein shall

	1.

	Interest

	. Boardwalk
	Pipelines, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the 


	Partnership


	 or the 


	Issuer


	), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at 4.450% per annum until maturity. The Issuer shall pay
	interest semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each such year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each an 


	Interest Payment Date


	). Interest on the Notes shall accrue
	from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from January 12, 2017;

	provided

	that if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a
	record date referred to on the face hereof and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date;

	provided

	,

	further

	, that the first Interest Payment Date shall be
	July 15, 2017. The Issuer shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at the same rate, and it shall pay interest
	(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at the same rate to the extent lawful. Interest shall be
	computed on the basis of a

	360-day

	year of twelve

	30-day

	months.


	2.

	Method of Payment

	. The Issuer shall pay interest on the Notes (except Defaulted Interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders
	of Notes at the close of business on the


	 


	 





	2

	 



	To be included only if the Note is issued in global form.





	 


	Exhibit A-3






	January 1 or July 1 next preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in
	Section 2.16 of the Original Indenture with respect to Defaulted Interest, and the Issuer shall pay principal (and premium, if any) of the Notes upon surrender thereof to the Trustee or a paying agent on or after the Stated Maturity thereof.
	The Notes shall be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for such purpose (which initially is 2 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1020, Chicago, Illinois 60602), or, at the option of the
	Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the Debt Security Register or by wire transfer to accounts designated by the Holders;

	provided

	that payment by wire transfer of immediately
	available funds shall be required with respect to principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on each Global Security. Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for
	payment of public and private debts.


	3.

	Paying Agent and Registrar

	. Initially, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.,
	the Trustee under the Indenture, shall act as paying agent and Registrar. The Issuer may change any paying agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Partnership may act in any such capacity.


	4.

	Indenture

	. The Issuer issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of August 21, 2009 (the 


	Original
	Indenture


	), as amended and supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 12, 2017 (the 


	Sixth Supplemental Indenture,


	 and, together with the Original Indenture, the
	


	Indenture


	), each between the Issuer, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, as guarantor (together with its successors, the 


	Guarantor


	), and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the
	Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S. Code §§ 77aaa-77bbbb). The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act for
	a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling. The Notes are the obligation of the Issuer and the
	Guarantor, initially in aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Issuer may issue an unlimited aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes under the Indenture. Any such Additional Notes that are actually issued shall be treated as
	issued and Outstanding Notes (and as the same series (with identical terms other than with respect to the issue date, issue price and first payment of interest) as the initial Notes for the purposes indicated in Section 3.02 of the Sixth
	Supplemental Indenture).


	5.

	Optional Redemption

	.


	(a) At its option, the Issuer at any time prior to the Par Call Date, may choose to redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at
	once or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such Notes and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon that would have
	been due if the Notes matured on the Par Call Date (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a

	360-day

	year consisting of twelve

	30-day

	months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 35 basis points, plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive
	interest due on the relevant interest payment date).


	(b) At its option, the Issuer at any time on or after the Par Call
	Date, may choose to redeem all or any portion of the Notes, at once or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date (subject to the
	right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).


	 


	Exhibit A-4






	For purposes of determining the redemption price, the following definitions shall apply:


	


	Comparable Treasury Issue


	 means the U.S. Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment
	Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed (assuming, for this purpose, that the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in
	accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed (assuming, for this purpose, that the Notes matured on the Par Call Date).


	


	Comparable Treasury Price


	 means, for any Redemption Date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer
	Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations or (2) if the Issuer obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.


	


	Independent Investment Banker


	 means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Issuer.


	


	Reference Treasury Dealers


	 means each of Barclays Capital Inc., Mizuho Securities USA Inc., a Primary Treasury
	Dealer selected by MUFG Securities Americas Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or an affiliate or successor of the foregoing, and,
	at the Issuers option, additional Primary Treasury Dealers (as defined below);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a 


	Primary
	Treasury Dealer


	), the Issuer shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.


	


	Reference Treasury
	Dealer Quotations


	 means, for each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Issuer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its
	principal amount) quoted in writing to the Issuer by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such Redemption Date.


	


	Treasury Rate


	 means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent
	yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.


	 


	Exhibit A-5






	6.

	Mandatory Redemption

	. The Issuer shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or
	sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes or to repurchase them at the option of the Holders.


	7.

	Notice of Redemption

	.
	Notice of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail (or, in the case of Global Securities, transmitted electronically) at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its
	registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed. On and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue
	on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption and with respect to which the redemption price has been paid.


	8.

	Denominations,
	Transfer, Exchange

	. The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided in the
	Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and the Issuer may require a Holder to pay any taxes or other governmental charges imposed in relation
	thereto.


	9.

	Persons Deemed Owners

	. The registered Holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes.


	10.

	Amendment, Supplement and Waiver

	. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended or supplemented with the consent of
	the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes, and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture relating to the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of
	not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes. Without the consent of any Holder of a Note, the Indenture may be amended or supplemented for any of the purposes set forth in Section 9.01 of the Indenture,
	including to provide for the assumption of the Issuers obligations to Holders of the Notes in case of a merger or consolidation of the Issuer or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuers assets, to add to the covenants of the
	Issuer or any Guarantor, to cure any ambiguity or omission or to correct any defect or inconsistency, to permit the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, to add or reflect the release of Guarantors pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, to
	make any change that does not adversely affect the rights under the Indenture of any Holder of the Notes, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the Indenture in respect of one or more series of Debt Securities in certain
	circumstances, to evidence or provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture of a successor or separate Trustee or to establish the form or terms of any other series of Debt Securities.


	11.

	Defaults and Remedies

	. Each of the following constitutes an Event of Default with respect to the Notes: (i) default in the
	payment of any installment of interest upon the Notes as and when due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; (ii) default in the payment of all or any part of the principal on any of the Notes as and when the same
	shall become due and payable either at Stated Maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or the Guarantor in respect of the Notes (other
	than a covenant or


	 


	Exhibit A-6






	agreement in respect of the Notes a default in the performance of which or the breach of which is elsewhere in Section 6.01 of the Indenture specifically dealt with) and continuance of such
	default or breach for a period of 60 days (or 180 days in the case of a Reporting Failure) after there has been given to the Issuer and the Guarantor by the Trustee or to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in
	aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a 


	Notice of Default


	 hereunder; (iv) certain events
	of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Issuer or, if and so long as the Notes are guaranteed by a Guarantor, such Guarantor; (v) any Guarantee ceasing to be in full force and effect (except as otherwise provided in the
	Indenture), being declared in any judicial proceeding to be null and void, or being denied or disaffirmed by the applicable Guarantor; and (vi) either (1) default in the payment of any Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary
	of the Issuer after the expiration of any applicable grace period after final maturity or (2) the acceleration of Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Issuer by the holders thereof because of a default and, in
	either case, the total amount of the Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $50 million;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the occurrence of any of the events described in clause (iii) above shall not constitute an Event of Default
	if such occurrence is the result of changes in generally accepted accounting principles as recognized by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants at the date as of which the Sixth Supplemental Indenture is executed and a certificate to
	such effect is delivered to the Trustee by the Issuers independent public accountants.


	If any Event of Default, other than one
	described in clause (iv) above, occurs and is continuing, then, unless the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate
	principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, then in each and every such
	case, unless the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes shall have already become due and payable, the principal of and interest on all the Notes shall become due and payable immediately, without further action or notice.


	Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of not less
	than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default (except a Default relating
	to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest) if the Trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the Holders interests. The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
	Outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, the
	principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes or an Event of Default relating to a provision of the Indenture that cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected thereby. The Partnership is required to deliver to the Trustee
	annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Partnership is required within 30 days after it becomes aware of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or
	Event of Default and certain additional information.

	12.

	Authentication

	. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual
	signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.


	13.

	Abbreviations

	. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a
	Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).


	14.

	CUSIP and ISIN Numbers

	. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification
	Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP and corresponding ISIN numbers to be printed on the Notes, and the Trustee may use CUSIP and corresponding ISIN numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the
	accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.


	The Issuer shall furnish to any Holder upon written request and without charge a copy of the Indenture. Requests may be made to:

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP is an energy company based in Houston, Texas. It is a master limited partnership operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) industry, primarily providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk owns approximately 14,365 miles (23,118 km) of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having aggregate capacity of approximately 205 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and 24.0 million barrels (MMbbls) of NGLs. Boardwalk's pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas and extends north and east to the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and Boardwalk's NGLs pipeline and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk's common units are traded under the symbol "BWP" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The general partner for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners is Boardwalk GP, LP, which is indirectly owned by Loews Corporation for 100 percent. The common units, class B and general partner interest indirectly owned by Loews Corporation represent approximately 53 percent of the equity interests, excluding the incentive distribution rights.
Operations[edit]
Boardwalk serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk provides a significant portion of pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which customers pay monthly capacity reservation charges (which are charges owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization). Other charges are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges under firm contracts, approximately 12% of revenues were derived from charges based on actual utilization under firm contracts and approximately 7% of revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.
Boardwalk has the following operating subsidiaries:

Texas Gas Transmission, LLC
Gulf South Pipeline Pipeline Company, LP
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC
Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC
Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC
Boardwalk Field Services, LLC

History[edit]
Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merges into Gulf South in 2015. In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana. In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline ethylene pipeline system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers. Boardwalk Field Services, LLC develops and operates gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, and processing infrastructure, and in June 2013 placed its processing plant into service.
Governance[edit]
The current members of the board of directors for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP are William R. Cordes, Stanley C. Horton, Thomas E. Hyland, Arthur L. Rebell, Peter W. Keegan, Mark L. Shapiro, Kenneth I. Siegel and Andrew H. Tish.

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP is an energy company based in Houston, Texas. It is a master limited partnership operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) industry, primarily providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk owns approximately 14,365 miles (23,118 km) of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having aggregate capacity of approximately 205 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and 24.0 million barrels (MMbbls) of NGLs. Boardwalk's pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas and extends north and east to the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and Boardwalk's NGLs pipeline and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk's common units are traded under the symbol "BWP" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The general partner for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners is Boardwalk GP, LP, which is indirectly owned by Loews Corporation for 100 percent. The common units, class B and general partner interest indirectly owned by Loews Corporation represent approximately 53 percent of the equity interests, excluding the incentive distribution rights.
Operations[edit]
Boardwalk serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk provides a significant portion of pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which customers pay monthly capacity reservation charges (which are charges owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization). Other charges are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges under firm contracts, approximately 12% of revenues were derived from charges based on actual utilization under firm contracts and approximately 7% of revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.
Boardwalk has the following operating subsidiaries:

Texas Gas Transmission, LLC
Gulf South Pipeline Pipeline Company, LP
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC
Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC
Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC
Boardwalk Field Services, LLC

History[edit]
Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merges into Gulf South in 2015. In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana. In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline ethylene pipeline system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers. Boardwalk Field Services, LLC develops and operates gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, and processing infrastructure, and in June 2013 placed its processing plant into service.
Governance[edit]
The current members of the board of directors for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP are William R. Cordes, Stanley C. Horton, Thomas E. Hyland, Arthur L. Rebell, Peter W. Keegan, Mark L. Shapiro, Kenneth I. Siegel and Andrew H. Tish.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
