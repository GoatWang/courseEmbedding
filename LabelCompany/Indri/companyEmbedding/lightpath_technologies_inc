					Full Description



LightPath Technologies, Inc., incorporated on June 15, 1992, is a manufacturer and integrator of families of precision molded aspheric optics, fiber-optic collimator, GRADIUM glass lenses and other optical materials used to produce products that manipulate light. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and distributes optical components and assemblies utilizing the optical processes and manufacturing technologies. The Company also performs research and development for optical solutions for the traditional optics markets and communications markets. The Company's products are incorporated into a range of applications by its customers in various industries, including defense products, medical devices, laser aided industrial tools, automotive safety applications, barcode scanners, optical data storage, hybrid fiber coax datacom, telecommunications, machine vision and sensors.The Company is evaluating its business based on five product groups: low volume precision molded optics (LVPMO), high volume precision molded optics (HVPMO), specialty products, infrared products and non-recurring engineering (NRE). The LVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics, which is sold in smaller lot quantities. The HVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics, which is sold in larger lot quantities. The infrared product group consists of both molded lens and assemblies. The specialty product group consists of various products, such as optical subsystems, assemblies, GRADIUM lenses and isolators. The NRE product group consists of those products it develops pursuant to product development agreements it enter into with customers. The Company is serving various markets, such as distribution and catalog, laser, industrial, instrumentation, telecommunications and defense.Low Volume Precision Molded Optics and High Volume Precision Molded Optics Product GroupsThe Company's glass molding technology enables the production of both low and high volumes of aspheric optics. The Company's products, precision molded optical lenses, are used as a component in optical communication networks. The Company's LVPMOs are used in a range of market applications, such as medical endoscopes, medical flow cytometers, scientific and bench-top lasers, laser based spectrometers, military telecommunications and telescopic weapon sights. The Company's HVPMOs are used in a range of market applications supporting the laser diode applications for high volume markets in laser tools, range finders, laser gun sights, bar code scanners and micro-projectors.Infrared Product GroupThe Company's molded infrared optics technology enables high performance infrared aspheric lenses that do not rely on traditional diamond turning or lengthy polishing methods. Utilizing precision molded aspheric optics reduces the number of lenses required for thermal imaging systems and the cost to manufacture these lenses, as well as the size of the lens system. The infrared optics molding process allows lenses to be manufactured in high volume with a repeatable, consistent performance and allows for beam shaping or achromatization over a range of wavelengths to be molded directly into the surfaces of the lens. The Company's infrared systems, includes thermal imaging cameras, gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver awareness systems, such as blind spot detection, thermal weapon gun sights and infrared counter measure systems. The Company's aspheric molding process is an enabling technology for the cost reduction and commercialization of infrared imaging systems because the aspheric shape of its lenses enables system designers to reduce the lens element in a system and provide similar performance at a lower cost.Specialty Product GroupThe Company's GRADIUM glass is an optical glass material with axially varying refractive index, capable of reducing optical aberrations inherent in conventional lenses and performing with a single lens tasks performed by multi-element, conventional lens systems. Its applications include surgical lasers, high power yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) lasers for welding, cutting and marking, defense-market uses, and test and measurement. GRADIUM has a capability to handle over 10 kilowatts of power and is servicing a market for laser high-power cutting and laser welding. The Company designs, builds and sells optical assemblies into markets for test and measurement, medical devices, military, industrial and communications based on its technologies.The Company competes with Asia Optical, Anteryon, RPO, Sunny Optics, Panasonic, ALP's, Hoya Corporation, E-pin Optical Industry Co., Kinik Company, Janos Technologies, Ophir Optics, Elcan Optical Technologies, Asphericon, Umicore, Kiro, Free Form and Edmund Optics.
