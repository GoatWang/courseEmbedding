Top positive reviewSee all 74 positive reviews› 4.0 out of 5 starsWell done, great characters, high quality writing and a plot that seems familiar and recycled but definitely isn't.ByJTon November 9, 2014This was a great twist on the usual spy thriller genre that I enjoy.  A former CIA agent, flawed in so many ways, you think you have read about this character before...but you haven't.No, not a grizzled old veteran of the spy game off to ensure justice in some secret mission from the POTUS.  Nope, not a superstar-ninja-cannot be defeated by any means FBI agent seeking justice for some unsolved crime.This may have had some "standard" character and plot ideas, but the heroine is far from your standard spy thriller fare.  She's flawed, she makes mistakes, but what keeps her from being just another cliche ex CIA agent is the great character Jordan has created.  First, just the simple fact that she's a she.  Then the pertinent fact that she doesn't *always* win.  Finally, the great writing that creates the character and draws you in slowly, patiently, all the while building not to a climax regarding the supposed mystery happening around her, but the full on resolution of just how she came to be who she is.I won't do any spoiler alerts, but you will be surprised when the plot twists.  Usually, if you are a fan of spy thrillers like myself, you can predict the "twist" by the second chapter.Never saw this one coming.

3.0 out of 5 starsA novel with good characters, but boringByBill Garrisonon August 31, 2013David Jordan James' FORSAKEN is a Christian drama that starts out thrilling and suspenseful, but turns into a character driven story about faith and the choices a person must make. Taken together the two elements don't work well together. I wish the author had been more consistent with genre.Taylor Pasbury is a 29 year old former secret service agent who now runs a nationally recognized security firm. The novel opens with a tragic event occurred when she was 18, and shaped her life for the next several years. The author then tells us of Taylor's habits of drinking a lot and sleeping around. It made for an interesting character, but wasn't as powerful as it could have been, because it was told, and not shown.Simon Mason is a world famous evangelist who fills arenas everywhere and has the heart of Billy Graham. He hires Taylor to be his own security consultant, and her first night on the job, tragedy strikes. That event shakes Simon's life, and his faith.Unfortunately, for the rest of the novel, nothing really happens. There is the hint of characters forming bonds but nothing really happens. Taylor makes moves to get past the demons that haunt her. Simon battles his faith...and well that's it. I wish there had been more character development and twists, but that all happens at the end of the novel, and by then it is too late.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsLost me half way through the book.ByBoyMomx3on May 6, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI got the Kindle version of Forsaken, and I am glad I did not pay more than $1.99 for it, it just was not worth it. The book's plot idea was captivating for the first half and then it died. The author then slowly builds up another plot only to again end it really quickly. It should have been two seperate books, neither plot got a chance to become fully developed. I also felt that some of the way the author dealt with faith issues were wishy-washy at best, and intially I would have rated this book a one, but he redeemed himself in the end. Great ideas, just a very disjointed ride.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Or keep our faith and our child would live.  It makes one think deeply. I have thought about these things before, and have to remember that those kind of people would be very evil, and therefore could not be trusted to let the child or whoever live. We are to put our love in God first, before our loved ones, hard, yes but we would be together in the end, in a glorious place. This story is well put together, and is meant to make us think: what would we do? Yes, I would recommend this book to others, I am now looking for another one from this author.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA Page-TurnerByLou Annon October 21, 2012Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseFORSAKEN by James David Jordan is an exciting book, definitely a page-turner. Taylor is the daughter of a Special Forces officer, and she takes after her dad. The story opens with a memorable 17th birthday camping trip. Eleven years later, Taylor has worked for the Secret Service in Washington, D.C. and she has more experience (of all kinds) under her belt than most people have in a lifetime. She has started her own security company back home in Texas. Evangelist Simon Mason calls and asks her to head up his security team. Taylor goes for the interview, and she starts the most scary adventure of her whole career. It includes crazies and Islamic terrorists as well as personal secrets and blackmail. The evangelist has to face the hardest choice of all. This book is well-written. It moves fast. I personally would like to have seen a stronger biblical testimony from Simon, although there is some. (Had I written the book, I would have changed the plot in the most crucial part of the book.) Without being a spoiler, I can say that the ending was exactly as it should have been, and I loved it. A good book, entertaining, and well-written. If you are looking for a page-turner, this is it.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

She isn't a believer and doesn't trust televangelists. He has been receiving threats from Muslim extremists.  As she works with him she realizes that he is the real deal. She practically becomes a part of his family. They help her to overcome her demons. A story of redemption but not preachy.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

I just love to read. I only write a review if I think a book is an outstanding read and Forsaken definitely fits that category.  It is action-packed and moves quickly (no slow spots).  You will not be able to put it down, but you will also not be able to quit thinking about it afterwards. In the book, Simon Mason, the televangelist, has to make an agonizing decision.  I have asked myself everyday since reading it what I would have done if I had been in that situation.  I didn't want the book to end and I hope that Jordan is leaving the door open for book 2.An enjoyable book is one that you enjoy while leisurely reading it, even though you know you probably won't remember a lot about it in a couple of months.  That is not Forsaken.  It is outstanding!!  It is my new favorite book and Jordan is my new favorite author!  Book lovers, you will not be disappointed with Forsaken.P.S. If you like Forsaken, read Jordan's first book, Something That Lasts.  It is totally different than Forsaken, but equally outstanding.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

If you enjoy books with surprises, especially with people standing firm in their faith through all of it--read this. Yes, there's action because Simon has risen from being an assembly-line worker to being a world-known evangelist and he is under threat because of his stance. The action comes as a result of those threats. What a security chief he is chosen--what twists you will experience at the end of this book.  Read this; I couldn't put it down. I am currently reading the sequel. You will be blessed!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Product Description▼▲
When Simon Mason, the world's best-known televangelist, receives threats from Muslim terrorists, he hires beautiful former Secret Service agent Taylor Pasbury to take charge of his security. Taylor is thrilled to receive the high-profile assignment, but she has no idea that Simon already knows more about her than she could imagine. When the terrorists strike, making a demand of the pastor that would shake the most steadfast saint, Taylor draws on all of her hard-knock toughness and training as she fights to save Simon and his daughter. Along the way, she discovers that she is not the only one who has done things she would like to forget--and she is not the only one who understands that some things are more important than living.

An intimate exploration of the soul’s need for acceptance and belonging, it touches the nerves of some of our most sensitive fears and longings. Forsaken is a moving and relevant saga of faith on a collision course with the brutalities of our world."—Jill Elizabeth Nelson, author of Reluctant Burglar and Reluctant Smuggler "Entertaining, action packed, and thought provoking. I couldn’t put it down. Forsaken is a must read."—Patricia Rushford, author of Deadly Aim and As Good as Dead"With more twists and turns than a rip-roaring rollercoaster ride, Forsaken will keep you guessing right to final page. You’ll find no easy answers here but many to consider."—Ken Abraham, New York Times bestselling author"I have read many enthralling suspense novels, meaningful love stories, and books that challenged my thinking and purpose, but never has a novel combined all three elements with such adeptness as Forsaken." —RelzReviews


Author Bio▼▲
James David Jordan is a business attorney in Texas and was named by the Dallas Business Journal as one of the most influential leaders in that legal community. He holds a journalism degree from the University of Missouri as well as a law degree and MBA from the University of Illinois and lives with his wife and two teenage children in the Dallas suburbs. Forsaken is his second novel.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
Raised by her father, a Special Forces veteran, Taylor always knew she was different.  Practical rather than perfect, beautiful yet unaffected with a plethora of survival skills most adults never master, Taylors soul is still scarred when evil comes calling on her.  As a result, Taylor throws herself in to her studies and into a career protecting others, with a tenacity and ferocity rarely seen in a woman. Taylor serves her country well, despite controversy, in the Secret Service before opening her own Security company, Pasbury Security.
Under pressure from his devoted staff, following threats from Muslim extremists, Simon Mason, the worlds most revered televangelist reluctantly agrees to a security detail and handpicks Taylor Pasbury.  Fighting an attraction to this surprisingly understated man, Taylor implements security changes but is unable to prevent Simons daughter Kacey from kidnappers who demand Simon make an unthinkable choice if he wants to see Kacey again.
Simon, Taylor and Kacey find themselves caught up in life threatening events that may exact a price higher than death.
I have read many enthralling suspense novels, enjoyed meaningful love stories and delved into books that challenge my thinking and purpose but never has a novel combined all three elements, and with such adeptness, as Forsaken.  David James Jordans Taylor Pasbury is a complex woman with burdens from her past, unimaginable to most, yet is genuinely intriguing.  Simon Mason is a man who wields great power yet is grounded in his beliefs and compassion, but still has demons from his past to battle.  When the unbearable testing of his soul and spirit occurs, you will not be left untouched and as I did, will contemplate the choice you might make in Simons shoes.  Although the conclusion is satisfying, I was left feeling there was a depth to the characters that remained unexplored so I was thrilled to learn Taylors story does not end with this book.  A fascinating and emotional read, Forsaken will keep you up late, even when the last page is read, pondering your faith, the intricacies of love in all its forms and Gods unforseen purposes in this world.
Truth be told, regardless of the challenging thoughts it leaves you with, Forsaken is one excellent ride, complete with unexpected twists and turns, that neither men or women should miss! - RelzReviews
James David Jordan pens a fascinating tale that is more than a suspense novel. An intimate exploration of the souls need for acceptance and belonging, it touches the nerves of some of our most sensitive fears and longings. Forsaken is a moving and relevant saga of faith on a collision course with the brutalities of our world. - Jill Elizabeth Nelson,
Author of Reluctant Burglar and Reluctant Smuggler 
Entertaining, action packed, and thought provoking. I couldnt put it down. Forsaken is a must read. - Patricia Rushford, Author of Deadly Aim and As Good as Dead 
With more twists and turns than a rip-roaring rollercoaster ride, Forsaken will keep you guessing right to final page. Youll find no easy answers here but many to consider. - Ken Abraham, New York Times bestselling author
Dallas/Fort Worth, TXWhat would it take for you to renounce your faith in Christ?  Author James David Jordan confronts readers with this challenging question in his new book, Forsaken (B&H Publishing Group, October 2008).  A unique love story wrapped in an action thriller, Forsaken is the first of a two-book series featuring Taylor Pasbury, a beautiful but troubled former Secret Service agent hired by the worlds most famous televangelist after he receives terrorist threats.  Even as a high school kid, Taylor Pasbury knew that she was not like most other girls.  Raised by a father who was a retired Special Forces officer, she grew up knowing how to camp, fish, shoot, and most of all, take care of herself.  As a young adult she opens her own security agency following a controversial stint as the nations most celebrated Secret Service agent.  When Simon Mason, the best known Christian on the planet, receives threats from Muslim terrorists, he hires Taylor to take charge of his security.  Though Taylor is thrilled to receive the high-profile assignment, she has no idea that Simon already knows more about her than she could possibly imagine.   Before Taylors first day on the job is over, the terrorists strike, making a nightmarish demand that requires Simon to choose between the two most important things in his life.  Drawing on all of her hard-knock toughness and training, Taylor must face deadly extremists and a dark past as she fights to save Simon and his daughter.  Along the way, she discovers that she is not the only one who has done things she would like to forgetand she is not the only one who understands that some things are more important than living.  James David Jordan is a successful business attorney in Dallas, Texas.  Though many lawyers have the urge to write, few actually submit to the daunting task of slogging through the creation of a manuscript.  James, however, followed his aspirations to become an author, taking five years to create his first book, Something That Lasts, which was well-received by both critics and the public. 
Forsaken is written with James same passionate purposeto entertain readers with page-turning stories while encouraging them to explore and grow in their faith.  I wanted to present readers with a spiritual dilemma that parents can only hope they will never face, James says.  What if you had to choose between God and your own child?  Would God really require you to prove your love by allowing your child to die?  With gripping authenticity, James examines this thought-provoking subject of family and faith and skillfully draws readers into the crisis faced by Simon Mason.  Will he forsake his faith in front of millions to save his daughters life?  Would you? - Wire52.com and on societyandreligion.com
Not your grandma's safe Christian fiction
Taylor is a former secret service agent who's been called to protect the world's most famous televangelist. She's had a past that calls for her to take this job very seriously. Simon has received threats from terrorists telling him to step down from his ministry or else him and his family will be in harm's way. When the unthinkable happens, Simon has to make a choice that will change everyone who has been affected by him forever. 
Reading this book was like watching an episode of 24 in book format. This book was heart thumping non stop action from the first page. It's very gritty, not for the faint hearted. I love how the main character is a female who doesn't need to rely on others to take care of herself. Reading about Taylor's past and how it affected her life and career choice was great buildup for the story. This is honestly one of the best suspense novels I have ever read, in both secular and Christian fiction. With plot twists and good character development, this book was hard to put down. The story is very realistic, one could easily see the news headlines actually happening. It's actually scary to think that there could be someone out there who is plotting this exact scenario. 
The choice that Simon had to make was extremely difficult. It is a situation that one hopes NEVER to have to be in. It really makes you think about what is the most important thing in your life and exactly how strong your faith really is. The ending is rather interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing how that storyline is played out. I'm highly anticipating the next book in the series. This is one book that you could easily pass on to guys who claim to hate reading. It will definitely grab their attention. HIGHLY recommended.-

Simon Mason is not your average world-famous evangelist. A down-to-earth everyman, his rapid ascent to household name surprised him more than anyone else. After being informed that his name is popping up in terrorist circles as a target, he employs Taylor Pasbury - an unusual woman in her own right - to provide security services for him.
Taylor is barely on the job when her past Secret Service training is called into action. Masons daughter Kacey, the jewel of his life, has been kidnapped. The terrorists demand? Forsake Christ. Deny that He is the Son of the living God. Then we will return your daughter. Placed in a situation that few of us will ever be called to face, Mason must make a life-shattering decision that will change his life forever.
While Forsaken sounds at first glance like a typical terrorist/suspense novel, it is so much more than what it seems. Well deserving of the suspense genre label, it moves at an intense and engrossing pace through the first two-thirds of the book, only to slow into a more thoughtful, reflective later portion. Readers are treated to what amounts to two stories within one cover, skillfully blended. A tale of nerve-wracking uncertainty and action combined with the story of one mans faith and spiritual journey.
Jordans novel enthralled me. Forsaken possesses a special quality that refuses to let the reader set the book down for long. Far from being rote, the story of Kaceys capture and the difficult decision her father faced were captivating. The characters are realistic, flawed and uncommonly personable. Mason is true to life in his vulnerability, failings and foibles. Pasbury, a woman with a difficult, tainted past is gritty, wounded, and loveable. The author has succeeded in writing both male and female characters that resonate in the heart of the reader.
Exploring far more than the themes of inter-religious tensions and terrorism, Jordan dips his characters into loneliness, evangelism, love, the bonds of family and Gods grace. A surprising depth is created through the drawing together of seemingly disparate threads of story - the lines between past and present. 
Jordan does introduce some threads that are left dangling by this storys end. Readers looking for a single title read may feel disappointed that these avenues have been left open. Those looking forward to future adventures with Taylor Pasbury will be delighted by the prospect of a sequel. Double-Cross is scheduled for release in October 2009.
A balanced perspective on the actions of Muslim terrorist groups is also woven into this novel. Far from condemning all followers of Islam as dangerous radicals, it is made clear that the purpose of such radicals is rarely religious, but more often power based. Moderate followers of Islam are treated with respect and dignity without minimizing the need to share the gospel with them.
Certainly a well-written suspense novel, Forsaken is so much more than I expected; deeper, truer, touching and surprising. Come for the thrill, adrenaline and addictive compulsion to keep reading. Stay for the lingering reflection, insight and first steps on the path to healing. - http://quiverfullfamily.com/2008/10/17/book-review-forsaken-by-james-david-jordan/ 
When terrorists kidnap Simon's daughter they make one demand Deny Christ and get your daughter back. But doing so will have consequences far beyond the kidnapping for celebrity preacher Simon, his daughter Kacey and Simon's security, Taylor. The kidnapping is only the beginning of unfolding events and discoveries that lead Taylor to discover that even Christians are flawed. But will she see beyond the mistakes to the Savior Simon serves? 
Beyond mystery/suspense, FORSAKEN probes the heart of man, explores the meaning faith and takes us to the heart of a God of forgiveness and peace. Hard to put down. - http://idealinhope.com/bookreviews/fiction.html
Forsaken is told in first person by Taylor Pasbury, daughter of Special Forces veteran and single father Roger Pasbury. We learn that Taylors mom fell apart and left for good when Taylor was nine years old. Her dad taught her all about self-defense, shooting, camping, and fishing. On her 17th birthday she and her dad embark on a camping trip but run into two strangers who want to have their way with Taylor. Before they can, Taylors dad is murdered and Taylor kills the two strangers. 
Several years later after a stint with the Secret Service which she left with both a decoration for bravery and a somewhat salty reputation, Taylor operates her own security business. Spending too many nights alone or drunk in the arms of strangers, she is surprised by the invitation of the Best-known Christian on the Planet Simon Mason to meet with him about providing security since he has received death threats. 
Simon Mason was just another ordinary working guy until he met God after his wife died. When Taylor catches up to him, she is immediately at odds with his female advisor and spots several areas of need for providing protection. Very quickly after meeting him, there is a car bomb used as a diversion and then a sudden ransom of sorts for Simons kidnapped 20 year old daughter. The ransom? Deny and denounce Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior. If Simon does this, his daughter will live and be released.
The conflict escalates at this point as the story begins to reflect the dilemma of Peter, Christs disciple, and his three-part denial of Jesus. What will Simon Mason do faced with the greatest challenge of his life? The commentary rages from, You cant deny Christ! to You must deny ChristHell know you dont mean it in your heart! 
Taylor vacillates between her professional inclinations and a growing attachment to Simon. Fighting through her faintly romantic feelings for the older man, she believes he will ultimately not deny Christ to save his daughter. Not being a Christian, she cannot imagine allowing a daughter to be sacrificed instead of simply making a statement not really meant. During the critical time before Simon telecasts his decision, she learns something about him which shocks her. 
The well-written story weaves in and out of severe conflicts and takes a few unexpected twists with a majorbut satisfyingsurprise at the end. Taylor is an honest character one cant help but like. Shes lost, hurting, and vulnerable but still manages to be a skilled professional. Simon Mason seems tested and full of his own kind of angst from the outset, and he isnt the most likable guy. Neither is he particularly unlikable. Hes a character who elicited both sympathy and contempt.
The similar name comparison of Simon Mason to the biblical Simon Peter along with the choices he must make as a result of his decisions gives way to a unique conclusion. I cant say definitively that I agree with what Simon Mason ultimately chose, but the author tackled a difficult subject with clarity and thoughtfulness and inspired real circumspection from this reader.
While I appreciated the unique approach to this difficult theme, and since the story clearly points to the differences in those who believe and those who dont, I wouldve preferred a clearer reference to salvation in the final revelation from Simon Mason.
In the end one must ask: Who is truly Forsaken in this story? 
Father, this is a story about a choice I hope I never have to make because I want so much to have the courage to do the right thing in your eyes. Jesus, give me the courage I need to make the gut-wrenching decisions you have for me to make. 
Lord, I ask you to bless James David Jordan with more thoughtful stories to bring you glory. Bless his life choices and keep him obedient to your desires. In the Name of Jesus, Amen. - http://hopeofglory.typepad.com/into_the_fire/2008/10/who-is-forsaken.html

When the terrorists strike, making a demand of the pastor that would shake the most steadfast saint, Taylor draws on all of her hard-knock toughness and training as she fights to save Simon and his daughter. Along the way, she discovers that she is not the only one who has done things she would like to forget-and she is not the only one who understands that some things are more important than living.

Editorial Review▼▲
Raised by her father, a Special Forces veteran, Taylor always knew she was different.  Practical rather than perfect, beautiful yet unaffected with a plethora of survival skills most adults never master, Taylors soul is still scarred when evil comes calling on her.  As a result, Taylor throws herself in to her studies and into a career protecting others, with a tenacity and ferocity rarely seen in a woman. Taylor serves her country well, despite controversy, in the Secret Service before opening her own Security company, Pasbury Security.
Under pressure from his devoted staff, following threats from Muslim extremists, Simon Mason, the worlds most revered televangelist reluctantly agrees to a security detail and handpicks Taylor Pasbury.  Fighting an attraction to this surprisingly understated man, Taylor implements security changes but is unable to prevent Simons daughter Kacey from kidnappers who demand Simon make an unthinkable choice if he wants to see Kacey again.
Simon, Taylor and Kacey find themselves caught up in life threatening events that may exact a price higher than death.
I have read many enthralling suspense novels, enjoyed meaningful love stories and delved into books that challenge my thinking and purpose but never has a novel combined all three elements, and with such adeptness, as Forsaken.  David James Jordans Taylor Pasbury is a complex woman with burdens from her past, unimaginable to most, yet is genuinely intriguing.  Simon Mason is a man who wields great power yet is grounded in his beliefs and compassion, but still has demons from his past to battle.  When the unbearable testing of his soul and spirit occurs, you will not be left untouched and as I did, will contemplate the choice you might make in Simons shoes.  Although the conclusion is satisfying, I was left feeling there was a depth to the characters that remained unexplored so I was thrilled to learn Taylors story does not end with this book.  A fascinating and emotional read, Forsaken will keep you up late, even when the last page is read, pondering your faith, the intricacies of love in all its forms and Gods unforseen purposes in this world.

                This review was written for Forsaken.
            
 
            The characters of this book were real people with human failings.  The author kept me in suspense right to the end of the book.  I will be watching for more books by this author.  I wouldn't mind another book with Taylor as the main character.

                This review was written for Forsaken.
            
 
            What an intriguing story through former Secret Service now Private Security Personnel Taylor Pasbury's eyes. The entire novel is told in a recitation with bits of humor as if in a verbal report. As a huge Alias/spy-type fan this story was a great fit in genre for me. It is shocking that I had not found author James David Jordan's work before, and now that I have I plan to read much more. I'm especially excited that as soon as I finish this review, I can start reading the sequel to this novel "Forsaken" which is called "Double Cross".Including some of the nit and gritty, this is a very realistic tale that brings to light the good and bad in people. Strength and forgiveness of ones-self are themes as well as terrorism plots and rescue attempts. This was one of those books where when I had to put it down to tend to something else I was amazed at how far I had already read. A page turner and a tool to delve into realism issues of the reader's own-self is only part of what makes this a great book. Highly recommended.
