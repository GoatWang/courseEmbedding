(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the Section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.  Special Note Regarding Smaller Reporting Company Status  We are filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a "smaller reporting company"  Overview  We are a clinical-stage regenerative medicine company developing novel therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases with large unmet medical needs. Our lead therapeutic candidate is the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System, or CardiAMP. We have initiated our U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted Phase III pivotal trial for CardiAMP in ischemic systolic heart failure, began treating patients in February 2017 and expect to obtain top-line data in 2019. If our Phase III pivotal trial is successful, we believe we will be the first company to reach the market with a cell-based therapy to treat heart failure. Our second therapeutic candidate is the CardiALLO Cell Therapy System, or CardiALLO. We anticipate preparation of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for submission to the FDA for a Phase II trial for CardiALLO for the treatment of ischemic systolic heart failure. This IND is expected to have improved Chemistry Manufacturing Controls, or CMC, in the IND relative to our previous co-sponsored investigations. We are committed to applying our expertise in the fields of autologous and allogeneic cell-based therapies to improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular conditions. Autologous cell therapies use autologous cells, which mean the patient's own cells, while allogeneic cell therapies use allogeneic cells, which means cells from a third party donor.  To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to our therapeutic candidates and biotherapeutic delivery systems, including conducting clinical trials, developing manufacturing and sales capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We have also generated modest revenues from sales of our approved products. We have funded our operations primarily through the sales of equity and convertible debt securities, and certain government and private grants. All convertible debt securities were converted into shares of our Common Stock in connection with the Merger.  We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. Our net losses were approximately $10.3 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $60.1 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, clinical trials, intellectual property matters, building our manufacturing and sales capabilities, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing losses for at least the next several years. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization of CardiAMP and CardiALLO. Until such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our therapeutic candidates. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research and development programs or the commercialization of any approved therapies or products or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Recent Events  On August 22, 2016, the Company, Icicle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, and BioCardia Lifesciences, Inc. (at the time, named BioCardia, Inc.) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement. On October 24, 2016, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Icicle Acquisition Corp. merged with and into BioCardia Lifesciences, with BioCardia Lifesciences continuing as the surviving company. BioCardia Lifesciences was determined to be the accounting acquirer, and following the completion of the Merger, we assumed the business and operations of BioCardia Lifesciences and changed our name to BioCardia, Inc.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the shares of BioCardia Lifesciences common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Merger, including shares of common stock underlying outstanding preferred stock, convertible notes (which converted into common stock immediately prior to the Merger), and stock options were converted into the right to receive 19.3678009 shares of our common stock.  For financial reporting purposes, the Merger is accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination because the Company did not meet the definition of a business as defined by US GAAP in advance of the Merger. The fair value of the purchase consideration, consisting of Tiger X common stock, was determined based on the fair value of the cash acquired by BioCardia Lifesciences in the Merger of $19 million, which is considered the best indicator for the fair value of the purchase consideration. No other assets or liabilities were acquired by BioCardia Lifesciences. Transaction costs of $96,000 were recorded as a debit to additional paid in capital.  The Merger is considered a tax free reverse triangular merger for tax purposes pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 368(a) and 368(a)(2)(E) in which the Company continues as the parent and BioCardia Lifesciences as the wholly owned subsidiary, and is therefore treated as an acquisition of stock of BioCardia Lifesciences by the Company. Despite the stock acquisition treatment, none of our pre-Merger tax attributes remain available after the Merger as a result of limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 due to lack of business continuity.  Financial Overview  Revenue  We currently have a portfolio of enabling and delivery products, from which we have generated modest revenue.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold includes the costs of raw materials and components, manufacturing personnel and facility costs and other indirect and overhead costs associated with manufacturing our enabling and delivery products.  Research and Development Expenses  Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:   salaries and related overhead expenses, which include share-based compensation and benefits for personnel in research and development functions;   fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, including in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analysis;   costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;   costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and   payments related to licensed products and technologies.  We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered and the services are performed.  We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop CardiAMP, and subject to the availability of additional funding, further advance the development of CardiALLO and any other therapeutic candidates for additional indications. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs, and accordingly we have not historically allocated resources specifically to our individual programs.  The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, finance and administration, sales, corporate development and administrative support functions, including share-based compensation expenses and benefits. Other significant selling, general and administrative expenses include sales commissions, rent, accounting and legal services, obtaining and maintaining patents, the cost of consultants, occupancy costs, insurance premiums and information systems costs.  We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a public company, conduct our Phase III pivotal trial for CardiAMP, and subject to the availability of additional funding, conduct our Phase II trial for CardiALLO and prepare for commercialization. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel to support product commercialization efforts and operations as a public company and increased fees for outside consultants, attorneys and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations and disclosures, and similar requirements applicable to public companies.  Other Income (Expense)  Other income and expense consists primarily of interest charges we incur in periods when we have convertible debt outstanding, interest income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and changes in the fair value of our warrant and convertible shareholder note derivative liabilities. Subsequent to the Merger we have no interest charges related to the convertible debt and changes in the fair value of our warrant and convertible shareholder note derivative liabilities as such instruments were converted, cancelled or exchanged as part of the Merger. We expect our interest income to increase following the completion of the Merger as we invest our cash on hand pending its use in our operations.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the periods presented. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We define our critical accounting policies as those that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. The following discussion addresses what we believe to be the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured.   Net Product Revenue. We recognize revenues from product sales when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, which typically occurs upon delivery. Product sale transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders, customer contracts, invoices, and/or the related shipping documents. Revenue is recognized net of provisions made for discounts, expected sales returns and allowances. Estimated returns and allowances are based on historical experience and other relevant factors. We accept returns for unused, unopened and resellable product in its original packaging, subject to a 20% restocking fee.   Collaboration Agreement Revenue. Collaboration agreement revenue is income from agreements under which we provide biotherapeutic delivery systems and customer training and support for their use in clinical trials and studies. We evaluate activities under these agreements to determine if they represent a multiple element arrangement by identifying the deliverables included within the agreement. We account for these deliverables as separate units of accounting if the following two criteria are met:  degree the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and  degree if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control.  Factors considered in this determination include, among other things, whether any other vendors sell the items separately and if the customer could use the delivered item for its intended purpose without receipt of the remaining deliverables. A change in these assumptions could impact our reported revenue, which could have a material impact to our financial statements.  If multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement consideration to those units of accounting based on their relative selling prices and recognize the associated revenue when the appropriate recognition criteria are met for those deliverables. The amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to the amounts that are fixed and determinable.  Research and Development-Clinical Trial Accruals  As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of expenses of our CROs and other third-party vendors.  Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. Through December 31, 2016, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot provide assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials.  Share-Based Compensation  BioCardia Lifesciences granted share-based compensation under its 2002 Stock Plan and 2016 Plan, which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger. The exercise price of options granted in 2016 was equivalent to the fair market value of BioCardia Lifesciences stock at the date of grant. The number of shares, terms, and vesting periods are determined by BioCardia's board of directors or a committee thereof on an option-by-option basis. Options generally vest ratably over service periods of four years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation cost for employee share-based awards is based on the grant-date fair value and will be recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award on a straight-line basis.  We measure and recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards to employees, directors and consultants based on fair value at the grant date. The unearned portion of nonemployee awards are remeasured at each reporting date. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, or BSM, to calculate fair value. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on options ultimately expected to vest, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures, and is recognized in the period the services are performed. Share-based compensation expense is revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates. When estimating forfeitures, we consider historic voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. For options granted to nonemployees, we revalue the unearned portion of the share-based compensation and the resulting change in fair value is recognized in the statements of operations over the period the related services are rendered.  The BSM option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility in the value of our Common Stock, and the expected term of the option. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.  Income Taxes  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  As of December 31, 2016, our total deferred tax assets, less our total deferred tax liabilities, were $21.6 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.  Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state provisions. These ownership change limitations may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions and we consummated the Merger in October 2016. These transactions, separately or combined with the purchasing stockholders' subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in such ownership changes, or could result in ownership changes in the future.  We have not performed an analysis to assess whether an ownership change has occurred. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our formation, utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code, which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term, tax-exempt rate, and then applying any additional adjustments that are required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any limitation known, no amounts are being considered as an uncertain tax position or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate. Any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets, with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance.  Results of Operations  The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Revenue: Net product revenue $ 517 $ 860 Collaboration agreement revenue 59 44 Total revenue 576 904 Cost and expenses: Cost of goods sold 746 1,061 Research and development 3,330 1,518 Selling, general and administrative 4,108 3,734 Total cost and expenses 8,184 6,313 Operating loss (7,608 ) (5,409 ) Write-off of deferred financing costs - (1,634 ) Interest expense (1,736 ) (1,386 ) Other income (expense) (966 ) 1,732 Net loss $ (10,310 ) $ (6,697 )  Revenue. Revenue decreased by approximately $328,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a reduction in sales volumes for Morph products subsequent to the reduction in the sales and production workforce in August 2015. We expect sales in 2017 to be generally consistent with 2016.  Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased by approximately $315,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 consistent with the reduction in revenue.  Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to expenses incurred in the planning and preparation for the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we increase enrollment of the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $312,000 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to indirect costs associated with the Merger and expenses incurred to transition to public company operations, including legal costs, audit, accounting, tax, valuation service and financial printing. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase due to expenses to be incurred as we build our infrastructure to support the CardiAMP Phase III pivotal trial and enhance public company operations.  Write Off of Deferred Financing Costs. The Company deferred costs incurred for a planned initial public offering by BioCardia Lifesciences, or the IPO, which included legal, accounting and other professional fees. The IPO was delayed and subsequently withdrawn, and as a result, the Company recorded a write-off of deferred offering costs of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of interest expense related to convertible notes. The increase is attributable to longer period of principle outstanding in 2016.  Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted primarily of the changes in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liabilities and the change in value of the convertible shareholder note derivative liability.

Consensus Ratings for BioCardia (NASDAQ:BCDA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
