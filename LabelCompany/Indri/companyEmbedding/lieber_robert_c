Q. How much do you expect to lend in 2013?A. We’ll do close to $500 million this year of origination. Last year we did about half of that.It’s kind of the smaller market — the owners of income-producing property — not the $100 million loans with names that you recognize. The average loan size is about $10 million.Q. What percentage of your business is in the New York area?A. Little. Most of our business, in fact, is not in the New York area.Q.  You’re very much focused on New York as chairman of the local Urban Land Institute. Have you set any goals since taking the helm this summer?

A. One of the things that I wanted to do was get more participation from our global or national members of U.L.I. who are here in New York, and get them more involved in the district council activities here.I want to continue to focus and channel our efforts to a clear set of initiatives that address local land-use policies. The other part of U.L.I., which is so critical, is what I would call the networking side. One of the particular goals that I have for the U.L.I. in the next three years is to increase the interaction and relevance of the experienced to the young leaders’ group.Q. One of the main roles of the Urban Land Institute is to address land use. There seems to be a growing shortage of buildable land, and what’s available has skyrocketed in price.

A. You phrase that like you think it’s a negative. I don’t view it as a negative at all. I think it is a testimony to New York’s standing and stature internationally as being a desirable place for people to live, to visit and raise their families. We could go back to 1978 to see the other side of the coin.

Having said that, it does highlight one of the critical areas that needs to be addressed, and I think that’s going to be part of the incoming mayor’s focus and it certainly was a part of Mayor Bloomberg’s focus. And that’s how do we create more affordable housing.Q. What other areas need attention?A. The competitiveness of New York relies on a couple of things. Our power grid here is very, very fragile, and there hasn’t been a lot of investment made in that infrastructure in some time. And this is not an issue tied uniquely and solely to New York City. This is a regional issue.Another one is transportation. We’ve added a million and a half people in the last 20 years and forecasts are for another million and a half to two million. Where are we going to put all these people? How are they going to be able to get around? So having the necessary improvements to mass transit is critical.Also, what are we doing with our waterfront? We have over 600 miles of waterfront in and around New York City in different states of repair or disrepair.Q. Have you reached out to Bill de Blasio and his administration yet?A. We have indirectly. One of the co-chairs of the transition team committee is a U.L.I. member who I’ve known for some time.Q. What are your thoughts about the mayor-elect?A. I think that time will tell. I know him a little bit. He’s very smart, very persuasive. I think he’s got a clear view of what he wants to try to accomplish.Q.  Are you still in contact with your old boss, Michael Bloomberg?A. Yeah. When I came to work for the mayor, my expectation was that it would be a two-year experience. That was before there was a third term. I stayed a little over three and a half years.

Robert C. Lieber, the former Wall Street executive who has guided the Bloomberg administration’s economic development efforts during the recession, told his staff on Wednesday that he would step down as deputy mayor in June.Mr. Lieber, 55, who has been in the job since January 2008, has focused on projects including the redevelopment of Coney Island, the city’s takeover of Governors Island and the rezoning of Willets Point in Queens. He also has pushed the city’s economic development strategy beyond big real estate deals to include smaller entrepreneurial initiatives and a number of growing industries.“He recognized that economic development is much more than real estate development,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City. “He understood the importance of establishing working relationships with industry leaders and aligning city policies and programs with their needs.”One significant result of meetings with media and technology companies was the creation of an incubator for small information technology companies in the Hudson Square area of Manhattan.

Mr. Lieber said he had not intended to leave City Hall, but an old friend and former client, Andrew L. Farkas, had offered him a spot at the Island Capital Group, a merchant real estate bank that recently acquired a company that, he said, would be at the center of sorting out troubled real estate loans.

“I told the mayor this is the toughest decision I ever had to make,” Mr. Lieber said. “I love the job. I’m most proud of having taken a lot of these projects that had been put in the oven but not baked and gotten them done, whether it’s Coney Island, Willets Point or the World Trade Center.”To his regret, Mr. Lieber was unable to overcome opposition in the City Council to turning the city-owned Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall. Some Council members, unions and community groups had sought to require prospective employers there to pay workers at least $10 an hour, a sum that both the developer and Mr. Lieber said would have put the mall at a competitive disadvantage.Mr. Lieber was well known in business circles when he took the job, but he did not have the same high profile as his predecessor, Daniel L. Doctoroff, who was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s first deputy mayor for economic development. Armed with a broad vision of the city’s future, Mr. Doctoroff was often the public face of the administration as he spearheaded the city’s ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, worked on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center and rezoned the Far West Side of Manhattan and the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn for high-rises.In January 2007, Mr. Doctoroff recruited Mr. Lieber, then the managing director for the private equity division of Lehman Brothers, to become the president of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. When Mr. Doctoroff resigned a year later, Mr. Lieber moved to City Hall.Mr. Lieber is the third deputy mayor to announce his departure at a time when city government is cutting budgets and is less able to embark on grand plans. In March, Edward Skyler announced that he was leaving for Citigroup, and Kevin Sheekey said he was headed to Bloomberg L.P.

Mr. Bloomberg has not been shy about going outside of government ranks for their replacements. He appointed Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis and a management expert, to Mr. Skyler’s job as deputy mayor for operations, despite his unfamiliarity with New York.But replacing Mr. Lieber may be another matter. The city lost roughly 150,000 jobs during the recession, and the unemployment rate is 10 percent. Modest job growth has been reported recently, but much of it has been at the lower end of the pay scale.“They need a replacement who is able to hit the ground running in order to implement much-needed economic development initiatives,” said Ross F. Moskowitz, a former city economic development official who is now a partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. “Resources are scarce, and there’s an immediate need for action.”

City officials say they are looking at candidates inside and outside the administration. Prospects include the current president of the Economic Development Corporation, Seth W. Pinsky, and two former leaders of the agency, Josh Sirefman and Carl B. Weisbrod.Mr. Lieber was criticized at times by real estate executives for what they called a lack of vision and for failing to push hard enough for their proposals or to overcome objections from rival departments at City Hall.Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for small businesses who opposed the city’s plan to redevelop Willets Point and to use eminent domain to gain control of the land, said that Mr. Lieber’s approach failed to account for the collateral damage to the neighborhood.“The deputy mayor and his agency have proceeded in a recession to promote a project that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and displace scores of small businesses and thousands of workers without any conceivable plan or a developer to implement it,” Mr. Lipsky said.In April, John C. Liu, the city comptroller, released an audit showing that the Economic Development Corporation, which Mr. Lieber oversees, had kept more than $125 million in payments, taxes and fees rather than turning them over to the city’s general fund.Mr. Bloomberg praised Mr. Lieber on Wednesday. “Bob came to our administration with a reputation for getting things done, and he certainly has,” he said in a statement. “Bob helped set the path for growth that will benefit New Yorkers for generations.”

N.Y. Deputy Mayor Lieber Resigns






                    May 19, 2010 10:05 am  ET
                  


By Michael Howard Saul
Robert C. Lieber, deputy mayor for economic  development, has  tendered his  resignation, marking the latest  high-profile departure in  the upper echelons of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s  administration.
Lieber  will leave City Hall in  June and return to the private sector,  Bloomberg announced Wednesday  morning. He will become a senior  executive at an affiliated company of Island  Capital, a real estate  merchant banking and asset management  firm.
In recent months,  Bloomberg has announced the departure of two  other deputy mayors, Kevin  Sheekey  and Edward Skyler. Both men played key roles in Mr.  Bloomberg’s first  mayoral campaign and were part of the  mayor’s inner  circle.
In 2007, Bloomberg announced that Lieber would  replace  Dan Doctoroff, who left  city government to become president of  Bloomberg LP, the company founded by  Bloomberg.
“Bob helped us   through a time of unprecedented national economic turmoil,” Bloomberg  said in a statement. “He’s made  a huge impact, and I wish him the  best.”
