For Patent AttorneysPatent-Pilot helps patent attorneys and patent law firms to analyze clients and competitors. Which foreign law firms are potential partner for cooperation on your filings? Which other law firms are serving your clients? Who is the law firm representing the opposing party in your case?For Patent Attorneys




For CompaniesPatent-Pilot helps companies to benchmark the patent attorneys and patent law firms representing their company and identify new partners. Are you working with law firms you are experts in your field of expertise? Are you aware of potential conflicts of interest with other clients of your representative?For Companies




How Patent-Pilot WorksPatent-Pilot analyzes more than 2.3 million patent applications. Based on those documents, we create profiles of patent attorneys and patent law firms and developed an algorithm which allocates patent attorneys to their most recent law firm and generates the statistics and visualizations.How It Works

Identify Patent Attorneys and Patent Law Firms
You can search through more than 2.3 million patent documents for intellectual property firms from more than 67 countries.
Searching for names includes patent attorneys, patent law firms and patent applicants.
Or you can search using a technical keyword. In this case, you will receive a result list containing all patent attorneys who have represented applications regarding those keywords.
Patent-Pilot is based on all PCT patent applications which were filed before the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In our database you can find all patent attorneys and patent law firms who represented at least 5 PCT applications.




 




Analyze Patent Attorneys in Law Firms
Patent-Pilot allocates all patent attorneys to their most recent law firm.
Not only patent law firms can be analyzed. You can also see inside of law firms and on the level of patent attorneys who is responsible for certain technical fields and most experienced.
This is crucial if you want to know who the real experts are. Moreover, we make sure that the experience displayed is connetcted to the patent attorneys who actually work for a law firm. If an attorney leaves, she takes expertise and experience with her.

 

Check technical experience
The technical experience of your attorneys or your cooperating patent law firms is often very important in patent filing and prosecution for achieving comprehensive property rights that also stand in opposition or infringement cases.
Patent-Pilot delivers charts that illustrate the technical areas in an understandable categorization. This is much more practicable than the traditional IPC classification. It’s based on those classes but arrange them in a different way.
You can limit the charts to certain areas or display only applications tht were represented for a certain client.
Thereby, you can gain a fast and objective overview of technical experience of these patent law firms









Analyze client relationships of patent law firms
Patent-Pilot can show you which clients patent attorneys are working
This makes the relationship between clients and law firms transparent. Who are the most important clients of a law firm? Are the winning or loosing mandates? Which companies that are not on the client list might be interesting prospects and who are the representatives of those companies?
Very important is also the question of conflicts of interests and mandate collisions.

Five times married billionaire Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman will add to his already impressive brood after it was announced that he is to be a dad for the eight time.The 68-year-old and his current wife Dr Anna Chapman are expecting their second child via surrogacy in the early summer.And friends have told the New York Post that Mr Perelman and Miss Chapman are looking forward to a baby brother to one year old Oscar who was born in December 2010.  



Parents Again: Revlon CEO Ron Perelman leaves Nello's Restaurant with Anna Chapman (left) on September 29, 2006 in New York CityRanked
 by Forbes magazine as the 26th richest man in America with an estimated
 wealth of $12 billion, Mr Perelman's marriage and business history reads 
like a Hollywood melodrama.Married for the first time in 1965 aged 22 to property-heir Faith Golding, Mr Perelman divorced her in 1984 and went on to marry gossip columnist Claudia Cohen in 1985, activist Patricia Duff in 1994, actress Ellen Barkin in 2000 and Dr Chapman in 2010.Since his first marriage Mr Perelman has to date fathered three daughters, Debra, Samantha and Caleigh, one son with another on the way and adopted three children with first wife, Steven, Josh and Hope.  



Many wives and children: Billionaire Ron Perelman with his then wife, gossip columnist Claudia Cohen and daughter Caleigh in his arms
Known as much for his colourful personal life as for his business acumen, he is reputed to have paid out $153 million over his four divorce settlements over the past 47 years.THE MANY WIVES OF A COSMETICS GIANT FAITH GOLDING: 1965-1984Married Ronald Perelman in 1965 when she was aged 17 and he was 22. Gave birth to Debra and adopted Steven, Josh and Hope with Perelman.CLAUDIA COHEN: 1985-1994Married Ronald Perelman in 1985 and together they had one daughter, Samantha.In August 1993, Perelman filed for divorce and it is claimed that Cohen received a settlement of over $80 million.PATRICIA DUFF: 1995-1996Married Perelman in January 1995 and gave birth to Perelman's fourth daughter Caleigh Sophia.The marriage collapsed within eighteen months and the pair were divorced by the end of 1996.ELLEN BARKIN: 2000-2006The Hollywood actress star of Sea of Love married Perelman in June 2000. They had no children.ANNA CHAPMAN: 2010-Dr Anna Chapman: The Harvard Educated psychiatrist married Perelman in September 2010 and they have a child, Oscar, through a surrogate born in November of 2010. They are expecting another boy through a surrogate at the beginning of summer.
Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Greensboro, North Carolina, Mr Perelman made his name as an entreprenuer through his MacAndrews and Forbes holding company and is best known as the chairman of Revlon, the cosmetics giant.With multimillion dollar homes on the
 Upper East Side of Manhattan and the Hampton's on Long Island, Mr Perelman
 has become a fixture in the gossip pages following his high profile 
take over of Revlon and for his multiple marriages.
Unusually for a billionaire, Mr Perelman
 is unafraid of airing his dirty washing in public and each of his four 
divorces have been messy affairs.
At one stage four years ago Mr Perelman 
was in court fighting three of his ex-wives over money with only his 
first wife Faith Golding having kept a low profile since their divorce 
28 years ago.Prominent amongst the exclusive 'Old 
Society' set in New York and Long Island, Mr Perelman who is a devout 
follower of Judaism has been described in the past as a 'control 
freak' by critics and a 'family man' by friends.
Growing up in Philadelphia, Mr Perelman 
attended the University of Pennslyvania and subsequently the Wharton 
School of business before beginning his career working for his father 
Raymond at the family sheet-metal company.
Having acquired MacAndrews and Forbes
 with a loan from first wife Golding, Mr Perelman came to public prominence 
with his hostile acquisition of Revlon in 1985.
Since then, Mr Perelman has added more 
than 50 companies to his portfolio including Marvel Entertainment, makers
 of the Thor, Captain America and Iron Man film franchises.Described as a hot head in his 
business-dealings, Mr Perelman is known as someone always looking for the 
next corporate opportunity.
'He's not known as a kind-hearted guy,' said Mark Stein of Portfolio.com in a New York Post profile on Perelman.
'He's run through a lot of executives.'

  Well known for his playboy lifestyle Mr Perelman is reputed to own two private jets and a Sikorsky helicopter that he uses to fly to his beach home in East Hampton.Almost moving seamlessly from one marriage to the next, Mr Perelman's private life has been played out in the courts.During his bitter custody battle with Patricia Duff over daughter Caleigh, a court psychiatrist testified that Mr Perelman needed 'long-term therapy' to control his 'volcanic temper.'

Other legal battles have included a dispute with Ellen Barkin over a $3 million funding promise for her production company which Mr Perelman agreed to as part of their 2006 divorce.However, for Mr Perelman control freakery is a charge that he denies.'Would I like to control things so I get what I want all the time? Absolutely. Is it possible? Absolutely not,' said Mr Perelman in a rare 2006 interview with Details magazine.'I surround myself with very smart, very strong people--including my ex-wives.'The likelihood of controlling these people is not a real possibility.'
