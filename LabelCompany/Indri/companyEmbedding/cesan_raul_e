Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    1:08 PM ET 07/19/2017
                                                


Conference Call Scheduled for August 8, 2017 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time Gartner, Inc. (IT), the worlds leading research and advisory company, today announced that it plans to report its financial results for the second quarter 2017 before the market opens on Tuesday, August 8, 2017.













						                            
			                                Gartner stock price target raised to $142 from $130 at RBC Capital
			                            


			                                MarketWatch – 
			                                7:43 AM ET 07/19/2017
			                            
















                                                    Global IT spending growth outlook increases, as dollar falls
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    9:58 AM ET 07/13/2017
                                                


Global spending on information technology in 2017 is now expected to rise 2.4% above last year to $3.48 trillion, up from a previous forecast of 1.4% growth, according to research and advisory firm Gartner Inc.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

Factory Problems Unresolved, Schering-Plough President Is Out

By MELODY PETERSENJUNE 28, 2001

Schering-Plough, which has had repeated quality-control problems at its factories, said yesterday that its president and chief operating officer was resigning.Raul E. Cesan, 53, will step down on July 15. Mr. Cesan has been responsible for the company's manufacturing operations since 1994, when he became president of Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals.The company surprised analysts in February when it said that the Food and Drug Administration was withholding final approval of its new allergy drug, Clarinex, until problems at its factories were corrected.Last week, Schering-Plough said F.D.A. inspectors had recently found additional problems at its factories in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The company said the government inspectors also found that some problems uncovered in previous inspections had not yet been corrected.

According to government inspection reports, the problems have been related to drugs including Claritin; Nasonex, a nasal spray; Proventil, an inhaler for asthma patients; and Celestone, a corticosteroid. Continue reading the main story

In a written statement, Richard Jay Kogan, Schering-Plough's chairman and chief executive, said Mr. Cesan was resigning, as well, from the company's board. Mr. Cesan is also a member of the board of The New York Times Company.''We are all grateful to Raul for his many contributions,'' Mr. Kogan said. ''His many accomplishments are not overshadowed by the company's current challenges.''The news did not hearten analysts, who have received little information from Schering-Plough since February. The company is planning to present more information to analysts at a meeting today.

Barbara A. Ryan of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown said Mr. Cesan's resignation might help show the F.D.A. that Schering-Plough is taking the manufacturing problems seriously. Some of these date to 1998.''All of these manufacturing problems happened on his watch,'' Ms. Ryan said. ''He was the fall guy.''Another analyst, Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners in New York, said the news diminished his hope that Schering-Plough and F.D.A. officials were negotiating an agreement that would help resolve the manufacturing problems. ''If you had a consent decree in hand,'' he said, ''you would not need a sacrificial lamb.''In trading yesterday, Schering-Plough stock fell $1.67, to $36.98.In March, the consumer group Public Citizen asked the government to investigate whether the company had shipped asthma inhalers to patients knowing that they were defective. Schering-Plough recalled certain inhalers last year after finding that some did not contain albuterol, an ingredient that helps patients breathe.The company denied the consumer group's assertions.Public Citizen asked for the inquiry after receiving a copy of an internal consultant's report on the factory problems and a recent F.D.A. inspection report. The two reports were sent by a person who also included a letter mentioning Mr. Cesan. In the letter, the person refused to be identified out of fear of dismissal.''Under the present C.O.O., Raul Cesan,'' it said, ''this company has changed from a quality drug manufacturer to one that is now profit-driven.'' The letter added: ''Within the past two years, many quality directors and upper management were driven out and replaced with unqualified people. The result, as the F.D.A. report indicates, is a product that is not within the level of quality, purity or safety that the company purports it to be.''

A spokesman for Schering-Plough refused to comment on the letter.The company has said it is confident that all prescription and over-the-counter products now in the marketplace are safe and effective. Last week, it detailed steps it is taking to improve manufacturing operations. Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 - The Food and Drug Administration holds thousands of meetings a year with drug and device makers, but few have as much at stake for a company as the one planned for Friday with Boston Scientific.Consider a meeting under similar circumstances that the agency had in 2001 with the top management of Schering-Plough. The F.D.A. had lost patience with Schering-Plough, after repeatedly warning it about problems with its manufacture of asthma inhalers. Again and again, the company promised changes. Again and again, it faltered.Finally, the agency threatened to withhold approval of Clarinex, Schering-Plough's crucial follow-on to its blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, until it solved the problems in its factory operations.Trying to salvage things, Raul E. Cesan, who was then the company's president and chief operating officer, boarded a corporate jet with his executive team and flew to Puerto Rico for a meeting with F.D.A. inspectors and officials.

The conference was tense from the start, according to executives who attended it. They spoke on condition of anonymity because, while no longer at the company, they still have dealings with it. Mr. Cesan, who left Schering-Plough in June 2001, declined this week to discuss the meeting. Continue reading the main story

As the executives recall that day in Puerto Rico, Mr. Cesan, a take-charge man known for a somewhat autocratic style, with his color rising told subordinates to leave the room, saying that he wanted to talk to the regulators alone."Raul is an extremely aggressive guy," one of the executives recalled, "but that kind of behavior doesn't go over well with regulators. I don't know what he said, but the next week we had inspectors crawling all over every one of our plants."

Those inspections found even more problems in the Schering-Plough factories. Approval for Clarinex was delayed by more than a year, and the company eventually paid a $500 million fine. Schering-Plough, these days under new leadership, is still suffering the effects.The meeting was the culmination of years of aggressive confrontation with regulators that was encouraged by top company officials, including the former chairman, Richard J. Kogan, former executives said. Mr. Kogan has refused to comment on these matters in the past and he did not return a phone message this week. A Schering-Plough spokesman, Ken Banta, declined to comment.Mr. Cesan left the drug maker in 2001 and has since founded an investment partnership. He is also a director of The New York Times Company.While Boston Scientific does not have a reputation for regulatory showdowns, if F.D.A. officials detect any defiance, the company could be in trouble, said Daniel E. Troy, a Washington lawyer who is a former F.D.A. general counsel."When you are in this realm of overall management failures and overall management control issues," Mr. Troy said. "then what F.D.A. really wants to see is a culture change." Just as important, he said, will be the company's efforts to repair the quality-control problems that were detailed in the agency's warning letter."A lot is riding not just on the meeting," Mr. Troy said, "but on how they respond to the letter."
