David Braswell has extensive corporate and securities law experience advising a wide range of clients from emerging businesses to Fortune 500 companies. His practice includes serving as lead counsel to corporations and their boards of directors, providing guidance on compliance issues, and helping them shape and execute their strategic plans and operational goals.
He is also a recognized leader within Armstrong Teasdale and serves on its Executive Committee. In this capacity, Braswell is involved in key decisions affecting the firm’s management and growth.
Transactional Experience Braswell advises both public and private companies on mergers, asset and stock acquisitions, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations, securities registrations, private placements and various types of financings. In addition, he counsels clients on venture capital, private equity, and formation and other organizational matters affecting entrepreneurs, investors and emerging companies.
SEC Compliance and Investigations Serving as lead counsel to many public companies, Braswell ensures compliance with the SEC’s periodic reporting requirements, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy statements, Section 16 reports and other public filings, as well as the continuously evolving changes to SEC disclosure and reporting requirements.

Corporate Governance Braswell assists boards of directors and board committees on strategic matters, governance issues, activist shareholders, fiduciary duties and other matters. He also provides counsel on proxy contests, poison pills, hostile takeovers, forced and agreed buyouts and split-ups, internal investigations and issues arising out of majority-minority shareholder relationships.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

JOB CREATION AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
With an unemployment rate remaining stubbornly over 9%, Arizona must do more to create high paying jobs in those industries that will lead the state out of the greatest recession since World War II.  Since we are in competition with other states � and even other countries � for the companies that will offer those jobs to Arizonans, it is our responsibility to develop... Read More

BORDER SECURITY AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
As a people from many cultures around the world, immigration has played a vital and important role in weaving and renewing our social fabric both in Arizona and in the United States.  Individuals who bypass the lawfully established process for becoming citizens show disrespect for those who do so legally, create unnecessary burdens on limited state government resources and pose a security risk to the public... Read More

K - 12 AND HIGHER EDUCATION
As your District 6 Senator and a former  school teacher, administrator and elected Governing Board member, I support objective accountability from public school systems, data-driven pay for exceptional teachers, the free operation of charter schools within district attendance boundaries, constitutionally approved vouchers for parents of all students to encourage school choice and tuition tax credits for public, charter, home schooled and private schools. Read More

BALANCED BUDGET AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING
I support balancing the budget every year by limiting spending authority to a five-year average of revenue and auditing each department within the state government to identify and correct wasteful spending, service redundancy and agency inefficiency on an annual basis.  I support measures to ensure that spending in any budget year is equal to or less than revenue. I want to prohibit  “smoke and mirrors” tactics, “gimmick accounting” and constitutionally prohibited debt. Read More
