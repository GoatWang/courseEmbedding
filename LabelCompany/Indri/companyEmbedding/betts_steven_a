PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chanen Construction Company announced today that Steve Betts, former 
      president and CEO of SunCor Development Company, is joining the senior 
      leadership team as president. He will be responsible for leading new 
      business development in Arizona and across the U.S. Founder Herman 
      Chanen continues in his role as chairman of the 58-year-old construction 
      company, and Steven R. Chanen remains as chief executive officer.
    


      “At Chanen Construction Company, we look forward to the next six decades 
      of success and innovation,” said CEO Steven R. Chanen. “We’re confident 
      in Steve’s leadership and the instrumental role he’ll play in scripting 
      our future. He is a trusted, results-oriented industry professional, who 
      benefits from a likeability factor that is off the charts.”
    

      Known as a leader in real estate development of large-scale office, 
      industrial and mixed-used projects and master planned communities, Betts 
      is also regarded for his work on complex development agreements and 
      economic development projects uniting private, government and 
      institutional interests. Over his 30-year career, Betts has led the 
      development of legislation resulting in the Tourism and Sports Authority 
      Act, the Community Facilities District Act, Development Agreement Act 
      and the Military Airport Authority. In addition, he served as legal 
      counsel and facilitated the creation of important regional landmarks 
      such as the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale and Chase Field in 
      downtown Phoenix. As SunCor president and CEO, he led the development of 
      the award-winning Hayden Ferry Lakeside on Tempe Town Lake, a 43-acre 
      urban mixed-use property.
    

      More recently, he served as CEO of PhoenixMart, a 
      1.7-million-square-foot multi-category, manufacturer product-sourcing 
      center, and as senior vice president and managing director of assets for 
      the Arizona State University Foundation.
    

      “Joining Chanen marries my two passions of real estate and economic 
      development,” said Betts. “Building high-quality, job-generating 
      projects is critical to Arizona and regions across the U.S. where Chanen 
      has a presence. The reputation, credibility and competence of Chanen’s 
      team is unrivaled, and I look forward to supplementing their legacy.”
    

      A long-time community steward, Betts is the recipient of numerous awards 
      including Developer of the Year by the Arizona Chapter of the National 
      Association of Industrial and Office Park Developers, Most Admired CEO 
      by the Phoenix Business Journal and Developer of the Year by Southwest 
      Contractor Magazine. He currently serves as chairman of the Urban 
      Land Institute Arizona District Council Governance Committee, a member 
      of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council’s Executive Committee, a member 
      of the Maricopa Association of Government’s Economic Development 
      Committee and chair of the I-11 Coalition.
    

      “When I started this company in 1955, I had two goals: to build 
      important buildings and run a company with smart, ethical and 
      exceptional people,” said board chair, Herman Chanen. “Steve Betts is 
      the epitome of those ideals. His expertise as a real estate developer 
      and strategic insight on economic development concerns will be 
      invaluable to our team.”

History[edit]




W.B. Mason Head Quarters
Brockton, Massachusetts
(September 2011)



W.B. Mason was founded in 1898 by William Betts Mason in Brockton, Massachusetts. Its world headquarters still remain in Brockton to this day. The company started as a business that sold printed products, engraved products, and rubber stamps.
As the city of Brockton expanded in the early 20th century, largely due to the shoe industry, W.B. Mason, too, expanded its sales offerings to include office supplies.
W.B. Mason has continued as a family owned and operated business since its founding. William Betts Mason ran the company until his death in 1912. The Mason family continued to oversee the company until the 1920s under William's wife, Marcena. In the late 1920s W.B. Mason was sold to an employee and Brockton businessman, Samuel Kovner, who started his career out by sweeping the floors at W.B. Mason as a boy.
Under Kovner, the company reached sales of $243,000. In 1963 Kovner sold the company to his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Joseph Greene. The Greenes added furniture sales to the company's selection and the W.B. Mason Company reached nearly a million dollars in sales upon Mr. Greene's passing in 1973. After his death, their son Steve Greene took over leadership of the company. In 1983 Steve Greene and his brother, John Greene, officially took over ownership from their mother. They invited the two top sales representatives, Leo Meehan and Thomas Golden to join the ownership group. By 1993, under Steve Greene's leadership, the company grew to $20 million in sales. In 1993 Steve Greene replaced his mother Helen Greene as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Upon Greene's appointment to the board, Leo Meehan became the President and CEO of the company. Under Meehan's guidance, the company adopted a new corporate strategy focused on localized service, personalized solutions, and free delivery. Under this new model, W.B. Mason reached sales of $247 million by 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, the company reached $1 billion in sales. In November 2013, W.B. Mason partnered with Lyreco to provide worldwide delivery options to multi-national customers. [9]

William Betts Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1865. After his father's death in 1871, he immigrated to the United States with his grandmother Agnes Dunn Bettridge, mother Janet C. Mason (née Bettridge) and sisters Sarah, Eliza, and Eadith Mason. In 1872 his family moved to Brockton, at the time known as North Bridgewater[10], to live with Janet's brother Arthur J. C. Bettridge. Mason's first occupation was as a counter maker and trimmer in Brockton [11].
He married his first wife Clara W. Belcher of Randolph, Massachusetts in 1892.[12] He continued to work in the counter making field until 1893, at which point he went to work for S.W.S. Howard, a local printing company.[13] In 1896 he left S.W.S. Howard and went into business for himself, making specialty brass plates, checks, and rubber stamps.
In 1898 Mason founded the W.B. Mason Company as a rubber stamp and stencil company. Still to this day, W.B. Mason manufactures its own rubber stamps. In December of 1905, Mason married his second wife, Marcena D. Horton of Bristol, Rhode Island[14] . She would go on to run the company from the time of Mason's death in 1912 until Samuel Kovner's acquisition of the company in the late 1920s.
Mason Passed away in 1912 due to heart failure. During his life, William Betts Mason sang around Brockton in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet, and was a member of the Brockton based Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. His final resting place is a half mile from W.B. Mason world headquarters at Union Cemetery on Centre Street in Brockton. Mason had no children in either marriage, but his legacy continues to live on through his company that's history spans three centuries.

W.B. Mason Logo






A W.B. Mason Blizzard copy paper box is featured on the poster for the 2014 Academy Award recipient Spotlight.


In 1986 the company introduced its iconic slogan, "Who But W.B. Mason". Later, the slogan was combined with a portrait from the 1890s of founder William Betts Mason to synthesize their current corporate logo. The logo features two U.S. flags flanking the portrait of W.B. Mason. The flag on the right has 50 stars to represent the current state of the union, but the one on the left shows only 45 stars, the configuration at the time of the company's founding in 1898. In 1997 W.B. Mason began advertising on television. Its inaugural commercial was played during the 1997 Super Bowl. Besides their commercials, their fully decorated trucks and baseball park signage serve as W.B. Mason's primary forms of advertising. Both their trucks and baseball park sinage have become an iconic part of their brand and have been spotted in many movies and on local network television.

Other Forms of Sponsorship[edit]
W.B. Mason also has sponsorships with Madison Square Garden in New York City, Foxwoods Resort & Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut as well as with the Boston Bruins and New England Patriots.
Philanthropy[edit]
The W.B. Mason Company strives to follow in its founder footprints by playing an active role in the Brockton community. William Betts Mason believed that being involved in his community would help to contribute to the strength and vitality of Brockton. During his life he was involved in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet and the Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. Both of these groups allowed him to be a more productive member of Brockton. The Company to this day still tries to live up to Mason's commitment by giving back to many of Brockton institutions.
Projects[edit]
In June of 2017 W.B. Mason announced a $10 million donation toward the Leo J. Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. Meehan, president and CEO of W.B. Mason, is an alumnus of the college. This was the second largest donation in the school's history. The business school will open in August 2019. It will house Stonehill’s accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, economics and healthcare administration programs.[16] Stonehill College is located less than five miles from W.B. Mason world headquarters in Brockton.
In 2007 W.B. Mason donated $1 million toward the Helen Greene Cardiac Catheterization Suite at local Brockton Hospital. The cardiac suite is equipped with the most advanced technology to perform Intravascular Ultrasounds, AngioJets, Radial Stenting, Advanced X-Rays, and more. The suite was named after Helen Greene, who was a former owner, and is the mother of current Chairman Steve Greene and President of the Office Products Division John Greene.[17]
W.B. Mason was a platinum benefactor in the opening of the Trinity Catholic Academy in Brockton, Massachusetts.[18] Trinity Catholic Academy is the amalgamation of the schools of three Catholic parishes in Brockton. St. Edward, St. Casimir, and Sacred Heart Parishes operated independent Catholic schools in the greater Brockton area that were faced with declining enrollment, deteriorating facilities, and financial troubles.[19] Trinity Catholic Academy was opened to preserve the option of Catholic education for the greater Brockton community.
W.B. Mason was the primary donor to W.B. Mason Stadium, Stonehill College's football, lacrosse, field hockey, and track & field stadium. W.B. Mason Stadium opened for the 2005 season.[20] The special relationship with Stonehill is largely due to the significant number of Stonehill alumni employed by W.B. Mason.
Locations[edit]
W.B. Mason has over 60 distribution centers in the United States, and provides nationwide delivery services to its customers. Through its partnership with Lyreco it has worldwide distribution capabilities.

History[edit]




W.B. Mason Head Quarters
Brockton, Massachusetts
(September 2011)



W.B. Mason was founded in 1898 by William Betts Mason in Brockton, Massachusetts. Its world headquarters still remain in Brockton to this day. The company started as a business that sold printed products, engraved products, and rubber stamps.
As the city of Brockton expanded in the early 20th century, largely due to the shoe industry, W.B. Mason, too, expanded its sales offerings to include office supplies.
W.B. Mason has continued as a family owned and operated business since its founding. William Betts Mason ran the company until his death in 1912. The Mason family continued to oversee the company until the 1920s under William's wife, Marcena. In the late 1920s W.B. Mason was sold to an employee and Brockton businessman, Samuel Kovner, who started his career out by sweeping the floors at W.B. Mason as a boy.
Under Kovner, the company reached sales of $243,000. In 1963 Kovner sold the company to his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Joseph Greene. The Greenes added furniture sales to the company's selection and the W.B. Mason Company reached nearly a million dollars in sales upon Mr. Greene's passing in 1973. After his death, their son Steve Greene took over leadership of the company. In 1983 Steve Greene and his brother, John Greene, officially took over ownership from their mother. They invited the two top sales representatives, Leo Meehan and Thomas Golden to join the ownership group. By 1993, under Steve Greene's leadership, the company grew to $20 million in sales. In 1993 Steve Greene replaced his mother Helen Greene as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Upon Greene's appointment to the board, Leo Meehan became the President and CEO of the company. Under Meehan's guidance, the company adopted a new corporate strategy focused on localized service, personalized solutions, and free delivery. Under this new model, W.B. Mason reached sales of $247 million by 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, the company reached $1 billion in sales. In November 2013, W.B. Mason partnered with Lyreco to provide worldwide delivery options to multi-national customers. [9]
Founder[edit]

William Betts Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1865. After his father's death in 1871, he immigrated to the United States with his grandmother Agnes Dunn Bettridge, mother Janet C. Mason (née Bettridge) and sisters Sarah, Eliza, and Eadith Mason. In 1872 his family moved to Brockton, at the time known as North Bridgewater[10], to live with Janet's brother Arthur J. C. Bettridge. Mason's first occupation was as a counter maker and trimmer in Brockton [11].
He married his first wife Clara W. Belcher of Randolph, Massachusetts in 1892.[12] He continued to work in the counter making field until 1893, at which point he went to work for S.W.S. Howard, a local printing company.[13] In 1896 he left S.W.S. Howard and went into business for himself, making specialty brass plates, checks, and rubber stamps.
In 1898 Mason founded the W.B. Mason Company as a rubber stamp and stencil company. Still to this day, W.B. Mason manufactures its own rubber stamps. In December of 1905, Mason married his second wife, Marcena D. Horton of Bristol, Rhode Island[14] . She would go on to run the company from the time of Mason's death in 1912 until Samuel Kovner's acquisition of the company in the late 1920s.
Mason Passed away in 1912 due to heart failure. During his life, William Betts Mason sang around Brockton in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet, and was a member of the Brockton based Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. His final resting place is a half mile from W.B. Mason world headquarters at Union Cemetery on Centre Street in Brockton. Mason had no children in either marriage, but his legacy continues to live on through his company that's history spans three centuries.

W.B. Mason was founded in 1898 by William Betts Mason in Brockton, Massachusetts. Its world headquarters still remain in Brockton to this day. The company started as a business that sold printed products, engraved products, and rubber stamps.
As the city of Brockton expanded in the early 20th century, largely due to the shoe industry, W.B. Mason, too, expanded its sales offerings to include office supplies.
W.B. Mason has continued as a family owned and operated business since its founding. William Betts Mason ran the company until his death in 1912. The Mason family continued to oversee the company until the 1920s under William's wife, Marcena. In the late 1920s W.B. Mason was sold to an employee and Brockton businessman, Samuel Kovner, who started his career out by sweeping the floors at W.B. Mason as a boy.
Under Kovner, the company reached sales of $243,000. In 1963 Kovner sold the company to his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Joseph Greene. The Greenes added furniture sales to the company's selection and the W.B. Mason Company reached nearly a million dollars in sales upon Mr. Greene's passing in 1973. After his death, their son Steve Greene took over leadership of the company. In 1983 Steve Greene and his brother, John Greene, officially took over ownership from their mother. They invited the two top sales representatives, Leo Meehan and Thomas Golden to join the ownership group. By 1993, under Steve Greene's leadership, the company grew to $20 million in sales. In 1993 Steve Greene replaced his mother Helen Greene as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Upon Greene's appointment to the board, Leo Meehan became the President and CEO of the company. Under Meehan's guidance, the company adopted a new corporate strategy focused on localized service, personalized solutions, and free delivery. Under this new model, W.B. Mason reached sales of $247 million by 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, the company reached $1 billion in sales. In November 2013, W.B. Mason partnered with Lyreco to provide worldwide delivery options to multi-national customers. [9]

William Betts Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1865. After his father's death in 1871, he immigrated to the United States with his grandmother Agnes Dunn Bettridge, mother Janet C. Mason (née Bettridge) and sisters Sarah, Eliza, and Eadith Mason. In 1872 his family moved to Brockton, at the time known as North Bridgewater[10], to live with Janet's brother Arthur J. C. Bettridge. Mason's first occupation was as a counter maker and trimmer in Brockton [11].
He married his first wife Clara W. Belcher of Randolph, Massachusetts in 1892.[12] He continued to work in the counter making field until 1893, at which point he went to work for S.W.S. Howard, a local printing company.[13] In 1896 he left S.W.S. Howard and went into business for himself, making specialty brass plates, checks, and rubber stamps.
In 1898 Mason founded the W.B. Mason Company as a rubber stamp and stencil company. Still to this day, W.B. Mason manufactures its own rubber stamps. In December of 1905, Mason married his second wife, Marcena D. Horton of Bristol, Rhode Island[14] . She would go on to run the company from the time of Mason's death in 1912 until Samuel Kovner's acquisition of the company in the late 1920s.
Mason Passed away in 1912 due to heart failure. During his life, William Betts Mason sang around Brockton in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet, and was a member of the Brockton based Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. His final resting place is a half mile from W.B. Mason world headquarters at Union Cemetery on Centre Street in Brockton. Mason had no children in either marriage, but his legacy continues to live on through his company that's history spans three centuries.

Advertising[edit]




W.B. Mason Logo






A W.B. Mason Blizzard copy paper box is featured on the poster for the 2014 Academy Award recipient Spotlight.


In 1986 the company introduced its iconic slogan, "Who But W.B. Mason". Later, the slogan was combined with a portrait from the 1890s of founder William Betts Mason to synthesize their current corporate logo. The logo features two U.S. flags flanking the portrait of W.B. Mason. The flag on the right has 50 stars to represent the current state of the union, but the one on the left shows only 45 stars, the configuration at the time of the company's founding in 1898. In 1997 W.B. Mason began advertising on television. Its inaugural commercial was played during the 1997 Super Bowl. Besides their commercials, their fully decorated trucks and baseball park signage serve as W.B. Mason's primary forms of advertising. Both their trucks and baseball park sinage have become an iconic part of their brand and have been spotted in many movies and on local network television.

Philanthropy[edit]
The W.B. Mason Company strives to follow in its founder footprints by playing an active role in the Brockton community. William Betts Mason believed that being involved in his community would help to contribute to the strength and vitality of Brockton. During his life he was involved in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet and the Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. Both of these groups allowed him to be a more productive member of Brockton. The Company to this day still tries to live up to Mason's commitment by giving back to many of Brockton institutions.
Projects[edit]
In June of 2017 W.B. Mason announced a $10 million donation toward the Leo J. Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. Meehan, president and CEO of W.B. Mason, is an alumnus of the college. This was the second largest donation in the school's history. The business school will open in August 2019. It will house Stonehill’s accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, economics and healthcare administration programs.[16] Stonehill College is located less than five miles from W.B. Mason world headquarters in Brockton.
In 2007 W.B. Mason donated $1 million toward the Helen Greene Cardiac Catheterization Suite at local Brockton Hospital. The cardiac suite is equipped with the most advanced technology to perform Intravascular Ultrasounds, AngioJets, Radial Stenting, Advanced X-Rays, and more. The suite was named after Helen Greene, who was a former owner, and is the mother of current Chairman Steve Greene and President of the Office Products Division John Greene.[17]
W.B. Mason was a platinum benefactor in the opening of the Trinity Catholic Academy in Brockton, Massachusetts.[18] Trinity Catholic Academy is the amalgamation of the schools of three Catholic parishes in Brockton. St. Edward, St. Casimir, and Sacred Heart Parishes operated independent Catholic schools in the greater Brockton area that were faced with declining enrollment, deteriorating facilities, and financial troubles.[19] Trinity Catholic Academy was opened to preserve the option of Catholic education for the greater Brockton community.
W.B. Mason was the primary donor to W.B. Mason Stadium, Stonehill College's football, lacrosse, field hockey, and track & field stadium. W.B. Mason Stadium opened for the 2005 season.[20] The special relationship with Stonehill is largely due to the significant number of Stonehill alumni employed by W.B. Mason.
Locations[edit]
W.B. Mason has over 60 distribution centers in the United States, and provides nationwide delivery services to its customers. Through its partnership with Lyreco it has worldwide distribution capabilities.

History[edit]




W.B. Mason Head Quarters
Brockton, Massachusetts
(September 2011)



W.B. Mason was founded in 1898 by William Betts Mason in Brockton, Massachusetts. Its world headquarters still remain in Brockton to this day. The company started as a business that sold printed products, engraved products, and rubber stamps.
As the city of Brockton expanded in the early 20th century, largely due to the shoe industry, W.B. Mason, too, expanded its sales offerings to include office supplies.
W.B. Mason has continued as a family owned and operated business since its founding. William Betts Mason ran the company until his death in 1912. The Mason family continued to oversee the company until the 1920s under William's wife, Marcena. In the late 1920s W.B. Mason was sold to an employee and Brockton businessman, Samuel Kovner, who started his career out by sweeping the floors at W.B. Mason as a boy.
Under Kovner, the company reached sales of $243,000. In 1963 Kovner sold the company to his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Joseph Greene. The Greenes added furniture sales to the company's selection and the W.B. Mason Company reached nearly a million dollars in sales upon Mr. Greene's passing in 1973. After his death, their son Steve Greene took over leadership of the company. In 1983 Steve Greene and his brother, John Greene, officially took over ownership from their mother. They invited the two top sales representatives, Leo Meehan and Thomas Golden to join the ownership group. By 1993, under Steve Greene's leadership, the company grew to $20 million in sales. In 1993 Steve Greene replaced his mother Helen Greene as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Upon Greene's appointment to the board, Leo Meehan became the President and CEO of the company. Under Meehan's guidance, the company adopted a new corporate strategy focused on localized service, personalized solutions, and free delivery. Under this new model, W.B. Mason reached sales of $247 million by 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, the company reached $1 billion in sales. In November 2013, W.B. Mason partnered with Lyreco to provide worldwide delivery options to multi-national customers. [9]
Founder[edit]

William Betts Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1865. After his father's death in 1871, he immigrated to the United States with his grandmother Agnes Dunn Bettridge, mother Janet C. Mason (née Bettridge) and sisters Sarah, Eliza, and Eadith Mason. In 1872 his family moved to Brockton, at the time known as North Bridgewater[10], to live with Janet's brother Arthur J. C. Bettridge. Mason's first occupation was as a counter maker and trimmer in Brockton [11].
He married his first wife Clara W. Belcher of Randolph, Massachusetts in 1892.[12] He continued to work in the counter making field until 1893, at which point he went to work for S.W.S. Howard, a local printing company.[13] In 1896 he left S.W.S. Howard and went into business for himself, making specialty brass plates, checks, and rubber stamps.
In 1898 Mason founded the W.B. Mason Company as a rubber stamp and stencil company. Still to this day, W.B. Mason manufactures its own rubber stamps. In December of 1905, Mason married his second wife, Marcena D. Horton of Bristol, Rhode Island[14] . She would go on to run the company from the time of Mason's death in 1912 until Samuel Kovner's acquisition of the company in the late 1920s.
Mason Passed away in 1912 due to heart failure. During his life, William Betts Mason sang around Brockton in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet, and was a member of the Brockton based Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. His final resting place is a half mile from W.B. Mason world headquarters at Union Cemetery on Centre Street in Brockton. Mason had no children in either marriage, but his legacy continues to live on through his company that's history spans three centuries.

W.B. Mason Logo






A W.B. Mason Blizzard copy paper box is featured on the poster for the 2014 Academy Award recipient Spotlight.


In 1986 the company introduced its iconic slogan, "Who But W.B. Mason". Later, the slogan was combined with a portrait from the 1890s of founder William Betts Mason to synthesize their current corporate logo. The logo features two U.S. flags flanking the portrait of W.B. Mason. The flag on the right has 50 stars to represent the current state of the union, but the one on the left shows only 45 stars, the configuration at the time of the company's founding in 1898. In 1997 W.B. Mason began advertising on television. Its inaugural commercial was played during the 1997 Super Bowl. Besides their commercials, their fully decorated trucks and baseball park signage serve as W.B. Mason's primary forms of advertising. Both their trucks and baseball park sinage have become an iconic part of their brand and have been spotted in many movies and on local network television.

Other Forms of Sponsorship[edit]
W.B. Mason also has sponsorships with Madison Square Garden in New York City, Foxwoods Resort & Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut as well as with the Boston Bruins and New England Patriots.
Philanthropy[edit]
The W.B. Mason Company strives to follow in its founder footprints by playing an active role in the Brockton community. William Betts Mason believed that being involved in his community would help to contribute to the strength and vitality of Brockton. During his life he was involved in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet and the Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. Both of these groups allowed him to be a more productive member of Brockton. The Company to this day still tries to live up to Mason's commitment by giving back to many of Brockton institutions.
Projects[edit]
In June of 2017 W.B. Mason announced a $10 million donation toward the Leo J. Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. Meehan, president and CEO of W.B. Mason, is an alumnus of the college. This was the second largest donation in the school's history. The business school will open in August 2019. It will house Stonehill’s accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, economics and healthcare administration programs.[16] Stonehill College is located less than five miles from W.B. Mason world headquarters in Brockton.
In 2007 W.B. Mason donated $1 million toward the Helen Greene Cardiac Catheterization Suite at local Brockton Hospital. The cardiac suite is equipped with the most advanced technology to perform Intravascular Ultrasounds, AngioJets, Radial Stenting, Advanced X-Rays, and more. The suite was named after Helen Greene, who was a former owner, and is the mother of current Chairman Steve Greene and President of the Office Products Division John Greene.[17]
W.B. Mason was a platinum benefactor in the opening of the Trinity Catholic Academy in Brockton, Massachusetts.[18] Trinity Catholic Academy is the amalgamation of the schools of three Catholic parishes in Brockton. St. Edward, St. Casimir, and Sacred Heart Parishes operated independent Catholic schools in the greater Brockton area that were faced with declining enrollment, deteriorating facilities, and financial troubles.[19] Trinity Catholic Academy was opened to preserve the option of Catholic education for the greater Brockton community.
W.B. Mason was the primary donor to W.B. Mason Stadium, Stonehill College's football, lacrosse, field hockey, and track & field stadium. W.B. Mason Stadium opened for the 2005 season.[20] The special relationship with Stonehill is largely due to the significant number of Stonehill alumni employed by W.B. Mason.
Locations[edit]
W.B. Mason has over 60 distribution centers in the United States, and provides nationwide delivery services to its customers. Through its partnership with Lyreco it has worldwide distribution capabilities.

Other Forms of Sponsorship[edit]
W.B. Mason also has sponsorships with Madison Square Garden in New York City, Foxwoods Resort & Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut as well as with the Boston Bruins and New England Patriots.
Philanthropy[edit]
The W.B. Mason Company strives to follow in its founder footprints by playing an active role in the Brockton community. William Betts Mason believed that being involved in his community would help to contribute to the strength and vitality of Brockton. During his life he was involved in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet and the Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. Both of these groups allowed him to be a more productive member of Brockton. The Company to this day still tries to live up to Mason's commitment by giving back to many of Brockton institutions.
Projects[edit]
In June of 2017 W.B. Mason announced a $10 million donation toward the Leo J. Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. Meehan, president and CEO of W.B. Mason, is an alumnus of the college. This was the second largest donation in the school's history. The business school will open in August 2019. It will house Stonehill’s accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, economics and healthcare administration programs.[16] Stonehill College is located less than five miles from W.B. Mason world headquarters in Brockton.
In 2007 W.B. Mason donated $1 million toward the Helen Greene Cardiac Catheterization Suite at local Brockton Hospital. The cardiac suite is equipped with the most advanced technology to perform Intravascular Ultrasounds, AngioJets, Radial Stenting, Advanced X-Rays, and more. The suite was named after Helen Greene, who was a former owner, and is the mother of current Chairman Steve Greene and President of the Office Products Division John Greene.[17]
W.B. Mason was a platinum benefactor in the opening of the Trinity Catholic Academy in Brockton, Massachusetts.[18] Trinity Catholic Academy is the amalgamation of the schools of three Catholic parishes in Brockton. St. Edward, St. Casimir, and Sacred Heart Parishes operated independent Catholic schools in the greater Brockton area that were faced with declining enrollment, deteriorating facilities, and financial troubles.[19] Trinity Catholic Academy was opened to preserve the option of Catholic education for the greater Brockton community.
W.B. Mason was the primary donor to W.B. Mason Stadium, Stonehill College's football, lacrosse, field hockey, and track & field stadium. W.B. Mason Stadium opened for the 2005 season.[20] The special relationship with Stonehill is largely due to the significant number of Stonehill alumni employed by W.B. Mason.
Locations[edit]
W.B. Mason has over 60 distribution centers in the United States, and provides nationwide delivery services to its customers. Through its partnership with Lyreco it has worldwide distribution capabilities.

History[edit]




W.B. Mason Head Quarters
Brockton, Massachusetts
(September 2011)



W.B. Mason was founded in 1898 by William Betts Mason in Brockton, Massachusetts. Its world headquarters still remain in Brockton to this day. The company started as a business that sold printed products, engraved products, and rubber stamps.
As the city of Brockton expanded in the early 20th century, largely due to the shoe industry, W.B. Mason, too, expanded its sales offerings to include office supplies.
W.B. Mason has continued as a family owned and operated business since its founding. William Betts Mason ran the company until his death in 1912. The Mason family continued to oversee the company until the 1920s under William's wife, Marcena. In the late 1920s W.B. Mason was sold to an employee and Brockton businessman, Samuel Kovner, who started his career out by sweeping the floors at W.B. Mason as a boy.
Under Kovner, the company reached sales of $243,000. In 1963 Kovner sold the company to his daughter and son-in-law, Helen and Joseph Greene. The Greenes added furniture sales to the company's selection and the W.B. Mason Company reached nearly a million dollars in sales upon Mr. Greene's passing in 1973. After his death, their son Steve Greene took over leadership of the company. In 1983 Steve Greene and his brother, John Greene, officially took over ownership from their mother. They invited the two top sales representatives, Leo Meehan and Thomas Golden to join the ownership group. By 1993, under Steve Greene's leadership, the company grew to $20 million in sales. In 1993 Steve Greene replaced his mother Helen Greene as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Upon Greene's appointment to the board, Leo Meehan became the President and CEO of the company. Under Meehan's guidance, the company adopted a new corporate strategy focused on localized service, personalized solutions, and free delivery. Under this new model, W.B. Mason reached sales of $247 million by 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, the company reached $1 billion in sales. In November 2013, W.B. Mason partnered with Lyreco to provide worldwide delivery options to multi-national customers. [9]
Founder[edit]

William Betts Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1865. After his father's death in 1871, he immigrated to the United States with his grandmother Agnes Dunn Bettridge, mother Janet C. Mason (née Bettridge) and sisters Sarah, Eliza, and Eadith Mason. In 1872 his family moved to Brockton, at the time known as North Bridgewater[10], to live with Janet's brother Arthur J. C. Bettridge. Mason's first occupation was as a counter maker and trimmer in Brockton [11].
He married his first wife Clara W. Belcher of Randolph, Massachusetts in 1892.[12] He continued to work in the counter making field until 1893, at which point he went to work for S.W.S. Howard, a local printing company.[13] In 1896 he left S.W.S. Howard and went into business for himself, making specialty brass plates, checks, and rubber stamps.
In 1898 Mason founded the W.B. Mason Company as a rubber stamp and stencil company. Still to this day, W.B. Mason manufactures its own rubber stamps. In December of 1905, Mason married his second wife, Marcena D. Horton of Bristol, Rhode Island[14] . She would go on to run the company from the time of Mason's death in 1912 until Samuel Kovner's acquisition of the company in the late 1920s.
Mason Passed away in 1912 due to heart failure. During his life, William Betts Mason sang around Brockton in the Gerrish Male Barbershop Quartet, and was a member of the Brockton based Paul Revere Lodge of Freemasons. His final resting place is a half mile from W.B. Mason world headquarters at Union Cemetery on Centre Street in Brockton. Mason had no children in either marriage, but his legacy continues to live on through his company that's history spans three centuries.

Advertising[edit]




W.B. Mason Logo






A W.B. Mason Blizzard copy paper box is featured on the poster for the 2014 Academy Award recipient Spotlight.


In 1986 the company introduced its iconic slogan, "Who But W.B. Mason". Later, the slogan was combined with a portrait from the 1890s of founder William Betts Mason to synthesize their current corporate logo. The logo features two U.S. flags flanking the portrait of W.B. Mason. The flag on the right has 50 stars to represent the current state of the union, but the one on the left shows only 45 stars, the configuration at the time of the company's founding in 1898. In 1997 W.B. Mason began advertising on television. Its inaugural commercial was played during the 1997 Super Bowl. Besides their commercials, their fully decorated trucks and baseball park signage serve as W.B. Mason's primary forms of advertising. Both their trucks and baseball park sinage have become an iconic part of their brand and have been spotted in many movies and on local network television.
