History[edit]
BCP was founded in 1985 by Jardim Gonçalves and a group of investors from the Porto region.
Since 2004, it operates a branch brand dubbed and restyled as Millennium BCP, following a process of amalgamating all the brand names and complete incorporation of all commercial structures of the group's retail banking:

Nova Rede (the bank's brand for its own network of retail banking branches since 1989)
Crédibanco (network of branches created by the BCP itself in 1993)
Banco Português do Atlântico (acquired in 1995 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Mello (acquired in 2000 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Sotto Mayor (acquired in 2000)

Aborted merger with BPI (2007)[edit]
On 25 October 2007, a smaller Portuguese bank, BPI - Banco Português de Investimento ("Portuguese Investment Bank") offered a merger with BCP. The board of BCP initially refused as long as terms were not be revised. The merger talks failed and the two banks didn't reach an agreement.
Former operations in Canada[edit]
Bank of Montreal (BMO) purchased the Canadian division of BCP Bank in the summer of 2007. All branches in Canada remained BCP Bank branches until October 2007, when they became BMO branches. These branches continue to operate as specialty branches to Lusophone communities, including Azorean communities in Toronto, Ontario, except the Dundas Street West and University Avenue branches, which have turned towards the Chinese community.
Insolvency and state bailout[edit]
In the middle of the European sovereign debt crisis, Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp close last year with a core tier of 9,4%, beyond EU/IMF demands for 2011, but it was planning to raise more than that.[3] CEO Nuno Amado told reporters after presenting first-quarter results the bank planned to “reinforce its capital beyond the minimum requirements” via a cash call and by resorting to a recapitalisation line for banks under Portugal's €78-bn EU/IMF bailout. He said the bank would rely more on the recapitalisation line than on cash call, but would not give more details. Analysts have said BCP needs around €3bn in new capital to meet the 9% target set by the European Banking Authority, but the raising rescue value, in line with neighbouring Spain bank Bankia, prompted fears of a deeper crisis in the Portuguese bank. On June 7, 2012, the bank was rescued by the Portuguese Government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho, through 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it toke from the country's IMF/EU bailout package.[4]
Shareholder structure[edit]
As of 14 May 2017, BCP's main shareholders are Fosun International with 23.92%, Sonangol Group with 15.24%, Norges Bank with 2.19%, BlackRock with 2.04%, EDP - Energias de Portugal with 2.00%, Credit Suisse with 1.30% and Millennium Management with 0.121% [5]
Operations in Poland[edit]




A branch of Bank Millennium in Poland


Bank Millennium is BCP's network of branches in Poland. Bank Millennium was founded in 1989 when the Polish free market and democratic political transformations started. The bank was the first financial institution quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (1992) and gained its present scale through mergers with other banks (in 1992 and 1997), as well as organic growth supported by the new business model, which has been developed in co-operation with its owner - the Portuguese bank Millennium BCP, which holds 51% of its shares. Bank Millennium, together with its subsidiaries in Poland, provides specialized financial services such as leasing, brokerage, and mutual funds, which makes it one of the largest banking groups in Poland.
Controversies[edit]
In 2007, Millennium BCP faced turmoil amid probes of its accounts by Portuguese financial crime investigators, the central bank (BdP - Banco de Portugal) and stock market authorities (CMVM - Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários). The preliminary findings of an investigation by the CMVM stock market authority alleged the existence of several off-shore companies which Millennium BCP could have used to buy its own shares when it increased its capital in 2000 and 2001. The investigations were launched as a result of a complaint by a leading shareholder, José "Joe" Berardo, who owns 6.8% of the bank. He provided crime investigators with documents which, he alleged, showed that several offences had been committed. The documents provided by Berardo are said to prove various cases of fraud committed by various members of past boards of directors at the bank. The Economic Corruption and Financial Crime Investigative Committee, Direcção-Central de Investigação da Corrupção e Criminalidade Económica e Financeira (DCICCEF), was also to call Berardo, former temporary CEO Filipe Pinhal, former Chairman Jardim Gonçalves, shareholder Goês Ferreira, and former ousted CEO Paulo Teixeira Pinto, amongst others, to give or answer to evidence.

The documents provided by Berardo are said to prove various cases of fraud committed by various members of past boards of directors at the bank. The Economic Corruption and Financial Crime Investigative Committee, Direcção-Central de Investigação da Corrupção e Criminalidade Económica e Financeira (DCICCEF), was also to call Berardo, former temporary CEO Filipe Pinhal, former Chairman Jardim Gonçalves, shareholder Goês Ferreira, and former ousted CEO Paulo Teixeira Pinto, amongst others, to give or answer to evidence.

History[edit]
BCP was founded in 1985 by Jardim Gonçalves and a group of investors from the Porto region.
Since 2004, it operates a branch brand dubbed and restyled as Millennium BCP, following a process of amalgamating all the brand names and complete incorporation of all commercial structures of the group's retail banking:

Nova Rede (the bank's brand for its own network of retail banking branches since 1989)
Crédibanco (network of branches created by the BCP itself in 1993)
Banco Português do Atlântico (acquired in 1995 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Mello (acquired in 2000 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Sotto Mayor (acquired in 2000)

Aborted merger with BPI (2007)[edit]
On 25 October 2007, a smaller Portuguese bank, BPI - Banco Português de Investimento ("Portuguese Investment Bank") offered a merger with BCP. The board of BCP initially refused as long as terms were not be revised. The merger talks failed and the two banks didn't reach an agreement.
Former operations in Canada[edit]
Bank of Montreal (BMO) purchased the Canadian division of BCP Bank in the summer of 2007. All branches in Canada remained BCP Bank branches until October 2007, when they became BMO branches. These branches continue to operate as specialty branches to Lusophone communities, including Azorean communities in Toronto, Ontario, except the Dundas Street West and University Avenue branches, which have turned towards the Chinese community.
Insolvency and state bailout[edit]
In the middle of the European sovereign debt crisis, Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp close last year with a core tier of 9,4%, beyond EU/IMF demands for 2011, but it was planning to raise more than that.[3] CEO Nuno Amado told reporters after presenting first-quarter results the bank planned to “reinforce its capital beyond the minimum requirements” via a cash call and by resorting to a recapitalisation line for banks under Portugal's €78-bn EU/IMF bailout. He said the bank would rely more on the recapitalisation line than on cash call, but would not give more details. Analysts have said BCP needs around €3bn in new capital to meet the 9% target set by the European Banking Authority, but the raising rescue value, in line with neighbouring Spain bank Bankia, prompted fears of a deeper crisis in the Portuguese bank. On June 7, 2012, the bank was rescued by the Portuguese Government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho, through 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it toke from the country's IMF/EU bailout package.[4]
Shareholder structure[edit]
As of 14 May 2017, BCP's main shareholders are Fosun International with 23.92%, Sonangol Group with 15.24%, Norges Bank with 2.19%, BlackRock with 2.04%, EDP - Energias de Portugal with 2.00%, Credit Suisse with 1.30% and Millennium Management with 0.121% [5]
Operations in Poland[edit]




A branch of Bank Millennium in Poland


Bank Millennium is BCP's network of branches in Poland. Bank Millennium was founded in 1989 when the Polish free market and democratic political transformations started. The bank was the first financial institution quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (1992) and gained its present scale through mergers with other banks (in 1992 and 1997), as well as organic growth supported by the new business model, which has been developed in co-operation with its owner - the Portuguese bank Millennium BCP, which holds 51% of its shares. Bank Millennium, together with its subsidiaries in Poland, provides specialized financial services such as leasing, brokerage, and mutual funds, which makes it one of the largest banking groups in Poland.
Controversies[edit]
In 2007, Millennium BCP faced turmoil amid probes of its accounts by Portuguese financial crime investigators, the central bank (BdP - Banco de Portugal) and stock market authorities (CMVM - Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários). The preliminary findings of an investigation by the CMVM stock market authority alleged the existence of several off-shore companies which Millennium BCP could have used to buy its own shares when it increased its capital in 2000 and 2001. The investigations were launched as a result of a complaint by a leading shareholder, José "Joe" Berardo, who owns 6.8% of the bank. He provided crime investigators with documents which, he alleged, showed that several offences had been committed. The documents provided by Berardo are said to prove various cases of fraud committed by various members of past boards of directors at the bank. The Economic Corruption and Financial Crime Investigative Committee, Direcção-Central de Investigação da Corrupção e Criminalidade Económica e Financeira (DCICCEF), was also to call Berardo, former temporary CEO Filipe Pinhal, former Chairman Jardim Gonçalves, shareholder Goês Ferreira, and former ousted CEO Paulo Teixeira Pinto, amongst others, to give or answer to evidence.

Banco Comercial Português (BCP) (English: Portuguese Commercial Bank), is a Portuguese bank that was founded in 1985 and is the largest private bank in the country. BCP is a member of the Euronext 100 stock index and its current chief executive officer is Nuno Manuel da Silva Amado. BCP is based in Porto, but its operations are headquartered in Oeiras, Greater Lisbon. It operates a branch brand dubbed and restyled in 2004 as Millennium BCP as well as Banque BCP and ActivoBank.
It has nearly 4.3 million customers throughout the world and over 900 branches in Portugal. In 2008, it reported a profit of €201 million. It was ranked at number 453 in the 2007 Forbes Global 2000 list. However, by 2012, the bank was in deep financial stress and had to be rescued by a state bailout of 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it took from the country's IMF/EU bailout package.

History[edit]
BCP was founded in 1985 by Jardim Gonçalves and a group of investors from the Porto region.
Since 2004, it operates a branch brand dubbed and restyled as Millennium BCP, following a process of amalgamating all the brand names and complete incorporation of all commercial structures of the group's retail banking:

Nova Rede (the bank's brand for its own network of retail banking branches since 1989)
Crédibanco (network of branches created by the BCP itself in 1993)
Banco Português do Atlântico (acquired in 1995 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Mello (acquired in 2000 and incorporated in 2000)
Banco Sotto Mayor (acquired in 2000)

Aborted merger with BPI (2007)[edit]
On 25 October 2007, a smaller Portuguese bank, BPI - Banco Português de Investimento ("Portuguese Investment Bank") offered a merger with BCP. The board of BCP initially refused as long as terms were not be revised. The merger talks failed and the two banks didn't reach an agreement.
Former operations in Canada[edit]
Bank of Montreal (BMO) purchased the Canadian division of BCP Bank in the summer of 2007. All branches in Canada remained BCP Bank branches until October 2007, when they became BMO branches. These branches continue to operate as specialty branches to Lusophone communities, including Azorean communities in Toronto, Ontario, except the Dundas Street West and University Avenue branches, which have turned towards the Chinese community.
Insolvency and state bailout[edit]
In the middle of the European sovereign debt crisis, Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp close last year with a core tier of 9,4%, beyond EU/IMF demands for 2011, but it was planning to raise more than that.[3] CEO Nuno Amado told reporters after presenting first-quarter results the bank planned to “reinforce its capital beyond the minimum requirements” via a cash call and by resorting to a recapitalisation line for banks under Portugal's €78-bn EU/IMF bailout. He said the bank would rely more on the recapitalisation line than on cash call, but would not give more details. Analysts have said BCP needs around €3bn in new capital to meet the 9% target set by the European Banking Authority, but the raising rescue value, in line with neighbouring Spain bank Bankia, prompted fears of a deeper crisis in the Portuguese bank. On June 7, 2012, the bank was rescued by the Portuguese Government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho, through 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in state funds it toke from the country's IMF/EU bailout package.[4]
Shareholder structure[edit]
As of 14 May 2017, BCP's main shareholders are Fosun International with 23.92%, Sonangol Group with 15.24%, Norges Bank with 2.19%, BlackRock with 2.04%, EDP - Energias de Portugal with 2.00%, Credit Suisse with 1.30% and Millennium Management with 0.121% [5]
Operations in Poland[edit]




A branch of Bank Millennium in Poland


Bank Millennium is BCP's network of branches in Poland. Bank Millennium was founded in 1989 when the Polish free market and democratic political transformations started. The bank was the first financial institution quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (1992) and gained its present scale through mergers with other banks (in 1992 and 1997), as well as organic growth supported by the new business model, which has been developed in co-operation with its owner - the Portuguese bank Millennium BCP, which holds 51% of its shares. Bank Millennium, together with its subsidiaries in Poland, provides specialized financial services such as leasing, brokerage, and mutual funds, which makes it one of the largest banking groups in Poland.
Controversies[edit]
In 2007, Millennium BCP faced turmoil amid probes of its accounts by Portuguese financial crime investigators, the central bank (BdP - Banco de Portugal) and stock market authorities (CMVM - Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários). The preliminary findings of an investigation by the CMVM stock market authority alleged the existence of several off-shore companies which Millennium BCP could have used to buy its own shares when it increased its capital in 2000 and 2001. The investigations were launched as a result of a complaint by a leading shareholder, José "Joe" Berardo, who owns 6.8% of the bank. He provided crime investigators with documents which, he alleged, showed that several offences had been committed. The documents provided by Berardo are said to prove various cases of fraud committed by various members of past boards of directors at the bank. The Economic Corruption and Financial Crime Investigative Committee, Direcção-Central de Investigação da Corrupção e Criminalidade Económica e Financeira (DCICCEF), was also to call Berardo, former temporary CEO Filipe Pinhal, former Chairman Jardim Gonçalves, shareholder Goês Ferreira, and former ousted CEO Paulo Teixeira Pinto, amongst others, to give or answer to evidence.

						I talked to my fiance in Chinese! My fiance is native Chinese and we could only talk in English...
						I even been to China 4 (!!) times and couldn't pick it up straight... After a month, finishing
						level 1 of Rosetta Stone Mandarin - I learn to talk with her, and most important, I learned how
						to tell her the most important thing of all: Wo ai ni. (I love you). :-)

						I went to Mexico for a holiday and took small children's toys and crafts to leave for the maid at
						the resort in addition to her tips. I was pleased to discover that I knew enough to ask her about
						her hijos/hijas and understand she had a new baby girl who was four months old.I can hardly wait until
						our next Mexican holiday when I will know much more Spanish! I love Rosetta Stone!
						- Susan
 5 out of 5 stars




						It was exciting to be able to recognize words in conversations when I visited Disney World.
						I look forward to getting back to my computer each day to learn more, and can't wait until I
						have my first conversation in Portuguese. The online games with Rosetta Stone are a fun way
						to practice listening comprehension. I am loving learning a new language this way!

 5 out of 5 stars




						It was in an ATM in Kyoto, Japan. The machine blocked my International Credit Card inside and an attendant
						called on the intercom. She was sorry for not speaking in english or portuguese, but ready to help if I
						can speak in Japanese. And I did it! Remembering some Rosetta Stone lessons, I was able to explain my
						situation and recover my credit card from the machine. Thank you Rosetta Stone!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
