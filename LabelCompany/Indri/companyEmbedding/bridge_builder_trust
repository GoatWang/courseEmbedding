Welcome to Bridge Builder Mutual Funds
New Literature
Bridge Builder mutual funds, available exclusively through Edward Jones Advisory Solutions®, provide investors diversified expertise from leading asset management firms. We select multiple asset managers (sub-advisers) for each fund, with each sub-adviser responsible for investing a portion of the fund.
Our Investment Philosophy
The management of Bridge Builder mutual funds is rooted in Bridge Builder's investment philosophy.

Diversification – This can help reduce investment risks over time.
Long-term approach – Taking a long-term view is an effort to align with our clients' best interests. We believe investing based on long-term expectations, rather than short-term speculation, provides the best opportunity for success.
High quality – While some risk is necessary to achieve a desirable return, our goal with Bridge Builder funds is to have similar or less risk than that of comparable alternatives. We believe lower risk can ultimately lead to better client outcomes that generally come with staying invested.

Our Manager Selection Process
We strive to select diverse sub-advisers that have complementary investment styles, performance patterns and portfolio characteristics. We seek to invest in high-quality strategies that are proven with a track record of success. We select sub-advisers we expect to utilize for the long term.
While each sub-adviser brings specific expertise to the overall portfolio, we look for certain characteristics in every manager we consider:

Experienced, well-resourced team
Sensible, repeatable investment process
Portfolio characteristics that fit the team's investment philosophy
Demonstrated track record of success

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. The value of your investment in the Fund could go down as well as up. Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, credit, interest-rate, liquidity and reinvestment risk. Investments in asset-backed, mortgage-related and mortgage- backed securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, prepayments and impairment of the value of the collateral underlying the security. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. The Fund may invest in non-U.S dollar-denominated foreign securities (including emerging markets), which may be more sensitive to currency fluctuations, political and economic instability, differing government regulations and liquidity risk. The Fund may also invest in derivatives which could increase the Fund's volatility. Multi-investment management styles may lead to overlapping securities transactions and higher transaction expenses compared to single investment management styles. Outcomes depend on the skill of the sub-advisers and adviser and the allocation of assets amongst them.
Before you invest in The Bridge Builder Funds, please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-855-823-3611. The prospectus should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money.

The Gross Expense Ratio, per the Fund's latest prospectus, includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained by calling 1-855-823-3611. Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Returns shown for the Fund include the reinvestment of all dividends, if any. Total return calculations reflect the effect of the Advisers fee waiver agreement for the Fund. If such fee waivers had not occurred, the quoted performance would be lower.

The Russell 1000® Value Index measures the performance of the large-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 1000® companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower expected growth values. The Russell 2500® Growth Index measures the performance of the small to mid-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe.

About us 

Who we are and what we do
Bridgebuilder is a Christian schools work charity that has been supporting schools in Milton Keynes for over 25 years. We currently visit over 100 primary and secondary schools across the city and surrounding villages to support schools with pupil’s spiritual, moral, social and cultural development as well as Christianity through religious education.
We enable pupils to explore positive values and the Christian faith, in accessible and memorable ways through assemblies, RE lessons and projects.
Our activities are interactive, fun, inspiring, and educational, using drama, games, group activities, personal reflection, stories, video clips and talks.  All of our services are inclusive and suitable for pupils and staff of all faiths and none.
We encourage pupils to explore their own values & beliefs by thinking through themes such as fear, honesty, peer pressure, generosity, respect, friendship & self-esteem.  We aim to empower all pupils regardless of faith or belief to think responsibly, build good character, reach their potential & positively impact their surroundings.
All of our services to schools are designed to support teachers with the Ofsted and curriculum requirements of Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC) development, collective worship through assemblies and Religious Education.  The core of our work is providing schools with assemblies, lessons, projects and off-timetable activities.  For a full list of current projects and services we offer schools please see our What we do in schools page.
 
Our focus is to help children and young people consider their beliefs, explore Christianity and make positive life choices.
We do this through our three objectives –
Educate    

We support children and young people’s education in Christian faith and values from a personal perspective.
We enable children and young people to explore the Christian faith in accessible and memorable ways through assemblies, RE, lessons and projects.
We communicate in a manner appropriate to children and young people of all faiths or no faith, encouraging them to explore their own values and beliefs.

Empower  

We seek to empower all children and young people regardless of faith or belief to think responsibly, reach their potential and make a positive impact on their surroundings.
We empower young Christians to be confident in their faith and be a positive influence.

Engage   

We believe children and young people of all backgrounds benefit from positive role models so we seek to use our connections with churches to engage suitable individuals in volunteer opportunities within their local school(s).
We engage young people with the Christian community by developing opportunities for them to visit local churches through a variety of projects.
We support the engagement of children and young people in their own communities through pro-active networking with children’s and youth workers.

Fun way to pass the time...


            Although on some levels the ad on the side is annoying, I've been able to just slide the screen over to get to the parts I need. It's simple mechanics, fun, a little challenging at times but not overly stressful to play which I like. Some added features would make game play a little more user friendly, such as the different materials making different colored lines so it's easier to differentiate between them after building a large complicated bridge. Maybe a back/undo button to quickly remove the last line, for unwanted lines that sometimes happen. Having to click the drop down menu, select remove, then click the line, then select drop down menu again then draw to get started again gets tedious at times. Overall the simple graphics and animations don't bother me. It gets the point across, is still fun. I enjoy passing the tablet between friends to see how they handle different bridge challenges. There are many ways to complete each level which I like.

Marvelous


            The graphics are amazing and I love the detail of the truck going through the ground its absolutely marvelous... (only good thing is the amount of levels but I'm not doing the same bridge design for 50 backgrounds)

Good, but not great.


            CONS
First, then you get to level 23, the ads on the right will block you from being able to complete the bridge, unless you pay money to remove it. That needs to be fixed, or list game as free trial.

Second, it doesn't follow too closely to real life physics. The structures that you can build will be impossible in real life to exist under their own weight, but in the game will support the truck driving across. Therefore, you need to practice to study the game's own laws of physics, which do change some times.

Third, the game doesn't stick to its own laws of physics throughout. In one level, you can use one design over a large gap, but in the next map the same design might not work over a smaller gap, when it should.

Fourth, once you have enough money, you can cover almost all the levels up to 23 with just making two rows below the deck of square blocks with cross pieces in the shape of a "X" running through them.

PROS
Good for playing if you have nothing else to do.
Its free.

            Not all that bad. Simple graphics and was controls...but the tutorials need to be automatic or more obvious. Advertisements need to be shrunk and repositioned. Zoom control needs to be changed to pinch/pull instead of buttons, that would free up some room for more buttons. 4/5, would recommend. Best free Bridge Builder for the Windows phone.

Love it


            I love it but once you get up in the levels it closes on it own.  It is the only bad thing i have to say about it.
