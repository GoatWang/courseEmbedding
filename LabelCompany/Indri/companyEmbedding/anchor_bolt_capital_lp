 Educational Background



 
Class of 2001 


Columbia University - Columbia Business School

                  Columbia Business School (CBS) is the business school of Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City. It was established in 1916 to provide business training and professional preparation for undergraduate and graduate Columbia University students. It is one of six Ivy League business schools and its admission process is among the most selective of top business schools.                




 
Class of 1995 


University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.                





 Career History

                                    2011 - Current                


Anchor Bolt Capital LP


                  Anchor Bolt Capital's objective is to build a long/short equity business focused on the global industrial and energy markets that will generate sustained above-average, long-term, risk-adjusted results. The firm's investment strategy is based on fundamental research. Anchor Bolt seeks to generate consistent long and short alpha by combining deep industry and stock knowledge with rigorous financial analysis and value-added research. Within the industrial and energy world, the firm focuses on investments across at least 46 subsectors within at least four key categories: capital equipment, basic materials, energy and transportation.The firm's industry relative trades seek long exposure in subsectors with improving near-term fundamentals and/or positive secular forces and short exposure in subsectors with deteriorating near-term fundamentals and/or secular headwinds. Anchor Bolt’s subsector relative valuation analysis provides an objective framework for how sectors within the industrial and energy world trade relative to one another.Concentrated absolute value long positions seek to identify the greatest risk/reward opportunities across the funds's and separately managed account's investable universe, focusing on names that typically exhibit greater than 2X upside versus downside based on Anchor Bolt's bottom-up upside/downside price targets. Such stocks will generally be weighted towards companies with greater idiosyncratic growth rates that can be purchased at a reasonable price and/or companies that are trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value where Anchor Bolt has a constructive view on management’s allocation of capital.Subsector relative opportunities and industry relative trades will collectively make up a market neutral portfolio while the overlay of the long portfolio will result in a portfolio that in most cases operates net long. Portfolio construction is a dynamic and disciplined process in which Anchor Bolt seeks to optimize sources of alpha, while at the same time seeks to manage risk through disciplined levels of financial leverage and net exposures.^

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
