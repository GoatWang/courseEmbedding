                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Restricted
Shares . Each
Restricted Share vests on April 15, 2014 and is settled for
one common share. Vesting would accelerate upon a change in control
or if the recipient of the award were to die, become disabled or
retire in a qualifying retirement prior to the vesting date. In the
case of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, vesting would also
accelerate if we were to terminate him without cause, or if he were
to resign for good reason, under his employment agreement. We pay
dividend equivalents on Restricted Shares prior to the vesting
date.

 

 -2-

 

 

  

 

Performance
Units .
Performance units represent the right to earn common shares. The
number of common shares, if any, deliverable to award recipients
depends on our performance based on our total return to
shareholders during the three year period Measurement Period that
commenced on January 1, 2011 and that ends on the earlier of
December 31, 2013 or the date of a change of control, as
defined in our 2011-2013 Restricted Performance Share Unit Program
(the “Performance Unit Program”) compared to the total
return to shareholders for the Measurement Period of the real
estate investment trusts included in the MSCI US REIT Index’s
gross index (the “Index REITs”). If our total return to
shareholders over the Measurement Period places us below the 25th
percentile of the Index REITs, then no shares will be earned. If
our total return to shareholders over the Measurement Period places
us at or above the 25th percentile of the Index REITs, then a
percentage of the awards ranging from 50% to 200% will be earned.
Dividends are deemed credited to the performance units accounts and
are applied to acquire more performance units for the account of
the unit holder at the price per common share ending on the
dividend payment date. If earned, awards will be paid in common
shares in an amount equal to the number of performance units in the
holder’s account at the end of the Measurement Period.
Participants in the program may elect to defer receipt of common
shares earned into our Deferred Compensation Plan. In the event of
the participant’s death, disability or qualifying retirement,
he will be eligible to receive shares (if any) under the program as
if the Measurement Period ended on the last day of the month in
which the termination occurred.

Options.
Each
Option has a per share exercise price of $11.89 (equal to the
closing price of our common shares on March 2, 2011), vests
ratably over three years and has a ten-year term. Vesting of the
Options would accelerate upon the same events that would trigger
accelerated vesting of the Restricted Shares.

The grants
of Restricted Shares, Performance Units and Options were made under
our Amended and Restated 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The award
agreements for the Restricted Shares, Performance Units and Options
will be individualized for each recipient and will be in
substantially the forms attached as exhibits to this Form
8-K.

BRANDYWINE
REALTY TRUST
AMENDED AND RESTATED 1997 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

RESTRICTED
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS
AWARD AGREEMENT

ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE
2011-2013 RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT PROGRAM

This
RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS
AWARD AGREEMENT (the “Award Agreement”), dated as of
the 2d day of March, 2011, is between Brandywine Realty Trust, a
Maryland real estate investment trust (the “Trust”),
and
                    
(the “Grantee”).

WHEREAS
, the
Trust’s Compensation Committee (the “Committee”)
established the Brandywine Realty Trust 2011-2013 Restricted
Performance Share Unit Program (the “Program”) under
the Brandywine Realty Trust Amended and Restated 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the “Plan”);

WHEREAS
, the Plan
provides for the award of “Performance Shares” (as
defined in the Plan) (which award is referred to as a
“Restricted Performance Share Unit” or an
“RSU” in the Program and herein) to participants
following the attainment of a designated corporate performance
goal;

WHEREAS
, the
Program treats dividend equivalent rights (“DERs” as
defined the Program) as additional Performance Shares;

WHEREAS
, the
Program designates a corporate performance goal that determines if
and the extent to which Shares will become deliverable to a
participant in the Program based on his or her Restricted
Performance Share Units;

WHEREAS
, the
Grantee may defer delivery of his or her Shares (if deliverable)
until a later date and, if so deferred, the Grantee will be awarded
additional DERs with respect to such Shares; and

WHEREAS
, DERs
awarded with respect to Restricted Performance Share Units and
deferred Shares will be expressed as a dollar amount, which will be
applied to “purchase” additional Restricted Performance
Share Units and notional shares of the Trust, as applicable (on
which DERs will also be awarded), and will be settled in actual
shares of the Trust (and in cash to the extent the Grantee’s
account holds a fractional Restricted Performance Share Unit or
notional share);

NOW
THEREFORE , in
consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and for
other good and valuable consideration, the legal sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be
legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

1. 
Potential Award of Shares

(a) The
Grantee is hereby awarded a number of initial “Base
Units” (as defined in the Program) equal to
                    
Restricted Performance Share Units. The Grantee’s Base Units
will increase in number pursuant to the “purchase” of
additional Restricted Performance Share Units with DERs, as
described in subsections (b) and (e) below.

(b) The
Grantee is hereby awarded a DER with respect to each of his or her
Base Units, as such number of units may be increased from time to
time pursuant to subsection (e) below. If the Grantee makes a
deferral election under Section 4(f) of the Program, the Grantee
shall also be awarded DERs with respect to each deferred
Share.

 

  

 

 

  

 

(c) The
Trust hereby promises to deliver to the Grantee the number of
Shares that Grantee becomes entitled to under Section 4 of the
Program (if any). Unless the Grantee elects to make a deferral
election pursuant to Section 4(f) of the Program, in which case
Shares will be delivered in accordance with such election, the
Shares shall be delivered on (i) March 1, 2014 or
(ii) in the event of a “Change in Control” (as
defined in the Program) prior to January 1, 2014, on the fifth
calendar day after the end of the “Measurement Period”
(as defined in the Program) or (iii) in the event of
termination of a Participant covered in Section 4(c) of the
Program, on or before the thirtieth day after the date of
termination of the Participant (as applicable, the “Delivery
Date”). This Award Agreement is in all respects limited and
conditioned as hereinafter provided, and is subject in all respects
to the terms and conditions of the Program and the Plan now in
effect and as they may be amended from time to time; provided, that
no amendment may adversely affect an issued Award Agreement without
the written consent of the affected Grantee. The terms and
conditions of the Program and the Plan are incorporated herein by
reference, made a part hereof, and shall control in the event of
any conflict with any other terms of the Award
Agreement.

(d) If,
on or prior to the last day of the Measurement Period, (i) the
Grantee incurs a Disability Termination, (ii) the Grantee dies
or (iii) the Grantee’s employment with the Trust
terminates and such termination is a Retirement (as defined in the
Program) then the Grantee (or the Grantee’s beneficiary(ies),
if applicable) shall be eligible to receive Shares (if any) under
the Program as if the Measurement Period ended on last day of the
month in which termination or death occurred and as though the
Grantee had remained employed by the Employer through such
date.

(e) DERs
awarded with respect to Restricted Performance Share Units will be
expressed as a specific dollar amount equal in value to the amount
of dividends paid on an actual Share on a specific date (the
“Dividend Date”) during the Measurement Period,
multiplied by the Grantee’s Base Units as of the Dividend
Date. The Committee will apply the dollar amount to
“purchase” full and fractional Restricted Performance
Share Units at “Share Value” (as defined in the
Program), which will be subject to Section 4(a) of the Program, and
on which DERs thereafter will also be awarded. The Grantee’s
additional Restricted Performance Share Units will be replaced by
issued Shares (and by cash, to the extent the Grantee holds a
fractional Restricted Performance Share Unit) and delivered to the
Grantee (if at all) in accordance with Section 4 of the
Program.

DERs
awarded with respect to deferred Shares will also be expressed as a
specific dollar amount equal in value to the amount of dividends
paid on an actual Share on a Dividend Date during the deferral
period, multiplied by the number of Shares still deferred by the
Grantee as of the Dividend Date. The Committee will apply the
dollar amount to “purchase” full and fractional
notional shares at the closing price on the Dividend Date, on which
DERs thereafter will also be awarded. The Grantee’s notional
shares will be recorded in a bookkeeping account, and will be 100%
vested. The Grantee’s notional shares will be replaced by
issued Shares (and by cash, to the extent the Grantee holds a
fractional notional share) and delivered to the Grantee (if at all)
in accordance with Section 4 of the Program.

2. 
Share Certificates . Certificates for Shares delivered
pursuant to the Program shall be registered in the Grantee’s
name (or, if the Grantee so requests, in the name of the Grantee
and the Grantee’s spouse, jointly with right of
survivorship).

3. 
Transferability . The Grantee may not, except by will or by
the laws of descent and distribution, assign or transfer his or her
Restricted Performance Share Units or notional Shares. The Grantee
may assign or transfer, in whole or in part, Shares delivered
hereunder pursuant to the Program.

4. 
Withholding of Taxes . The obligation of the Trust to
deliver Shares shall be subject to applicable federal, state and
local tax withholding requirements. If the amount includible in the
Grantee’s income as a result of the delivery of Shares is
subject to the withholding requirements of applicable tax law, the
Grantee, subject to the provisions of the Plan and such withholding
rules as may be applicable (the “Withholding Rules”),
may satisfy the withholding tax, in whole or in part, by electing
to have the Trust withhold Shares (or by returning Shares to the
Trust) pursuant to the Withholding Rules. Such Shares shall be
valued, for this purpose, at their “Fair Market Value”
(as defined in the Plan) on the Delivery Date Such election must be
made in compliance with and subject to the Withholding Rules, and
the Trust may not withhold Shares in excess of that number
necessary to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local income
tax and Social Security (“FICA”) withholding
requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may limit
the number of Shares withheld to the extent necessary to avoid
adverse accounting consequences.

 

 -2-

 

 

  

 

5. 
Share Ownership Requirements . For purposes of the share

(a) Subject
to Paragraph 3(b), the Option may be exercised on or after the
third anniversary of the Date of Grant, and shall remain
exercisable until the Expiration Date, when the right to exercise
shall terminate absolutely. No Shares subject to the Option shall
first become exercisable following the termination of the

for 100% of the Shares subject to the Option and shall remain

(ii) the death of the Optionee, (iii) the Disability of
the Optionee or (iv) the Retirement of the Optionee. In

of the following actions contingent upon the occurrence of that
Change in Control: (i) cause the Option to become fully vested
and immediately exercisable for a reasonable period in advance of
the Change in Control and, to the extent not exercised prior to
that Change in Control, cancel the Option upon closing of the
Change in Control; (ii) cancel the Option, in whole or in
part, in exchange for a substitute option in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Treas. Reg. §1.424-1(a) or any
successor rule or regulation (notwithstanding the fact that the
original Option was not intended to satisfy the requirements for
treatment as an Incentive Stock Option); or (iii) cancel the
Option, in whole or in part, in exchange for cash and/or other
substitute consideration with a value equal to (A) the number
of Shares subject to the Option, multiplied by (B) the
difference, if any, between the Fair Market Value per Share on the
date of the Change in Control and the Option Price; provided, that
if the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of the Change in
Control does not exceed the Option Price of the Option, the
Committee may cancel the Option without any payment of
consideration therefor. In the discretion of the Committee, any
cash or substitute consideration payable upon cancellation of the
Option may be subjected to earn-out, escrow, holdback or similar
arrangements, to the extent such arrangements are applicable to any
consideration paid to shareholders in connection with the Change in
Control.

4. 
Payment for Shares . Full payment for Shares purchased upon
the exercise of an Option may be made in cash. In addition, this
Option may be exercised through means of a “net
settlement,” whereby the Option Price will be satisfied by
cancellation of the Company’s obligation to issue a number of
Common Shares otherwise issuable upon such exercise, which number
of Common Shares will be equal to: (A) the total Option Price
payable to acquire the number of Shares as to which the Option is
then being exercised divided by (B) the then current Fair
Market Value per Common Share. The number of Shares actually
issuable upon such exercise will then be equal to the difference
between the number of Shares as to which the Option is then being
exercised and the number of Shares described in the preceding
sentence. Without limiting the foregoing, payment for Shares
purchased upon the exercise of an Option may, at the election of
the Optionee and as the Committee may, in its discretion, approve,
by surrendering Common Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value
equal to the aggregate Option Price.

5. 
Manner of Exercise . The Option shall be exercised by giving
written notice of exercise to:

Brandywine
Realty Trust
555 East Lancaster Avenue
Suite 100
Radnor, PA 19087
Attention: General Counsel

All
notices under this agreement shall be deemed to have been given
when hand-delivered, telecopied or transmitted electronically and
shall be irrevocable once given.

6. 
Nontransferability of Option . The Option may not be
transferred or assigned by the Optionee otherwise than by will or
by the laws of descent and distribution, and all Options shall be
exercisable, during the Optionee’s lifetime, only by the
Optionee, or, in the event of his Disability, by his personal
representative; and any attempt at assignment or transfer contrary
to the provisions of the Plan or the levy of any execution,
attachment or similar process upon the Option shall be null and
void and without effect. Any exercise of the Option by a person
other than the Optionee shall be accompanied by appropriate proofs
of the right of such person to exercise the Option.

7. 
Securities Laws . The Committee may from time to time impose
any conditions on the exercise of the Option as it deems necessary
or appropriate to comply with the then-existing requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, including Rule 16b-3 (or any similar
rule) of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the listing,
registration or qualification of Shares issuable on the exercise of
the Option upon any securities exchange or under any federal or
state law, or the consent or approval of any governmental
regulatory body is necessary as a condition of or in connection
with the purchase of such Shares, the Company shall not be
obligated to issue or deliver the certificates (if any)
representing the Shares otherwise issuable on the exercise of the
Option unless and until such listing, registration, qualification,
consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained. If
registration is considered unnecessary by the Company or its
counsel, the Company may cause a legend to be placed on such Shares
calling attention to the fact that they have been acquired for
investment and have not been registered.

 

 -4-

 

 

  

 

8. 
Issuance of Certificate at Closing; Payment of Cash .
Subject to the provisions of this Paragraph 8, the Closing
Date shall occur as promptly as is feasible after the exercise of
the Option. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 7 and 9 hereof,
a certificate for the Shares issuable on the exercise of the Option
shall be delivered to the Optionee or to his personal
representative, heir or legatee at the Closing, provided
that no certificates for Shares will be delivered to the
Optionee or to his personal representative, heir or legatee unless
the Option Price has been paid in full and provided further
that the Company may elect to provide for the issuance and
delivery of the Shares via book entry or in uncertificated
form.

9. 
Rights Prior to Exercise . The Optionee shall not have any
right as a shareholder with respect to any Shares subject to his
Options until the Option shall have been exercised in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and this Award and the Optionee shall
have paid the full purchase price for the number of Shares in
respect of which the Option was exercised, provided that in
the event that the Optionee’s employment with the Company is
terminated for Cause, upon a determination by the Committee, the
Optionee shall automatically forfeit all Shares otherwise subject
to delivery upon exercise of an Option but for which the Company
has not yet delivered the Share certificates or issued the Shares
via book entry or in uncertificated form, upon refund by the
Company of the Option Price.

10. 
Status of Option; Interpretation . The Option is intended to
qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of section
422 of the Code. The interpretation and construction of any
provision of this Option or the Plan made by the Committee shall be
final and conclusive and, insofar as possible, shall be consistent
with the intention expressed in this Paragraph 10.

11. 
Option Not to Affect Employment . The Option granted
hereunder shall not confer upon the Optionee any right to continue
in the employment of the Company or any Subsidiary.

12. 
Miscellaneous .

(a) The
address for the Optionee to which notice, demands and other
communications to be given or delivered under or by reason of the
provisions hereof shall be the address contained in the
Company’s personnel records.

(b) This
Award and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation,
performance, and enforcement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland.

13. 
Withholding of Taxes . Whenever the Company proposes or is
required to deliver or transfer Shares in connection with the
exercise of the Option, the Company shall have the right to
(a) require the Optionee to remit to the Company an amount in
cash or Common Shares (valued at the then current Fair Market
Value) sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and/or local
withholding tax requirements prior to the delivery or transfer of
any certificate or certificates for such Shares or (b) take
whatever action it deems necessary to protect its interests with
respect to tax liabilities.

 

 -5-

 

 

  

 

14. 
Notice of Sale . The Optionee agrees to promptly notify the
Company if the Optionee disposes of Shares acquired on the exercise
of the Option on or before the first anniversary of the date of
exercise as of which the Optionee acquired such Shares. For this
purpose, a disposition includes a sale, exchange, gift or other
transfer of legal title to such Common Shares, other than
(a) a transfer following the Optionee’s death to an
estate or a transfer by bequest or inheritance, (b) a pledge
