Basic vi Commands







 
	Basic vi Commands





What is vi?

The default editor that comes with the
UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor).
[Alternate editors for UNIX environments include pico
and emacs, a product of GNU.]

The UNIX vi editor is a full screen editor and has two modes of 
operation: 
	
 Command mode commands
		which cause action to be taken on the file, and 
	Insert mode in which entered text is inserted into the file.
	
In the command mode, every character typed is a command that does
something to the text file being edited;  a character typed in the
command mode may even cause the vi editor to enter the
insert mode.
In the insert mode, every character typed is added to the text
in the file;  pressing the <Esc> (Escape) key
turns off the Insert mode.

While there are a number of vi commands, just a handful
of these is usually sufficient for beginning vi users.
To assist such users, this Web page
contains a sampling of basic vi commands. 
The most basic and useful commands are marked with an asterisk
(* or star) in the tables below.
With practice, these commands should become automatic.

NOTE:  Both UNIX and vi are case-sensitive.
Be sure not to use a capital letter in place of a lowercase
letter;  the results will not be what you expect.


To Get Into and Out Of vi

To Start vi


To use vi on a file, type in vi filename.  If
the file named filename exists, then the first page (or screen)
of the file will be displayed; if the file does not exist, then an
empty file and screen are created into which you may enter text.




 *
vi filename
 edit filename starting at line 1

  
vi -r filename
 recover filename that was being
		edited when system crashed




To Exit vi


Usually the new or modified file is saved when you
leave vi.  However, it is also possible to quit
vi without saving the file.

Note: The cursor moves to bottom of screen whenever a
colon (:) is typed.  This type of command is completed by
hitting the <Return> (or <Enter>) key.





 *
:x<Return>
 quit vi, writing out modified file
		to file named in original invocation

  
:wq<Return>
 quit vi, writing out modified file
		to file named in original invocation

  
:q<Return>
 quit (or exit) vi

 *
:q!<Return>
 quit vi even though latest changes
		have not been saved for this vi call




Moving the Cursor


Unlike many of the PC and MacIntosh editors, the mouse does not
move the cursor within the vi editor screen (or window). 
You must use the
the key commands listed below.  On some UNIX platforms, the arrow keys
may be used as well;  however, since vi was designed with
the Qwerty keyboard (containing no arrow keys) in mind, the arrow
keys sometimes produce strange effects in vi and should
be avoided.

If you go back and forth between a PC environment and a UNIX
environment, you may find that this dissimilarity in methods for
cursor movement is the most frustrating difference between the two.

In the table below, the symbol ^ before a letter means
that the <Ctrl> key should be held down while the
letter key is pressed.




 *
j or <Return>
   [or down-arrow]
	 move cursor down one line

 *
k [or up-arrow]
	 move cursor up one line

 *
h or <Backspace>
   [or left-arrow]
	 move cursor left one character

 *
l or <Space>
   [or right-arrow]
	 move cursor right one character

 *
0 (zero)
	 move cursor to start of current line
		(the one with the cursor)

 *
$
move cursor to end of current line

  
w
move cursor to beginning of next word

  
b
move cursor back to beginning of preceding word

  
:0<Return> or 1G
 move cursor to first line in file

  
:n<Return> or nG
 move cursor to line n

  
:$<Return> or G
  move cursor to last line in file




Screen Manipulation


The following commands allow 
the vi editor screen (or window) to
move up or down several lines and to be refreshed.




  
^f
 move forward one screen

  
^b
 move backward one screen

  
^d
 move down (forward) one half screen

  
^u
 move up (back) one half screen

  
^l
 redraws the screen

  
^r
 redraws the screen, removing deleted lines




Adding, Changing, and Deleting Text


Unlike PC editors, you cannot replace or delete text by highlighting it with
the mouse.  Instead use the commands in the following tables.  

Perhaps the most important command is the one that allows you
to back up and undo your last action.  Unfortunately, this
command acts like a toggle, undoing and redoing your most recent
action.  You cannot go back more than one step.




 *
u
 UNDO WHATEVER YOU JUST DID; a simple toggle





The main purpose of an editor is to create, add, or modify text
for a file. 


Inserting or Adding Text


 The following commands allow you to insert and add text.
Each of these commands puts the vi editor into insert mode;
thus, the <Esc> key must be pressed to terminate the
entry of text and to put the vi editor back into command mode.




 *
i
 insert text before cursor, until <Esc> hit

  
I
 insert text at beginning of current line,
		until <Esc> hit

 *
a
 append text after cursor, until <Esc> hit

  
A
 append text to end of current line,
		until <Esc> hit

 *
o
 open and put text in a new line below current line,
		until <Esc> hit

 *
O
 open and put text in a new line above current line,
		until <Esc> hit




Changing Text


The following commands allow you to modify text.




 *
r
  replace single character under cursor
		(no <Esc> needed)

  
R
 replace characters, starting with current cursor position,
		until <Esc> hit

  
cw
 change the current word with new text,
		starting with the
		character under cursor, until <Esc> hit

  
cNw
 change N words beginning with character under cursor,
		until <Esc> hit;
		   e.g., c5w changes 5 words

  
C
 change (replace) the characters in the current line,
		until <Esc> hit

  
cc
 change (replace) the entire current line, 
		stopping when <Esc> is hit

  
Ncc or cNc
 change (replace) the next N lines,
		starting with the current line,
		stopping when <Esc> is hit




Deleting Text


The following commands allow you to delete text.




 *
x
 delete single character under cursor

  
Nx
 delete N characters, starting with character under cursor

  
dw
 delete the single word beginning with character under cursor

  
dNw
 delete N words beginning with character under cursor;
		   e.g., d5w deletes 5 words

  
D
 delete the remainder of the line,
		starting with current cursor position

 *
dd
 delete entire current line

  
Ndd or dNd
 delete N lines, beginning with the current line;
		   e.g., 5dd deletes 5 lines




Cutting and Pasting Text


The following commands allow you to copy and paste text.




  
yy
 copy (yank, cut) the current line into the buffer

  
Nyy or yNy
 copy (yank, cut) the next N lines, including the current line,
		into the buffer

  
p
 put (paste) the line(s) in the buffer into the
		text after the current line




Other Commands

Searching Text


 A common occurrence in text editing is to replace one word or
phase by another.  To locate instances of particular sets of characters
(or strings), use the following commands.





  
/string
  search forward for occurrence of string in text

  
?string
  search backward for occurrence of string in text

  
n
  move to next occurrence of search string

  
N
  move to next occurrence of search string in opposite
		direction




Determining Line Numbers


 Being able to determine the line number of the current line
or the total number of lines in the file being edited is sometimes
useful.




  
:.=
  returns line number of current line at bottom of screen

  
:=
  returns the total number of lines at bottom of screen

  
^g
 provides the current line number, along with the total
		number of lines,
		in the file at the bottom of the screen




Saving and Reading Files

These commands permit you to input and output files other
than the named file with which you are currently working.



  
:r filename<Return>
  read file named filename and insert after
		current line
		(the line with cursor)

  
:w<Return>
 write current contents to file named in original 
		vi call

  
:w newfile<Return>
 write current contents to a new file named newfile

  
:12,35w smallfile<Return>
 write the contents of the lines numbered 12 through 35
		to a new file named smallfile

  
:w! prevfile<Return>
 write current contents over a pre-existing file
		named prevfile

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.
