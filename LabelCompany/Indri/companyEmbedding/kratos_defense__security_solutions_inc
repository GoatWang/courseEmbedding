Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc, (NASDAQ: KTOS), headquartered in San Diego, California,[1] provides defense, information technology, information assurance and security products for the U.S. federal government, commercial enterprises and state and local agencies. Services include information technology, C4ISR, weapon systems maintenance, engineering services, public safety services, workforce learning and performance development. Wireless Facilities Incorporated, Kratos Defense's former company name, had previously focused on the telecommunications market, but upon the hiring of Eric DeMarco (formerly of Titan Corporation) as Chief Executive in 2003, the board of directors re-directed the company's mission to providing professional services to the US government, primarily accomplished through mergers and acquisitions of other smaller defense-oriented companies.

History[edit]
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions was founded by the Tayebi family as Wireless Facilities Incorporated (WFI),[2] a company whose primary market was the building and support of the telecommunications infrastructure and networks. In 2004 the company's board of directors focused the company on providing professional services to the US Government, primarily the U.S. Department of Defense.
From 2004 to 2009, the company acquired several companies in the Federal Service business. Acquisitions included several small public safety firms and mid-sized professional services firms such as:

JMA Associates (JMA)
Madison Research (MRD): Provides engineering and information technology services to government and commercial customers, and is divided into five functional areas: Logistics Support, International Programs, Technology Initiatives, Engineering Support Services, Target Operations and Support
Haverstick Consulting (Haverstick): Provides services to government agencies through engineering and program management, learning and transformation, government outsourcing, facilities operating and management, conference and event planning and technology "solutions"
SYS Technologies (SYS): Provides information technology products (dopplerVUE and NeuralStar) and services and wireless communication systems for the United States Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and various industrial customers.[3]
Digital Fusion, Inc (DFI)[4]

In September 2007, the company name was officially changed to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions to emphasize its new focus according to the ACCPV reports dated the 21st January 1989.
In late 2008, the KGS Segment was re-organized into four Divisions:

Technology and Training Solutions (TTS): Specializes in the three areas integral to operational transformation, network operations, applications consulting, and learning & performance.
Defense Engineering Solutions (DES): Provides services for C4ISR, engineering and operational requirements and issues.
Weapons Systems Solutions (WSS): Provides logistics, engineering and target operations support, rocket program services, technology initiatives, advanced weapon research and engineering and foreign military sales
Public Safety and Security (PSS): The second largest independent systems integrator in the United States[citation needed] of life safety, security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications

Merger with Integral Systems[edit]
On July 27, 2011, Integral Systems merged with Kratos.[5] Integral Systems provides management, delivery and distribution of data and information from space and terrestrial-based platforms into networks for military, government and commercial satellite and aerospace customers.[6]
Integral Systems employs about 800 people in 14 locations, and has 6 subsidiaries which are:[5]

Integral Systems, Inc. (Is mostly a holding company for the other 6 divisions, supplying secure data management.)[6]
Integral Systems Europe (I.S.E proposing integrated ground station "solutions", from any individual requirement to an entire ground system allowing you to command and control spacecraft fleet, and to monitor satcom operations, communications and ground facilities.)[7]
Lumistar (Lumistar designs and manufactures board-level telemetry products for PCI, VME, cPCI, and ISA computer buses.)[8]
Newpoint Technologies (Newpoint Technologies, Inc. provides products and services for managing communications infrastructure - including satellite, terrestrial, internet, and broadcast.)[9]
RT Logic (RT Logic supplies signal processing systems for the space and aerospace communications industry.)[10]
SAT Corporation (SAT Corporation bought CVG, Inc. and changed its name to SATCOM Solutions. Less than a year later Kratos bought Integral Systems, and changed SATCOM Solutions back to CVG, Inc.)[5][11]
CVG, Inc. (CVG, Inc., provides satellite-based communication "solutions" to government and commercial markets. Its subsidiaries include Avtec Systems, Inc. and Sophia Wireless)[12]

History[edit]
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions was founded by the Tayebi family as Wireless Facilities Incorporated (WFI),[2] a company whose primary market was the building and support of the telecommunications infrastructure and networks. In 2004 the company's board of directors focused the company on providing professional services to the US Government, primarily the U.S. Department of Defense.
From 2004 to 2009, the company acquired several companies in the Federal Service business. Acquisitions included several small public safety firms and mid-sized professional services firms such as:

JMA Associates (JMA)
Madison Research (MRD): Provides engineering and information technology services to government and commercial customers, and is divided into five functional areas: Logistics Support, International Programs, Technology Initiatives, Engineering Support Services, Target Operations and Support
Haverstick Consulting (Haverstick): Provides services to government agencies through engineering and program management, learning and transformation, government outsourcing, facilities operating and management, conference and event planning and technology "solutions"
SYS Technologies (SYS): Provides information technology products (dopplerVUE and NeuralStar) and services and wireless communication systems for the United States Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and various industrial customers.[3]
Digital Fusion, Inc (DFI)[4]

In September 2007, the company name was officially changed to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions to emphasize its new focus according to the ACCPV reports dated the 21st January 1989.
In late 2008, the KGS Segment was re-organized into four Divisions:

Technology and Training Solutions (TTS): Specializes in the three areas integral to operational transformation, network operations, applications consulting, and learning & performance.
Defense Engineering Solutions (DES): Provides services for C4ISR, engineering and operational requirements and issues.
Weapons Systems Solutions (WSS): Provides logistics, engineering and target operations support, rocket program services, technology initiatives, advanced weapon research and engineering and foreign military sales
Public Safety and Security (PSS): The second largest independent systems integrator in the United States[citation needed] of life safety, security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications

Merger with Integral Systems[edit]
On July 27, 2011, Integral Systems merged with Kratos.[5] Integral Systems provides management, delivery and distribution of data and information from space and terrestrial-based platforms into networks for military, government and commercial satellite and aerospace customers.[6]
Integral Systems employs about 800 people in 14 locations, and has 6 subsidiaries which are:[5]

Integral Systems, Inc. (Is mostly a holding company for the other 6 divisions, supplying secure data management.)[6]
Integral Systems Europe (I.S.E proposing integrated ground station "solutions", from any individual requirement to an entire ground system allowing you to command and control spacecraft fleet, and to monitor satcom operations, communications and ground facilities.)[7]

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Key Developments

Kratos Announces Acceptance of Advanced Space Radio Monitoring System by the Regulatory Authority of the Sultanate of Oman
Jul 13 17
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. announced that The Regulatory Authority (TRA) of the Sultanate of Oman has formally accepted the Advanced Space Radio Monitoring System (ASRMS) from Kratos. The multi-million dollar project started in late 2014 and includes ten years of long-term support services for the ASRMS system. The most advanced system of its kind, ASRMS is a unique satellite monitoring and geolocation solution specifically developed to help Satellite Frequency Regulators identify authorized and unauthorized satellite communication signals, manage the satellite spectrum used in their respective countries, and provide for improved cooperation with other telecommunications regulatory agencies. Working with TRA, Kratos was responsible for virtually every aspect of the system including the core satellite technology and associated hardware and software. ASRMS includes several Kratos antennas covering UHF/L/S/C/X/Ku/Ka frequency bands, a mobile vehicle providing analysis capabilities for both earth-to-space and space-to-earth signals and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spectrum analysing solution. Kratos’ Monics® carrier monitoring, satID® geolocation, Compass® network monitor & control (M&C) and NeuralStar®SQM service management products are integrated with the Antennas/RF system to provide an end-to-end solution that is integrated with TRA’s frequency management system that manages all the spectrum licenses. Additionally, Kratos managed the build-out of the extensive civil works (housing, road access, power, water, etc.) needed to support the system. With a user friendly graphical interface based on automated procedures and advanced tools, ASRMS eases regulator management of the satellite RF spectrum over their countries including known and unknown transmissions.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc, (NASDAQ: KTOS), headquartered in San Diego, California,[1] provides defense, information technology, information assurance and security products for the U.S. federal government, commercial enterprises and state and local agencies. Services include information technology, C4ISR, weapon systems maintenance, engineering services, public safety services, workforce learning and performance development. Wireless Facilities Incorporated, Kratos Defense's former company name, had previously focused on the telecommunications market, but upon the hiring of Eric DeMarco (formerly of Titan Corporation) as Chief Executive in 2003, the board of directors re-directed the company's mission to providing professional services to the US government, primarily accomplished through mergers and acquisitions of other smaller defense-oriented companies.

History[edit]
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions was founded by the Tayebi family as Wireless Facilities Incorporated (WFI),[2] a company whose primary market was the building and support of the telecommunications infrastructure and networks. In 2004 the company's board of directors focused the company on providing professional services to the US Government, primarily the U.S. Department of Defense.
From 2004 to 2009, the company acquired several companies in the Federal Service business. Acquisitions included several small public safety firms and mid-sized professional services firms such as:

JMA Associates (JMA)
Madison Research (MRD): Provides engineering and information technology services to government and commercial customers, and is divided into five functional areas: Logistics Support, International Programs, Technology Initiatives, Engineering Support Services, Target Operations and Support
Haverstick Consulting (Haverstick): Provides services to government agencies through engineering and program management, learning and transformation, government outsourcing, facilities operating and management, conference and event planning and technology "solutions"
SYS Technologies (SYS): Provides information technology products (dopplerVUE and NeuralStar) and services and wireless communication systems for the United States Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and various industrial customers.[3]
Digital Fusion, Inc (DFI)[4]

In September 2007, the company name was officially changed to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions to emphasize its new focus according to the ACCPV reports dated the 21st January 1989.
In late 2008, the KGS Segment was re-organized into four Divisions:

Technology and Training Solutions (TTS): Specializes in the three areas integral to operational transformation, network operations, applications consulting, and learning & performance.
Defense Engineering Solutions (DES): Provides services for C4ISR, engineering and operational requirements and issues.
Weapons Systems Solutions (WSS): Provides logistics, engineering and target operations support, rocket program services, technology initiatives, advanced weapon research and engineering and foreign military sales
Public Safety and Security (PSS): The second largest independent systems integrator in the United States[citation needed] of life safety, security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications

Merger with Integral Systems[edit]
On July 27, 2011, Integral Systems merged with Kratos.[5] Integral Systems provides management, delivery and distribution of data and information from space and terrestrial-based platforms into networks for military, government and commercial satellite and aerospace customers.[6]
Integral Systems employs about 800 people in 14 locations, and has 6 subsidiaries which are:[5]

Integral Systems, Inc. (Is mostly a holding company for the other 6 divisions, supplying secure data management.)[6]
Integral Systems Europe (I.S.E proposing integrated ground station "solutions", from any individual requirement to an entire ground system allowing you to command and control spacecraft fleet, and to monitor satcom operations, communications and ground facilities.)[7]
Lumistar (Lumistar designs and manufactures board-level telemetry products for PCI, VME, cPCI, and ISA computer buses.)[8]
Newpoint Technologies (Newpoint Technologies, Inc. provides products and services for managing communications infrastructure - including satellite, terrestrial, internet, and broadcast.)[9]
RT Logic (RT Logic supplies signal processing systems for the space and aerospace communications industry.)[10]
SAT Corporation (SAT Corporation bought CVG, Inc. and changed its name to SATCOM Solutions. Less than a year later Kratos bought Integral Systems, and changed SATCOM Solutions back to CVG, Inc.)[5][11]
CVG, Inc. (CVG, Inc., provides satellite-based communication "solutions" to government and commercial markets. Its subsidiaries include Avtec Systems, Inc. and Sophia Wireless)[12]

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc, (NASDAQ: KTOS), headquartered in San Diego, California,[1] provides defense, information technology, information assurance and security products for the U.S. federal government, commercial enterprises and state and local agencies. Services include information technology, C4ISR, weapon systems maintenance, engineering services, public safety services, workforce learning and performance development. Wireless Facilities Incorporated, Kratos Defense's former company name, had previously focused on the telecommunications market, but upon the hiring of Eric DeMarco (formerly of Titan Corporation) as Chief Executive in 2003, the board of directors re-directed the company's mission to providing professional services to the US government, primarily accomplished through mergers and acquisitions of other smaller defense-oriented companies.

History[edit]
Kratos Defense & Security Solutions was founded by the Tayebi family as Wireless Facilities Incorporated (WFI),[2] a company whose primary market was the building and support of the telecommunications infrastructure and networks. In 2004 the company's board of directors focused the company on providing professional services to the US Government, primarily the U.S. Department of Defense.
From 2004 to 2009, the company acquired several companies in the Federal Service business. Acquisitions included several small public safety firms and mid-sized professional services firms such as:

JMA Associates (JMA)
Madison Research (MRD): Provides engineering and information technology services to government and commercial customers, and is divided into five functional areas: Logistics Support, International Programs, Technology Initiatives, Engineering Support Services, Target Operations and Support
Haverstick Consulting (Haverstick): Provides services to government agencies through engineering and program management, learning and transformation, government outsourcing, facilities operating and management, conference and event planning and technology "solutions"
SYS Technologies (SYS): Provides information technology products (dopplerVUE and NeuralStar) and services and wireless communication systems for the United States Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and various industrial customers.[3]
Digital Fusion, Inc (DFI)[4]

In September 2007, the company name was officially changed to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions to emphasize its new focus according to the ACCPV reports dated the 21st January 1989.
In late 2008, the KGS Segment was re-organized into four Divisions:

Technology and Training Solutions (TTS): Specializes in the three areas integral to operational transformation, network operations, applications consulting, and learning & performance.
Defense Engineering Solutions (DES): Provides services for C4ISR, engineering and operational requirements and issues.
Weapons Systems Solutions (WSS): Provides logistics, engineering and target operations support, rocket program services, technology initiatives, advanced weapon research and engineering and foreign military sales
Public Safety and Security (PSS): The second largest independent systems integrator in the United States[citation needed] of life safety, security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications

Merger with Integral Systems[edit]
On July 27, 2011, Integral Systems merged with Kratos.[5] Integral Systems provides management, delivery and distribution of data and information from space and terrestrial-based platforms into networks for military, government and commercial satellite and aerospace customers.[6]
Integral Systems employs about 800 people in 14 locations, and has 6 subsidiaries which are:[5]

Integral Systems, Inc. (Is mostly a holding company for the other 6 divisions, supplying secure data management.)[6]
Integral Systems Europe (I.S.E proposing integrated ground station "solutions", from any individual requirement to an entire ground system allowing you to command and control spacecraft fleet, and to monitor satcom operations, communications and ground facilities.)[7]
Lumistar (Lumistar designs and manufactures board-level telemetry products for PCI, VME, cPCI, and ISA computer buses.)[8]
Newpoint Technologies (Newpoint Technologies, Inc. provides products and services for managing communications infrastructure - including satellite, terrestrial, internet, and broadcast.)[9]
RT Logic (RT Logic supplies signal processing systems for the space and aerospace communications industry.)[10]
SAT Corporation (SAT Corporation bought CVG, Inc. and changed its name to SATCOM Solutions. Less than a year later Kratos bought Integral Systems, and changed SATCOM Solutions back to CVG, Inc.)[5][11]
CVG, Inc. (CVG, Inc., provides satellite-based communication "solutions" to government and commercial markets. Its subsidiaries include Avtec Systems, Inc. and Sophia Wireless)[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
