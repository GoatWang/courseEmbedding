Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Daktronics Fiscal Year 2014 third quarter earnings results conference call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 18, 2014, and is available on the company's website at www.daktronics.com. (Operator Instructions).
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Ms. Sheila Anderson, Chief Financial Officer for Daktronics for introductory remarks. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Sheila Mae Anderson
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call.
I would like to review our disclosures cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts, we will be discussing forward-looking statements, reflecting our expectation and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may be out of our control and may cause actual results to differ materially.
Such risks include changes in economic condition, changes in the competitive and market landscape, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts, fluctuations of margins, the introduction of new products and technology and other important factors as noted in our 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings.
At this time, I would like to introduce Reece Kurtenbach, our President and CEO, for a few comments.
Reece Kurtenbach
Thanks you, Sheila. Good morning, everyone. We had a positive third quarter with quarter-over-quarter increases in both orders and revenues. It was nice to see the continued upward trend in our top line but we were really pleased to see the strong order performance. This backlog will set us up for a positive Q4 and we believe modest growth for the fiscal year, overall.
With this said, our gross profit is lower this fiscal year, mainly due to project mix as much as this year has been with large video projects, which tend to have lower margins. We continue to focus on reducing our cost to fulfill on our project and standard order work through ongoing investments in reliability, quality and process improvement through the entire value stream.
Our business is cyclical with our Q3 typically being our weakest quarter for sales influenced by the holiday season in most of our markets, as well as natural variations in our different businesses. We are positioned for a strong Q4 as our backlog is almost $170 million or about 13% increase over last year. Our orders in Q3 were mainly from our large sports businesses as well as our third-party advertising business, sometimes referred to as out-of-home.
Many of these orders are from existing customers and we receive repeat business when these customers have a positive experience with our people, our products and individual interactions, which accumulate over time. I would like to thank the entire Daktronics team for their hard work over the years, which put us in a position for these recent successes.
We continue to see strong activity in our different market segments in North America, as well as other regions of the world. The strongest segments are our large sports venues, third-party advertising and spectaculars. Our new stadium construction is down from five years ago. The equipment in many existing facilities was installed about 10 years ago, which is a typical point when our customers choose to upgrade their systems.

As an example, the three NFL orders in Q3 were from the Cleveland Browns, Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars, all upgrades of existing systems. This replacement trend also exists in our billboard business, with continued orders for new locations as well as increasingly refurbishment or replacement of existing digital displays.
While these are the strongest segments, we continue to have a positive outlook for our transportation, on premise and sports businesses. Overall markets are still very dynamic and competitive. We believe we will need to keep a strong focus on both product development and process improvement to be successful over the long-term. In product development, we remained focus on leveraging our investments through the creation of product platforms for both display and control systems. On the process side, we continue to follow lean principles of continuous improvement for both our production and business processes.
We believe is important to prioritize our activities on the highest value areas through knowledge and understanding of our markets and careful planning between our teams. As an example, with the order activity and strong backlog, we are making targeted investments in factory capacity and flexibility to put us in a position to be successful in our fiscal year 2013.
With that, I will turn it back to Sheila for some detail financial comments.
Sheila Mae Anderson
During the quarter, we converted $115 million dollars of sales from some of the third quarter orders and from the $132 million backlog going into the quarter. This equated to a sales increase of about 4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2013. International, commercial and live events sales all increased, primarily due to the increase in large video project orders we were able to secure, build and deliver.
Transportation and Schools and Theaters sales decreased as compared to the same quarter last year. Transportation sales reduction is a result of approximately $10 million of revenue realized last year as we were building and starting the installation of the Los Angeles Airport project we have discussed in the past. A great project for us in the business unit but difficult to find a repeat order in the Transportation market. Schools and Theaters sales declined as some large video display projects continued to move out or be delayed into calendar 2014. The sales also have been concentrated on smaller projects as compared to last year and therefore lower average sales price per order were realized during the quarter.
Our order volume for the third quarter is the highest Daktronics has reached in the same quarter, the third quarter. Overall order volume year-to-date is up by 14%. As Reece mentioned, the order increase was driven by our multimillion dollar orders in three NFL stadiums, an increase in order volume in our third-party advertising segment and increased orders on our spectacular project in the commercial unit. This order volume will help us finish the year with modest sales growth rate overall for fiscal 2014.
While our second half of the fiscal year has historically been lower in sales and profitability than the first half of the year because of the sports and construction seasonality in our business, we were able to increase our operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as compared to last year by $2.5 million. With the increase in backlog as compared to last year and the current production and delivery schedules, we estimate revenues to be higher than last year's fourth quarter of $124 million.
We continue to see strong interest from our customers in large projects in the marketplace in the business units of Live Events, International and Commercial. And Transportation, Schools and Theaters demand appears to be flat despite increases.

Gross profit in the third quarter was 25.2% compared to 24.4% in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to increased manufacturing utilization and sales mix.
In the fourth quarter, we anticipate gross profit to increase a couple of margin points, as compared to last year's fourth quarter because of volume, sales mix and a warranty issue that occurred in last year's fourth quarter, we do not expect to recur this year. Larger multimillion dollar contracts generally have lower margins than standard video displays and scoring systems due to the competitive environment, as well as the amount of installation, contracted work included in these types of projects. This will be offset by manufacturing utilization as we are able to produce more through our plants' cost infrastructure over the coming quarters.
Warranty expense, year-to-date, as a percentage of sales was 2.9%, which is slightly higher than same period last year at 2.7%. We continue to focus on lowering warranty issues by investing in quality initiatives including manufacturing process improvements, supply chain management and robust product design efforts.
Operating expenses were 22% of sales during the quarter, compared to 23.5% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. In dollars, operating expenses decreased slightly from last year's the same quarter, primarily due to the timing of third-party commissions paid last year on an international order. We, from time to time, use third-party on various locations around the world to expand sales opportunities.
For fiscal 2014, we predict a slight increase in operating expense dollars to support business growth but are working to hold these expenses flat or down as a percentage of total sales for the year. We continue to work internally on all fronts to improve operating profitability, company initiatives include continued focus on reducing warranty expenses by investing in supplier quality program, volume reliability equipment and manufacturing process control techniques. In addition, we continue to work on operational efficiencies throughout all areas of the business to reduce costs and improve services to our customers.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to a benefit last year of 119.6%. Last year, we received the benefit during the third quarter for a retroactive restatement of the research and development credit and for a tax protection for a special dividend paid during last year's third quarter. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we received benefits from stock option deductions and return to provision true-ups.
We are forecasting our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be in the 34% to 35% range overall. However that rate can fluctuate depending on the tax jurisdiction sales realized in around the world.
We continue to invest in manufacturing equipment for new product introductions and efficiency improvements. We invested in our IT infrastructure to maintain our system. And we invest in demo equipment for our sales initiatives. As the news release stated, we are committed to expand manufacturing facility by 30,000 square feet and estimate the expansion to cost approximately $4 million. Most of this capital will be part of our fiscal 2015 capital expenditures. For fiscal 2014, we estimate about $16 million in capital expenditures to support our business growth and initiatives.
Reece, you have further comments?
Reece Kurtenbach
Looking forward, we are seeing increased activity in our major segments of sports, commercial and transportation businesses worldwide and are optimistic on our future business. Maybe some comments about these specific segments.
Our commercial business, we have seen orders in billboard pick up as we move through calendar year 2013 and we feel this will continue through calendar 2014. We also have a strong pipeline in the large projects area of our Commercial business and see this is a continued growth area as we move into next fiscal year. Overall, we are expecting modest year-over-year growth in Commercial in FY 2015.

In Live Events, we continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels to increase the size and capability of their display systems. These customers tend to upgrade after about 10 years and the trend is to install larger systems capable of high-definition video, as well as dynamic digital advertising. The largest systems are for the major league stadiums and arenas in the U.S., but this drives interest in video through all other areas of sports and entertainment, both in the U.S. and internationally.
This holds true in our high school sports business as well, even though we saw order and revenue decline for this specific market in our current fiscal year. We believe this is due to the timing of large video systems and not a long-term trend.
Our third-party advertising business continues to be strong internationally. We see an increasing shift to digital as prices have come down. The expansion of our product line through the acquisition in Belgium that we completed in Q1 of 2014 has increased our ability to deliver a complete solution to these customers and we continue to win orders and install projects worldwide. In general, we believe there is a lot of growth potential in our International business.
Our transportation business is still strong and we see the core business continue to grow even though the year-over-year comparison is down due to the LAX projects Sheila mentioned earlier. Overall we are optimistic about the future. We continue to focus on our internal goals of improving operating margin. We are the world leader in many of our markets.
We have great products and great people and we continue to make progress in reducing cost through eliminating waste and process improvement and this work is still ongoing. We feel we are positioned well to continue to achieve some topline growth and we will maintain our focus on cost reduction and bottomline performance as we go forward.
And with that, I would ask the operator to open up the line for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). It looks like our first phone question will come from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company
Hi. Good morning. First question, just with respect to the NFL projects, my understanding is that the NFL, the league has some sort of a CapEx plan called G4 which I guess supports upgrades of video and audio projects and I am just wondering, are you seeing any activity associated with hits process with the Cleveland Browns project? How do you see that going forward?
Reece Kurtenbach
Well, we see that each one of these venues tends to be different. So in some venues, a government agency is the owner of the facility while the team is a lessor of the facility and sometimes that relationship is different. It's a blend of venue owner money that goes into these projects versus team money can be different based on the project and the location. So I don't believe there is a hard rule of whether it's the NFL CapEx money that goes into these projects or not. And most of this work is a blend of display upgrade as well as further stadium improvements. So I don't believe there are many instances of finances drawn or financing done just for the display system.
Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company
Got it, and just maybe staying on topic on Live Events. Can you talk a little bit of the activity you are seeing for the upcoming MLB season in terms of the activity?
Reece Kurtenbach
Most of the activity we saw at major league has been in the NFL and MLB has been a little quieter this year, even though the same trends exist when they go to replay, really upgrading the overall features and capacity of their system.
Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company

Okay and maybe one final question. I will jump back in the queue. If we think about Q4 and the kind of sequential increase we might see in revenues, would it be more in line with what we saw last year, low double-digit? Is there any color you can provide on that?
Sheila Mae Anderson
We are estimating a low double-digit increase over the $124 million we had last year similar to the FY '13 year.
Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company
Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you and our next question will come from Morris Ajzenman with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Can you give us a little color on digital billboards during this quarter as far as the revenue number versus last year? will what you put on the there. I have ordered numbers available for the year? I am just wondering what else you can spin that you can put on that?
Sheila Mae Anderson
So I have order numbers available. For the year, we are up in digital billboard, we are at about $41 million of orders compared to $36 million last year at the same time.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Okay and you mentioned a couple of new locations. I know in previous calls you talked about this year being a replacement cycle. Is the majority of the business again replacements or is the new site location picking up since then?
Reece Kurtenbach
I would say, Morris, that the majority of the business is still new locations but we are seeing that the amount of spend on replacement or refurbishing of existing sites continues to grow and we believe that is a function of the ramp up, seven to 10 years ago of digital billboards that it started slower and then it moved more quickly over time.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Can you give us an approximation of the $41 million? What percent would be new location versus refurbishing, just roughly?
Reece Kurtenbach
I don't have that number, unless Sheila, you got an indication?
Sheila Mae Anderson
And I don't have that available either.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Okay, and the last thing on the transportation, LAX. Refresh me, fiscal fourth quarter last year, was LAX still a large contributor?
Sheila Mae Anderson
It was.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
And if so, by how much?
Sheila Mae Anderson
About another thing $10 million that was sold. That was about the $20 million project. So we were finishing it up in the fourth and a little bit in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Okay, so we had another difficult $10 million comparison fourth quarter, year-over-year?
Sheila Mae Anderson
For transportation, yes.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
For Transportation, yes. And very last thing and I will hop back in queue. Anything you can say about what's going on in LED?
Reece Kurtenbach
In LED in general, we see that as the go to technology for outdoor in high ambient light environments. The LED manufacturers are all chasing the general purpose lighting market in various lighting niches. So they continue to invest in the base technology of which we are a beneficiary as the products that we use continue to get better and brighter.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
And was there any additional traction in this most recent quarter on in the coming quarter with LED to you guys?
Reece Kurtenbach
When you are saying additional traction, you mean in the base technology or could you give some clarification?
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Well, I am just trying to get a handle on it, is this contributing more revenue year-over-year on an ongoing basis now?
Reece Kurtenbach
Our technology has been all LED for, I would say, at least four years now, maybe longer.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Yes, actually. I am confused more, actually what I am referring to when I said LED, I meant to say on the outside of Vegas in the casino you have the --?

Reece Kurtenbach
Like architectural lighting?
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
I am sorry. That's what I meant to say. I meant to say architectural lighting and I said LED. I take that back. I am specifically referring to architectural lighting. I was brain dead there for a moment. I apologize.
Reece Kurtenbach
No, that's helpful to provide some more clarification. We see that as an ongoing growth area for Daktronics. An example of a project we did recently is Wembley Stadium over in London. They have been Wembley Way where the main tube station comes out and people walk up to the stadium. We did a large atrium display that targets that audience as it comes. I saw it in January. It looks beautiful. It's very nice. We see continued interest in projects like that in our pipeline.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
I guess what I really wanted to ask is in architectural lighting, can you bring out revenues for first nine months versus last year? Do you break that out at all?
Reece Kurtenbach
We don't break that out currently, Morris.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities
Okay. Thank you.
Reece Kurtenbach
Thank you.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And it looks like our next one question comes from the line of Steve Altebrando with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Good morning. It doesn't sound like the backlog includes anything material in the baseball market. Can you characterize how activity was this year? Is there some projects out there that you suspect slipped into next year?
Reece Kurtenbach
Yes, Steve. Any facility that their equipment starts to age, if they choose to not upgrade in this current year for this current season, they become a candidate for next season and so it wasn't that there were a number of MLB projects that we just didn't win or were there. It was just a quiet year for MLB.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Okay. When does the activity start getting underway for next year's NFL? In other words, what hit your backlog this year at this time?
Reece Kurtenbach
Yes, the closer you get to 120 day window, the less likely it is that they will be successful on really the size of the systems that they are putting into the NFL. So as you get four months before the preseason games, that's when that window starts to close.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Okay, and it sounds like the warranty, the release mentioned the warranty coming down in the quarter. How much area was that and is there further upside for you guys there?
Sheila Mae Anderson
We continue to work on warranty through business that Reece mentioned earlier. Our warranty through the quarter was 1.8% compared to year-to-date, we are at about 2.5%. So it was helpful for the quarter on the warranty side.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Okay and then lastly, excluding the mix factors if you could characterize what you think of the margin of the backlog, it would be helpful.
Sheila Mae Anderson
We don't have that necessarily but the large projects do, as we have talked about historically, have a lower gross margins due to the installation factors and that's just the competitive nature of those projects and we have the large projects, like Reece mentioned, in our backlog and we will be working to those in Q4 and in to some more months.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Okay and maybe I should clarify it a bit. If you could maybe characterize the pricing or the competitive environment?
Reece Kurtenbach
While these markets still are competitive, we are not seen a dramatic shift in pricing from last year, if that's closer to the mark to your question.
Steve Altebrando - Sidoti & Company
Yes, it is. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And presenters, at this time, it looks like there are no additional questioners in the queue. I would like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.

Reece Kurtenbach
We thank everybody for attending the call today and we appreciate the questions. And there is no further questions, we wish you all a good day and a happy spring.
Operator
Thank you, presenters, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Than you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may now all disconnect.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Daktronics Fiscal Year 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, November 19, 2013, and is available on the company's website at www.daktronics.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sheila Anderson, Chief Financial Officer for Daktronics, for some introductory remarks. Please go ahead, Sheila.
Sheila Mae Anderson
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our second quarter and earnings conference call. I would like to review our disclosures cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts, we will be discussing forward-looking statements, reflecting our expectation and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may be out of our control and may cause actual results to differ materially. Such risks include changes in economic condition, changes in the competitive and market landscape, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts, fluctuations of margins, the introduction of new products and technology and other important factors as noted and detailed in our 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings. At this time, I would like to introduce Reece Kurtenbach, our President and CEO, for a few comments.
Reece A. Kurtenbach
Thanks, Sheila, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Overall, we had a great second quarter with quarter-over-quarter increases in both orders and revenues. While our top line was higher, our gross profit as a percent of revenue was lower than last year at this time. Most of the differences in gross profit were due to project mix. We had a higher percentage of large video projects, which tend have to have a lower margin. However, warranty can still be a challenge, and we remain committed to reducing these expenses over the long term by continued investment in reliability and quality in both our product designs and our production processes. Our business tends to be cyclical and the summer months are our busiest. Our teams did a great job in handling this peak volume again this year. And I would like to thank all of our employees, suppliers and service partners for their hard work over the last quarter. We were successful due to their efforts. As I said, our business is cyclical and our third quarter is typically our lowest in revenue. This year, our backlog entering the period is slightly higher than last year, and our pipeline continues to be strong. Because of this, we believe we will see year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2014, and we continue to have a positive outlook for the year as a whole. Increases in order volume were mainly in our large video projects. We had significant orders in both the Sports and Commercial segments worldwide. However, we continue to see strong activity in our billboard and Transportation businesses as well. We are receiving billboard orders for new locations, as well as refurbishment or replacement of existing displays. And the release of our full-color product for transportation use is a significant factor in our increases in this business segment. I would once again point out that the year-over-year comparison for Transportation is down because of a significant order in FY 2013 for the new Tom Bradley terminal in L.A., even though the core business of what we call Transportation continues to grow.

Our markets are still very dynamic and competitive. We believe we will need to keep a strong focus on both product development and process improvement to be successful over the long-term. In product development, we remained focus on leveraging our investments through the creation of product platforms for both display and control systems. As an example, in Q1, we released our new design of 15-millimeter outdoor display systems using surface mount LEDs. And in Q2, we shipped our first derivative of this design, a 10-millimeter product, and we are working on higher resolutions as well. On the process side, we continue to follow Lean principles of continuous improvement for our production and business processes. Looking forward, we are seeing increased activity in our major segments of Sports, Commercial and Transportation business worldwide, and we are optimistic of our future business. Some comments on specific segments. In our Commercial business, we see orders in billboard picking up as we move through this calendar year, and we now feel this will extend into calendar 2014. We also have a strong pipeline in large projects area of this business, and we see this area continuing to grow through the fiscal year. Overall, we are expecting modest year-over-year growth in Commercial in our FY 2014. In Live Events, we continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels to increase the size and capability of their display systems. These customers tend to upgrade after about 10 years, and the trend is to install larger systems capable of high-definition video, as well as dynamic digital advertising. The largest systems are for the major league stadiums and arenas in the U.S., but this drives interest through all other areas of sport and entertainment, both in the U.S. and internationally. This holds true in our High School Sports business as well, even though we saw order and revenue decline for this specific market in the year-over-year comparison. We believe this is due to timing of large video systems and not a long-term trend. We see continued growth opportunities in each of these markets.
Our third-party advertising business continues to be strong internationally. We see an increasing shift to digital as technology prices have come down, and the expansion of our product line through the acquisition in Belgium that we completed in Q1 has increased our ability to deliver a complete solution to these customers, and we continue to win orders and install projects worldwide.
In general, we believe there's a lot of growth potential in our International business. Our Transportation is still -- business is still strong, and we see the core business to continue to grow even though a year-over-year comparison will be skewed due to the LAX project mentioned earlier.
Overall, we are optimistic about our future. We continue to focus on our internal goals of improving operating margin. We are the world leader in many of our markets. We have great products, great people, and we continue to make progress in reducing cost through eliminating waste and improving our processes. And this work is still ongoing. We feel we are positioned well to continue to achieve some top line growth, and we will maintain our focus on cost reduction and bottom line performance as we go forward. I'll turn it over to Sheila.
Sheila Mae Anderson
Thank you, Reece. We were pleased to reach a level of sales that is the highest for a quarter since our fiscal year 2009. Our plans, processes, service partners and suppliers and people helped us to convert $161 million of sales from the $167 million of backlog we had going into this quarter. This equated to a sales increase of 7.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013. International, Commercial and Live Events sales all increased, primarily due to the increase in the large video project orders we were able to secure, build and deliver. Transportation and Schools and Theatres sales decreased as compared to the same quarter last year. Transportation sales reduction is a result of approximately $5 million of revenue we realized last year to finish up a procurement contract during the same timeframe without a similar type of project this quarter. Schools and Theatres sales declined as some large video project displays slipped into calendar 2014, and the projects we won were smaller projects compared to last year, and therefore, lower average sales prices were realized per order. We continue to estimate a modest growth rate overall for fiscal 2014. While our second half has historically been lower in sales and profitability than the first half of the year, because of the sports and construction seasonality we do have more optimism in this year's second half than last year. We continue to see strong interest from our customers and large projects in the marketplace and Live Events, International and Commercial business units, as Reece mentioned. With the increase in backlog as compared to last year, the current booked project delivery schedules and potential new orders in the third quarter, which we anticipate some converting into sales, we estimate revenues to trend modestly higher as compared to last year's third quarter. Last year, we recognized $111 million of sales during that quarter. Gross profit in the second quarter was 26.8% compared to 28.2% of the second quarter of last year. We anticipated a decrease in gross margin percent compared to last year due to the sales mix we had going into the quarter. As we work on larger million-dollar-plus contracts, the margin earned as a percent of sales is lower than our standard video displays and scoring systems. Thus, due to the competitive environment, as well as the amount of installation work that's included in these type of projects, last year's second quarter had a higher volumes of standard orders as compared to this year's second quarter, where we had more larger contracts work done. Warranty was 3.3% of sales, which is slightly higher than the same period last year of 3%. We continue to focus on lowering warranty issues by investing in quality through process improvement, supply chain management and product design. Looking ahead, gross profit for the third quarter is expected to be similar to that as of the third quarter of last year and less than the second quarter of this year. During this third quarter, we have a number of holidays and utilize the plant and infrastructure less, causing the projected decline in margin. Operating expenses were 16% of sales compared to 17% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. In dollars, operating expenses increased 1% from last year during the same quarter. We plan to continue to make necessary investments in product development, process improvements and our IT infrastructure while managing costs to allow us to continue to grow profitably. For fiscal 2014, we predict a slight increase in operating expenses in dollars to support business growth, but are working to hold expenses flat to down as a percentage of sales for the total year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 35% last year, and this lower rate is reflective of the benefits we received from the research and development credit, which is -- had not been reinstated last year at this same time. We are forecasting our effective tax rate for the fiscal 2014 to be approximately in the 35% range. However, that rate can fluctuate depending on which tax jurisdiction sales are procured in the world. With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Morris Ajzenman with Griffin Securities.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Just a follow-up. Sheila, on your kind of guidance for the third quarter, revenue is up modestly, I think you said, year-over-year and down sequentially, which is not a surprise being the second quarter is a seasonally high quarter. But if you count on gross margins -- I'm looking at the third quarter of last year, I think it's at 24.4%, and I think you said it will be similar to last year. I'm just curious, shouldn't we see some leveraging with modest top line growth rates? There's been a control low warranty expense that's come into play here. But shouldn't this still be an improvement in the gross margins going forward into this current quarter?
Sheila Mae Anderson
As discussed, there it has to do with mix, as well as in our utilization of the factory. So yes, we will have some uptick because of the revenue uptick. But conservatively, we feel we'll be in that area because of the sales mix going into the quarter.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
All right. And you said utilization -- is there any reason to believe utilization in this third quarter is going to be significantly different than last year's third quarter?
Sheila Mae Anderson
It shouldn't be significantly different.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And just give me a little bit more color on the warranty expense, 3.3% in this most recent quarter. Can you just refresh what it was the previous quarter? And you still target at getting that, the 150, 200 basis points?
Sheila Mae Anderson
We do and are working towards reducing our warranty as a percent of sales, and our target is that 2% or so. I don't have last quarter's right with me here, but we have and want to reduce that from the 3.3% that we experienced this quarter.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brad Mas with Needham.
Unknown Analyst
Brad filling in for Jim. Just first regarding the billboard portion of the Commercial segment, I was wondering if you could provide any revenue or bookings numbers?
Sheila Mae Anderson
For the quarter in revenue, we had about $12 million of sales.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. And then orders?
Sheila Mae Anderson
Orders were -- one moment. Were about $11 million.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. And then with the International segment, there's obviously good growth. Do you think it's sustainable going forward? And where -- like what segments were you seeing the strength coming from internationally?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
We believe that the growth is sustainable internationally, and the biggest segments that we see interest in is the large sports venues, these large commercial spectaculars and third-party advertising or billboard.
Unknown Analyst
Okay. And then just lastly, Transportation. We obviously saw decent order activity. Do you have any visibility into the pipeline or any opportunities in the Transportation segment?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
We do believe that our Transportation segment, the core business, will continue to grow. And so we're optimistic as we go into the second half that the order and revenue would increase.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Altebrando with Sidoti & Company.
Stephen Altebrando - Sidoti & Company, LLC
In the Schools and Theatres, the release mentions ASPs being down a bit. Is that a function of mix or pricing, competitive pricing?
Sheila Mae Anderson
We believe that's a part of just the mix. We feel we were selling smaller display units compared to last year.
Stephen Altebrando - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay. And then the Live Events segment mentioned, I think, maybe 5 -- I think it was 5 orders for $9 million or so. It sounds like a relatively small order dollar amount per order. Are those nonprofessional arenas or ancillary products?

Reece A. Kurtenbach
What we see in the Live Events business is that orders in Q2 and maybe even part of Q3 tend to be add-ons, not complete system orders. And what we find is that in the spring months, as we move into baseball, and then the fall season is where we get the larger full-system orders.
Stephen Altebrando - Sidoti & Company, LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, and I know you touched on it on the script a bit. But if you could expand on kind of the bidding activity you're seeing in the Live Events segment, just the general interest that you're seeing, whether it feels like it's picking up as we go into fiscal '15?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
We've seen much higher activity this year, especially in large outdoor stadiums, than in the previous, I would say, 2 years. And we believe that, that will continue into the fall, certainly.
Operator
Our next question comes from Morris Ajzenman with Griffin Securities.
Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division
Sheila, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks -- and you kind of ran through it quickly. I'm not sure if I got it right. Transportation, did you say $17.6 million last year, $5 million was from the LAX? Or did I misread you on that?
Sheila Mae Anderson
Actually, $5 million was from another procurement project. LAX contributed to our orders through the second quarter of last year, and we had some revenue realized in the second quarter from LAX. But we had a large procurement project that we finished up during the first half of last year, which that we didn't have a repeat-type project this first half of the year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Hoffman with Princeton OPportunity Partners.
Robert Hoffman
It seems, especially for those of us who are on the East Coast, that the proliferation of transportation signs, and it's nice to see the Vanguard label on all of these things and especially here in New Jersey. Do you have any sense of -- I get the impression that the highways that put them on start with X and then end up with 3x X over the period of a number of years. Do you have any sense of the market opportunity? I mean, are there big competitors that are taking share in other places? Or is it something that you see you have 5 to 10 years of pretty dramatic growth opportunity when you can see the results of what good signage does for traffic flow? In other words, can you give us any sense of long-term market opportunity in Transportation?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
So in the traffic business, there's especially the over-the-road signage that I think you're referencing in New Jersey and some of the other states. I believe, as you're mentioning, the core technology is seen as beneficial. It's expensive to build highways, and putting in signage like we provide helps makes the usage of your existing highways more efficient. So we see that, that's a continuing part of a highway project going forward. However, the procurement progress -- process is done through either a state or maybe a county or city level, and there is a heavy influence of federal dollars that often greenlight these projects. And it's difficult to project from year-to-year how the federal government will choose to lease or not certain funds, which puts a difficulty in estimating future business in the Transportation area.
Robert Hoffman
How about internationally? Are you seeing the same sort of interest in International appearances?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
As I said before, currently, our focus in International is in these other segments, and we haven't -- the selling cycle in Transportation tends to be quite long, as you need to work to get qualified by different governmental agencies. And we haven't taken that approach yet in our International business. Not to say that we haven't done some transportation type of projects, but not these large procurement type of projects for over-the-road signage.

Robert Hoffman
But are there -- are they being -- so other people are out there doing those? Or is the international market [indiscernible] the U.S.?
Reece A. Kurtenbach
Yes, there are definitely companies internationally that are participating in those markets. And you will see similar types of displays if you travel the major cities and highways around the world.
Operator
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our hosts for closing remarks.
Sheila Mae Anderson
I will answer Morris' question earlier about warranty as a percentage of sales for the first quarter. We also were at about 3.3% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, so we've trended that way throughout the whole first half.
Reece A. Kurtenbach
Thank you, Sheila. I think that concludes our comments. We appreciate everybody's time and attention this morning, and we hope you have a great Thanksgiving holiday.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.
