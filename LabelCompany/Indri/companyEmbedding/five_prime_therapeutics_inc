Comprehensive Protein Library
Five Prime’s library of over 5,600 human extracellular proteins, which we believe represent substantially all of the body’s medically important targets for protein therapeutics, is encoded by full-length cDNAs that include both the “5 prime” as well as the “3 prime” end of each cDNA.  The 5 prime end is the most difficult part of the expressed gene to copy using traditional technology generally available to scientists.  Read More


Proprietary Platform
Our drug discovery platform combines complex cell-based screens with a proprietary in vivo screening system to increase the speed and precision of identifying, analyzing and assessing protein drug targets and candidates. We can produce and test thousands of extracellular proteins each week. Read More


Proven Protein Drug Discovery
We are a leader in the discovery of new targets and innovative protein therapeutics.  We are pursuing clinical development of our product candidates both independently and in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners. Read More





A Growing
Pipeline
of Novel Drug
Candidates.



Five Prime has three products that are in or nearing clinical development, with an initial focus on cancer and inflammatory diseases. Through our proprietary protein discovery platform, we have identified several other promising drug targets and candidates that we are validating preclinically.

Company Information | Protein Therapeutics | Five Prime Therapeutics























Company






CompanyFive Prime is a leader in the discovery and development of innovative protein therapeutics.
We have developed a library of more than 5,700 human extracellular proteins, which we believe represent substantially all of the body’s medically important targets for protein therapeutics.
Building on this expertise in protein science, we have developed proprietary high-throughput protein screening technologies that we use to identify new targets for protein therapeutics in relatively short periods of time. As a result, we have built a pipeline of novel product candidates for cancer and inflammatory diseases.
Our drug discovery platform has also made us a sought-after discovery and development partner. To date we entered into multiple collaborations with partners, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline and UCB Pharma.
Our strategy is to be opportunistic in our development programs. Pursuing clinical development of our product candidates both independently and in collaborations allows us to enhance the capital resources needed to strengthen our core technology and expand our product pipeline.

Comprehensive Protein Library
Five Prime’s library of over 5,600 human extracellular proteins, which we believe represent substantially all of the body’s medically important targets for protein therapeutics, is encoded by full-length cDNAs that include both the “5 prime” as well as the “3 prime” end of each cDNA.  The 5 prime end is the most difficult part of the expressed gene to copy using traditional technology generally available to scientists.  Read More


Proprietary Platform
Our drug discovery platform combines complex cell-based screens with a proprietary in vivo screening system to increase the speed and precision of identifying, analyzing and assessing protein drug targets and candidates. We can produce and test thousands of extracellular proteins each week. Read More


Proven Protein Drug Discovery
We are a leader in the discovery of new targets and innovative protein therapeutics.  We are pursuing clinical development of our product candidates both independently and in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners. Read More
