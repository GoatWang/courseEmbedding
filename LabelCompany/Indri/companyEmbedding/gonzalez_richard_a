Richard A. Gonzalez





Abbott spinoff CEO lacks claimed degrees


(Crain's) — Abbott Laboratories misstated the education credentials of Richard Gonzalez, the executive tapped to head its pharmaceutical spinoff, in at least nine regulatory filings between 2002 and 2007, Crain's has found.Mr. Gonzalez did not receive a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Houston, nor a master's degree in biochemistry from the University of Miami, contrary to claims in Abbott's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when the longtime company executive was a director. He retired from Abbott as president and chief operating officer in 2007 but returned two years later.In October, Mr. Gonzalez was named CEO of AbbVie, which is projected to have $18 billion in annual sales after it is spun off later this year. Without a college degree, he seemingly would be a rarity among CEOs of major corporations.
Will Gonzalez get a pass on padded bio?Investors may focus instead on his 30-year-plus track record at the healthcare giant, analysts said Friday.Read the story.
Since his return, Abbott has softened the details about his educational background. Mr. Gonzalez, 58, “was a research biochemist at the University of Miami School of Medicine and attended the University of Houston, majoring in biochemistry, according to  the company's website.Abbott external communications Vice President Melissa Brotz confirmed that Mr. Gonzalez did not receive degrees from either university.The inaccurate information about his education was included in SEC filings as a result of an internal administrative error. Ms. Brotz declined to say exactly when Abbott learned about the errors, except to say it was “some time ago.” The company corrected the information on its website immediately after the errors were discovered, she said.
Checking references

Richard Gonzalez, named CEO of AbbVie when it is spun off from Abbott Laboratories later this year, is just the latest example of a prominent figure caught up in misstatements of educational achievements. 

In May, Scott Thompson left as CEO of Yahoo Inc. after a shareholder in the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Internet company revealed that Mr. Thompson's bachelor's degree from Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., was in business, not computer science, as described in a company biography and regulatory filings. Patti Hart, the Yahoo director who led to search to hire Mr. Thompson, also stepped down. Her bachelor's degree from Illinois State University was in business administration, not marketing and economics, as was claimed in her bio. 

Other examples include: 

• Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Marilee Jones, 2007: Ms. Jones resigned as dean of admissions, saying she had misled the school about her academic degrees on her application to work there 28 years earlier. 

• Radio Shack Corp., Dave Edmondson, 2006: Mr. Edmondson resigned after 11 years with the Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer, including eight months as CEO, after acknowledging he had neither of the two college degrees he had claimed. 

• Bausch & Lomb Inc., Ronald Zarrella, 2002: Mr. Zarrella's $1.1 million bonus was taken away after he admitted he didn't hold the MBA from New York University that appeared on his resume for a decade. The board declined his offer to resign. He retired from the Rochester, N.Y.-based eye products company in 2008. 

• Veritas Software Corp., Kenneth Lonchar, 2002: Mr. Lonchar resigned as chief financial officer after admitting he falsely claimed to hold an MBA from Stanford University. The company — whose name means "truth" in Latin — was acquired by Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec Corp. in 2005. 

• Notre Dame, George O'Leary, 2001: Mr. O'Leary resigned as head football coach five days after being hired, admitting he misrepresented his academic and athletic background. Since 2004, he has been the coach at University of Central Florida. 

(Sources: AP, Crain's reporting)

“There's really no issue here with respect to his educational background and his ability to lead AbbVie,” Ms. Brotz said. “His ability to lead AbbVie is evidenced by his distinguished career over 30 years, culminating in his reaching the highest levels of the company.”The inaccurate information about Mr. Gonzalez's academic achievements continues to be repeated by several well-known national listings of senior corporate executives, including Reuters and Bloomberg Businessweek.In SEC filings about the spinoff since it was announced nearly a year ago, Abbott has not included any biographical details about Mr. Gonzalez. He is executive vice president of the company's pharmaceutical products group and was hand-picked by CEO Miles White to take the top spot at AbbVie. When spun off at year-end, AbbVie will take with it Humira, the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug that in 2011 reaped nearly $8 billion in sales, or about 20 percent of the $38.9 billion Abbott posted in total revenue.The new company will focus on on-patent pharmaceuticals, while the legacy firm, which will still be called Abbott, is expected to log about $22 billion in revenue and maintain current nutritional, medical device and branded generic business lines.According to his online biography at Abbott's website, Mr. Gonzalez joined Abbott in 1977 and held several management positions before retiring in 2007 as president and chief operating officer, the company's No. 2 position. Ms. Brotz says Mr. Gonzalez's website bio is now correct.After being treated for throat cancer, he returned to the company in 2009 to oversee Abbott Ventures, the company's medical technology investment arm, and has held his current job since mid-2010.Records show that Richard Allen Gonzalez, with a birth date consistent with Mr. Gonzalez's, attended the University of Houston from the fall of 1972 to the fall of 1973, but was not granted a degree, according to a school spokeswoman. Mr. Gonzalez's status at the University of Miami could not immediately be confirmed.

About the Author:
                                                  Rafael C. Gonzalez  received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Miami in 1965 and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 1967 and 1970, respectively. He joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in 1970, where he became Associate Professor in 1973, Professor in 1978, and Distinguished Service Professor in 1984. He served as Chairman of the department from 1994 through 1997. He is currently a Professor Emeritus at UTK.  Gonzalez is the founder of the Image & Pattern Analysis Laboratory and the Robotics & Computer Vision Laboratory at the University of Tennessee. He also founded Perceptics Corporation in 1982 and was its president until 1992. The last three years of this period were spent under a full-time employment contract with Westinghouse Corporation, who acquired the company in 1989.  Under his direction, Perceptics became highly successful in image processing, computer vision, and laser disk storage technology. In its initial ten years, Perceptics introduced a series of innovative products, including: The world's first commercially-available computer vision system for automatically reading the license plate on moving vehicles; a series of large-scale image processing and archiving systems used by the U.S. Navy at six different manufacturing sites throughout the country to inspect the rocket motors of missiles in the Trident II Submarine Program; the market leading family of imaging boards for advanced Macintosh computers; and a line of trillion-byte laser disk products.  He is a frequent consultant to industry and government in the areas of pattern recognition, image processing, and machine learning. His academic honors for work in these fields include the 1977 UTK College of Engineering Faculty Achievement Award; the 1978 UTK Chancellor's Research Scholar Award; the 1980 Magnavox Engineering Professor Award; and the 1980 M.E. Brooks Distinguished Professor Award. In 1981 he became an IBM Professor at the University of Tennessee and in 1984 he was named a Distinguished Service Professor there. He was awarded a Distinguished Alumnus Award by the University of Miami in 1985, the Phi Kappa Phi Scholar Award in 1986, and the University of Tennessee's Nathan W. Dougherty Award for Excellence in Engineering in 1992.  Honors for industrial accomplishment include the 1987 IEEE Outstanding Engineer Award for Commercial Development in Tennessee; the 1988 Albert Rose Nat'l Award for Excellence in Commercial Image Processing; the 1989 B. Otto Wheeley Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer; the 1989 Coopers and Lybrand Entrepreneur of the Year Award; the 1992 IEEE Region 3 Outstanding Engineer Award; and the 1993 Automated Imaging Association National Award for Technology Development.  Gonzalez is author or co-author of over 100 technical articles, two edited books, and four textbooks in the fields of pattern recognition, image processing and robotics. His books are used in over 500 universities and research institutions throughout the world. He is listed in the prestigious Marquis Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who in Engineering, Marquis Who's Who in the World, and in 10 other national and international biographical citations. He ii the co-holder of two U.S. Patents, and has been an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, and the International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences. He is a member of numerous professional and honorary societies, including Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, Eta Kapp Nu, and Sigma Xi. He is a Fellow of the IEEE.      Richard E. Woods  earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His professional experiences range from entrepreneurial to the more traditional academic, consulting; governmental, and industrial pursuits. Most recently, he founded MedData Interactive, a high technology company specializing in the development of hand-held computer systems for medical applications. He was also a founder and Vice President of Perceptics Corporation, where he was responsible for the development of many of the company's quantitative image analysis and autonomous decision making products.  Prior to Perceptics and MedData, Dr. Woods was an Assistant Professor off Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee: and prior to that, a computer applications engineer at Union Carbide Corporation. As a consultant, he has been involved in the development of a number of special-purpose digital processors for a variety of space and military agencies, including NASA, the Ballistic Missile Systems Command, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Dr. Woods has published numerous articles related to digital signal processing and is a member of several professional societies, including Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and the IEEE. In 1986, he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineering Alumnus of the University of Tennessee.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREData Analysis For Experimental Designsby Gonzalez, RichardThis engaging text shows how statistics and methods work together, demonstrating a variety of techniques for evaluating statistical results against the specifics of the methodological design. Richard Gonzalez elucidates the fundamental concepts involved in analysis of variance (ANOVA), focusing on single degree-of-freedom tests, or comparisons, wherever possible. Potential threats to making a causal inference from an experimental design are highlighted. With an emphasis on basic between-subjects and within-subjects designs, Gonzalez resists presenting the countless &quot;exceptions to the rule&quot; that make many statistics textbooks so unwieldy and confusing for students and beginning researchers. Ideal for graduate courses in experimental design or data analysis, the text may also be used by advanced undergraduates preparing to do senior theses.Useful pedagogical features include:*Discussions of the assumptions that underlie each statistical test*Sequential, step-by-step presentations of statistical procedures*End-of-chapter questions and exercises*Accessible writing style with scenarios and examples*A companion Web page (www.umich.edu/~gonzo/daed) offering data and syntax files in R and SPSS for the research examples used in the book, a short guide to SPSS syntax, and detailed course notes on each of the book's topics.Statistics, Research, StatisticsCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

  Introduce your students to image processing with the industry’s most prized text  For 40 years,  Image Processing has been the foundational text for the study of digital image processing. The book is suited for students at the college senior and first-year graduate level with prior background in mathematical analysis, vectors, matrices, probability, statistics, linear systems, and computer programming. As in all earlier editions, the focus of this edition of the book is on fundamentals.    The 4th Edition, which celebrates the book’s 40th anniversary, is based on an extensive survey of faculty, students, and independent readers in 150 institutions from 30 countries. Their feedback led to expanded or new coverage of topics such as deep learning and deep neural networks, including convolutional neural nets, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), maximally-stable extremal regions (MSERs), graph cuts, k-means clustering and superpixels, active contours (snakes and level sets), and exact histogram matching.  Major improvements were made in reorganizing the material on image transforms into a more cohesive presentation, and in the discussion of spatial kernels and spatial filtering.  Major revisions and additions were made to examples and homework exercises throughout the book. For the first time, we added MATLAB projects at the end of every chapter, and compiled support packages for you and your teacher containing, solutions, image databases, and sample code.       The support materials for this title can be found at www.ImageProcessingPlace.com

In its initial ten years, Perceptics introduced a series of innovative products, including: The world's first commercially-available computer vision system for automatically reading the license plate on moving vehicles; a series of large-scale image processing and archiving systems used by the U.S. Navy at six different manufacturing sites throughout the country to inspect the rocket motors of missiles in the Trident II Submarine Program; the market leading family of imaging boards for advanced Macintosh computers; and a line of trillion-byte laserdisc products.    He is a frequent consultant to industry and government in the areas of pattern recognition, image processing, and machine learning. His academic honors for work in these fields include the 1977 UTK College of Engineering Faculty Achievement Award; the 1978 UTK Chancellor's Research Scholar Award; the 1980 Magnavox Engineering Professor Award; and the 1980 M.E. Brooks Distinguished Professor Award. In 1981 he became an IBM Professor at the University of Tennessee and in 1984 he was named a Distinguished Service Professor there. He was awarded a Distinguished Alumnus Award by the University of Miami in 1985, the Phi Kappa Phi Scholar Award in 1986, and the University of Tennessee's Nathan W. Dougherty Award for Excellence in Engineering in 1992.   Honors for industrial accomplishment include the 1987 IEEE Outstanding Engineer Award for Commercial Development in Tennessee; the 1988 Albert Rose Nat'l Award for Excellence in Commercial Image Processing; the 1989 B. Otto Wheeley Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer; the 1989 Coopers and Lybrand Entrepreneur of the Year Award; the 1992 IEEE Region 3 Outstanding Engineer Award; and the 1993 Automated Imaging Association National Award for Technology Development.   Gonzalez is author or co-author of over 100 technical articles, two edited books, and four textbooks in the fields of pattern recognition, image processing and robotics. His books are used in over 500 universities and research institutions throughout the world. He is listed in the prestigious Marquis Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who in Engineering, Marquis Who's Who in the World, and in 10 other national and international biographical citations. He ii is the co-holder of two U.S. Patents, and has been an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, and the International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences. He is a member of numerous professional and honorary societies, including Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, Eta Kapp Nu, and Sigma Xi. He is a Fellow of the IEEE.     Richard E. Woods earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in 1975, 1977, and 1980, respectively. He became an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1981 and was recognized as a Distinguished Engineering Alumnus in 1986.    A veteran hardware and software developer, Dr. Woods has been involved in the founding of several high-technology startups, including Perceptics Corporation, where he was responsible for the development of the company’s quantitative image analysis and autonomous decision-making products; MedData Interactive, a high technology company specializing in the development of handheld computer systems for medical applications; and Interapptics, an internet-based company that designs desktop and handheld computer applications.    Dr. Woods currently serves on several nonprofit educational and media-related boards, including Johnson University, and was recently a summer English instructor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. He is the holder of a U.S. Patent in the area of digital image processing and has published two textbooks, as well as numerous articles related to digital signal processing. Dr. Woods is a member of several professional societies, including Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and the IEEE.

The examples are clear and understandable.As the book progresses, the subjects become more complex and mathematically-oriented. I found that I could follow up with those topics in which I had prior background, like intensity transformations, spatial filtering, filtering in the frequency domain, color image processing, image compression and image segmentation. In these topics I understood most of what they were explaining, except maybe the last pages of each chapter.When it came to chapters where I was weaker or not familiar at all, I have to admit that I was able to keep up only with the first pages of each one. More specifically: Wavelets and multithreshold processing, morphological image processing, representation, fuzzy logic and object recognition. These chapters became muddy very quickly, and I only got a general feeling about what they were explaining.Maybe someone with an electrical engineering background (myself being mechanical/software) would understand better the advanced topics.I plan to read them again once I have a practical need or use for those areas.The book does not contain code samples but it has quite a lot of practical use examples with pictures.In summary, I understood roughly 65% of the book and would recommend it to anyone who needs a better understanding of image processing.Best RegardsAriRead more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsEven better than the first editionByjhaon October 5, 2008Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis book is a wonderful read about image processing.  Having read most of the 1st edition (yes I'm reading all of the 3rd), I can say that this 3rd edition is larger (yet not insurmountable) with more examples, explanations, mathematical development and new material.  I'm currently in the chapter about frequency domain processing and must say that the previous chapter about spatial domain processing is more robust, even now including a good introduction to fuzzy logic.  Anyhow, with a good background in applied math and Matlab programming, this material is easy reading for me, but should also be accessible enough for anyone with a general technical background.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA Valuable Learning AidByThomas Edwardon August 10, 2015Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI just completed a semester of Digital Image Processing where this was the course textbook.  Of the myriad textbooks I have used over the years, this one is definitely at the top of my list in terms of its clarity and organization.  I ended up reading at least two thirds of this textbook, and the way that the authors present the material makes it very clear in most cases.  I came away with the sense that the authors expended a great deal of effort in illustrating and explaining the concepts - more so than many textbooks I have encountered, especially those at the graduate engineering level.My only criticism is that certain parts of chapters 7 and 8 seemed a bit too extensive for an introductory image processing text; however, they were still good chapters and so I don't think that it warrants a deduction of a star in my rating.I highly recommend this text if you need to take an image processing course.Read more0Comment|
