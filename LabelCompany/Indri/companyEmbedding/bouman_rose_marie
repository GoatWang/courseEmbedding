Consensus Ratings for MB Financial (NASDAQ:MBFI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 5 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.44)Consensus Price Target: $48.57 (19.93% upside)

Searching
Entering terms in the main search box will return results where those terms occur anywhere in the record. You may target your search to certain fields by changing the dropdown selection to the right of the 'Search' box from "All Fields."
Facets
Use the "facets" to limit your searches. These are the links at the left under the "Limit your search" heading, with categories such as "Record Type," "Language," and "Online." You may find "Record Type" to be particularly helpful in narrowing your search to certain type of record.
Advanced Search
An advanced search is available by clicking the link "More Options (Advanced Search)". If you were, for example, interested in searching across photographic records or document records only, excluding other record types, in the advanced search you can click on "Record Type" and select one or more type of records from the list to limit your results to those selected record types.
Geographic Name Expansion
Collections Search also embodies a "geographic name expansion" feature. Often the same place is referred through different names in different languages and various spellings and transliterations. For example, searching for "Lviv", "L'viv", "L'vov", "Lvov", "Lwow", or "Lemberg" will all bring you the same results. Similarly, searching for "Łódź", "Lodz", or "Litzmannstadt" will bring the same results, as will searching for "Munich", "München", or "Muenchen."
Boolean Queries
Collections Search supports boolean queries including AND, NOT, and OR (which must be uppercase) and parentheses. For example, searching:
york NOT ( "new york" OR "memorial books") 
		results in records including the term "york" but excluding records containing either "new york" or "memorial books."

Memorial Trees by Honoring a Life




    When you choose to have a memorial tree planted for your loved one, you are doing more than simply putting a plant in the ground.
    You are making a long-term commitment to the environment and implanting the memories of your loved one in our planet for countless
    years to come. A memorial tree is a unique tribute which provides global benefits like no other memorial gift could.




        What is a memorial tree?
    



What you receive:

A memorial tree planted in the area of greatest need, according to the planting schedule of the American Forests Organization. 
A memorial card to be sent to your home, or a person of your choosing which demonstrates the gift you have given.
Your name and message listed in this online memorial, and on the honoringalife.org website.



                    In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for 
family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.
