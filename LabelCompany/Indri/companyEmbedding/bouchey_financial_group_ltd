Our Clients

We act as our clients’ personal Chief Financial Officer and ensure that their overall financial goals are met in a responsible way, through the combination of comprehensive financial planning and active portfolio management.
The one common theme in all of our client relationships is that they rely on us to simplify and coordinate their complex financial situations. This in turn provides them with peace of mind and allows them to better utilize one of their most precious resources – their time.
Who We Serve
Those we work with include successful professionals, physicians, corporate executives, business owners, entrepreneurs, individuals, families, pension plans, foundations and endowments.  While many of our clients come to us from the Capital Region, our firm’s commitment to the latest technology has allowed us to service clients anywhere in the country, or even the world. With convenient locations in Troy and Saratoga Springs, one of our financial advisors is never far from serving those in the Capital Region.
Long Lasting Relationships
Bouchey Financial Group, Ltd.’s expertise, creativity, and dedication to our clients has translated into meaningful, long-standing relationships. When we take on new clients, they become part of our extended family, and in the past two decades we have developed multi-generational relationships with many of them.
Your Confidentiality
The privacy and confidentiality of our clients’ information is paramount to all of our client relationships.  In a time when personal data is more vulnerable than ever, our firm goes the extra mile to help protect our clients and the security of their data.
