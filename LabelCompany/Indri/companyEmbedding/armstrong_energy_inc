 2  Excludes production royalty to related party, depreciation, depletion, and amortization; asset retirement obligation expenses; and general and administrative costs. 




Revenue from coal sales of $59.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 2.2% lower than the comparable period of the prior year primarily due to an unfavorable price variance.  The price variance of $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was driven primarily by the renewal of sales contracts at less favorable prices, as well as unfavorable transportation adjustments included as a component of the price in certain of our long-term coal supply agreements as a result of declining diesel prices. This was partially offset by a favorable volume variance experienced for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $2.0 million, as compared to the same period of 2016, due to the timing of shipments. 
Costs of coal sales of $51.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 2.6% lower than the comparable period of the prior year due primarily to improved operating efficiency. On a per ton basis, cost of coal sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $34.87, which represents a decrease of $2.12 per ton, as compared to the same period of 2016. The decrease in the cost of coal sales per ton for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016, is due to the closure of our Parkway underground mine in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was a high cost operation, and improved operating efficiency at our Kronos underground mine from increased production due to higher demand for higher quality coal, partially offset by higher overall costs at our surface operations from mining in higher ratio reserves. 
General and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was $0.6 million lower than the comparable period in 2016. The decrease is due primarily to lower labor and benefits expense, information technology related costs, and insurance costs.
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $15.4 million, as compared to net loss of $13.4 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net loss of $2.0 million is due to an increase in interest expense and additional costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives of $1.3 million in 2017, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 is 29.9% lower than the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease resulted primarily from the inclusion in Adjusted EBITDA of the cash portion of production royalties paid to Thoroughbred Resources, LP (Thoroughbred) of $1.9 million, which began January 1, 2017, pursuant to existing lease terms and a settlement agreement we reached with Thoroughbred that became effective March 29, 2017 (the Settlement Agreement), partially offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses in the current quarter, as compared to the same period of 2016. 
Liquidity
The principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash on hand and, prior to its termination on November 14, 2016, availability under our revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2017, our total available liquidity was $51.8 million, which was comprised solely of cash on hand. 
We have experienced recurring losses from operations, which has led to a substantial decline in cash flows from operating activities over the last 18 months. Our current operating plan indicates that we will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Thoroughbred, whereby we agreed, among other things, to begin paying Thoroughbred all production royalties earned on or after January 1, 2017 in cash, as permitted under the existing lease terms (see " - Settlement Agreement with Thoroughbred" for more information with respect to the settlement agreement). Our continuing operating losses, negative cash flow projections and other liquidity risks raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
Due to our current financial outlook, we continue to take steps to preserve our liquidity and manage operating costs, including controlling capital expenditures. Beginning in 2015, we undertook steps to enhance our financial flexibility and reduce cash outflows in the near term, including a streamlining of our cost structure and anticipated reductions in production volumes and capital expenditures. In addition, we are actively negotiating a restructuring with advisers to certain holders of our 11.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the Notes), who collectively beneficially own or manage in excess of 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
We have engaged financial and legal advisers to assist us in restructuring our capital structure and evaluate other potential alternatives to address the impending liquidity constraints. However, there can be no assurance that any restructuring will be possible on acceptable terms, if at all. It may be difficult to come to an agreement that is acceptable to all of our creditors. Our failure to reach an agreement on the terms of a restructuring with our creditors would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a successful restructuring with the holders of the Notes is not achieved, it may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring, or our creditors could force us into an involuntary bankruptcy or liquidation.
Please read our Current Report on Form 10-Q filed today and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information about our current financial position, including the risks and uncertainties associated with restructuring the Notes.
Settlement Agreement with Thoroughbred
Starting in December 2016, we received the first of multiple communications from Thoroughbred Holdings GP, LLC (Thoroughbred Holdings), the general partner of Thoroughbred, alleging claims associated with various transactions between the parties. Thoroughbred Holdings claimed the third-party valuations prepared annually in order to determine the percentage interest in certain jointly-owned land and mineral reserves (the Jointly-Owned Property) to be transferred from us to Thoroughbred pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Royalty Deferment and Option Agreement (the Royalty Agreement) were inaccurate in 2016 and prior, which resulted in the underpayment of production royalties to Thoroughbred. In addition, Thoroughbred Holdings took exception to our calculation of the amount of deferred royalties for the year ended December 31, 2016, the amount of certain offsets from these deferred royalties by amounts due from Thoroughbred to us pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement, and the offset of certain production royalties that we overpaid to Thoroughbred on properties other than the Jointly-Owned Property.
As of December 31, 2016, amounts owed to Thoroughbred totaled $11.7 million, primarily representing deferred royalties incurred during calendar year 2016.  Consistent with the previous annual land and reserve transfers pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, Armstrong proposed to transfer a 10.95% undivided interest in the Jointly Owned Property in satisfaction of the amounts owed, which had been ascertained based on a fair market value determination obtained by us from an independent third-party.  As noted above, Thoroughbred objected to this amount, asserting that, based on its own valuation, 10.95% was substantially undervalued. Following a series of negotiations to resolve the dispute, Armstrong and Thoroughbred entered into a Settlement Agreement effective March 29, 2017 in which we agreed to transfer, and Thoroughbred agreed to accept, an additional 9.86% undivided interest in Jointly-Owned property for a total of 20.81%, bringing Thoroughbred's interest in the Jointly-Owned Property to 100% as of January 1, 2017. The additional 9.86% undivided interest was expected to be earned by Thoroughbred during the first half of 2017 regardless of the settlement. Furthermore, as part of the Settlement Agreement, Armstrong and Thoroughbred agreed to mutual waivers and releases related to the Royalty Agreement, the payment of production royalties or any other sums due under the leases prior to January 1, 2017, and the Administrative Services Agreement. Thoroughbred also waived and released any prior claims against us for lost or wasted coal or mining practices and operational decisions made by us; any other demands, claims, or assertions set forth in the various communications from Thoroughbred Holdings and its legal counsel to us; and any other claims arising from our administration of the leases prior to January 1, 2017. In addition, we agreed to begin paying Thoroughbred all production royalties earned on or after January 1, 2017 in cash pursuant to the existing lease terms, with royalties earned for January and February 2017 totaling $2.7 million being paid on March 31, 2017. By letter dated April 18, 2017, certain of the holders of the Notes expressed certain objections to entry into the Settlement Agreement.
Please refer to our Current Report on Form 10-Q filed today and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information regarding the settlement agreement.
Short-term Outlook
Armstrong currently has approximately 5.3 million tons committed and priced for 2017.  Capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be in the range of $12.0 million to $16.0 million. With respect to any significant development projects, we plan to defer them to time periods beyond 2017 and will continue to evaluate the timing associated with those projects based on changes in overall coal supply and demand.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). It is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.
We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income (loss) before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligation expenses, non-cash production royalty to related party, loss on settlement of interest rate swap, loss on deferment of equity offering, non-cash stock compensation expense (income), non-cash employee benefit expense, asset impairment and restructuring charges, costs incurred evaluating strategic alternatives, non-cash charges related to non-recourse notes, gain on deconsolidation, and (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is useful to an investor in evaluating our Company.
Various statements contained in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. Our forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "potential," "plan," "goal" or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. The forward-looking statements in this release speak only as of the date of this release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements unless required by law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. When considering any forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in our SEC filings, including the more detailed discussion of these factors and other factors that could affect our results included in "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2017.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
