Meet General Motors’ Alicia Boler-Davis [INTERVIEW]
As a Black woman, GM’s senior executive discusses breaking through the glass ceilings of race and gender






						by Gil Robertson IV,
						November 27, 2013			




Comments








This GM exec keeps the wheels turning



Making it in the auto industry is a tough climb for any executive, but when you’re Black and female, it’s doubly so. Which is why the success of Alicia Boler-Davis (senior vice president of global quality and global customer experience for General Motors) is so inspiring.

	During her nearly 20-year career with the auto giant, Davis has risen steadily through various organizations within the company, delivering superlative results for the company at every stage through her strong leadership and great attention to details. Under her leadership, GM—for the first time in its history—earned the strongest initial quality marks of all major automakers, also taking the top spot in eight vehicle segments. That’s big news, not only for the venerable car giant, but for the U.S. economy overall.

For Davis, earning high marks is a personal principal she applies to every area of her life. She recently spoke to EBONY.com about her exciting new role at GM and her advice for moving up the ladder in corporate America.    

EBONY: What is your job and describe your overall role at GM? 

Alicia Boler-Davis: I am the senior vice president of global quality and global customer experience for General Motors, which means I am responsible for leading the development and the execution of GM’s strategy to be a recognized leader in product quality and services in our quest to create to create lifelong customers. My teams make sure that our product quality exceeds our customer expectations relative to performance, reliability and durability of their ownership cycle.

	We are very customer-centric and place a premium on creating and maintaining positive relationships with our customers. That relationship starts from the very beginning with our product development and on through, where the customer is actually interfacing with our vehicles, the buy and entire ownership. We take very seriously our ability to provide accessible, knowledgeable and transparent relationship to our customers because we want them to have confidence and loyalty to our brands.

EBONY: Why did you pick a career in the automotive industry?

ABD: Growing up I was very good at math and science, and I always had an interest in tweaking and fixing things. I decided to study Engineering in college, and having grown up in Detroit, the auto industry was everywhere. I was always very passionate about cars, and so when the opportunity came to join GM, I jumped on it. I thought it was ideal, and I knew it was a company where I would have the opportunity to do a lot of different things.   

EBONY: What distinctive qualities do you bring to your job?

ABD: I have a very diverse background that includes work in manufacturing, product development, planning. And for the past year and a half, I’ve had an opportunity to work really closely with our sales and marketing organization, which is something very important. I also have a proven track record for driving change and obtaining results and leading a team effectively. 

	Personally, I truly have a passion for our customers. Our customers are the reason that we exist, and we really need to stay our focused on that, and I’m very passionate about that. Growing up, I liked to fix things and solving problems. I welcome challenges and look at that as a way for us to get better. I enjoy people and leading a team to come up with our strategy and executing it.  

EBONY: Are there any obstacles that you’ve had to overcome to achieve success in your career?

ABD: As I entered the automotive industry, I was aware that it was very male dominate and without a lot of diversity, especially in technical roles. However, even though I didn’t have a lot of role models who looked like me when I entered this industry, I was very fortunate to work with people who saw that I was dedicated and capable and competent, and so a lot of those biases went away. 

	I’ve been very fortunate, because GM is a company very committed to diversity, and we have a number of women and minorities in leadership positions here. The company has a track record of creating the environment and opportunity and the really deliverable results that have helped over time changed the perception, as well as the environment.

Alicia Boler-Davis has benchmarked GM's customer standards against companies known for quality service such as Apple, Amazon and Zappos.

DETROIT -- Twenty months ago, Alicia Boler-Davis was an assembly plant manager at General Motors. Today, the 44-year-old is one of the company's top 20 executives, reporting straight to CEO Dan Akerson. As senior vice president for global quality and customer experience, she oversees 2,500 employees and has a voice on everything from future products to the setup of GM's call centers. Her rapid ascent says as much about GM's game plan for success as it does about the fastidious engineer and Detroit native. Vehicle quality and customer care are key fronts on which GM is fighting to shed the baggage of its 2009 bankruptcy and to reclaim customers who long ago abandoned the automaker. "We've got one chance to get people back into our cars and trucks and treat them right and retain them and grow market share," GM North America President Mark Reuss said in a recent interview. "I wanted someone with passion and a different set of eyes to look at how we create a customer experience that sets us apart." By the time Reuss called on Boler-Davis, in early 2012, she had impressed her bosses by pulling off double duty as the vehicle chief engineer for the Chevrolet Sonic while she was manager of the Orion Township assembly plant in suburban Detroit where the car is built. It was a high-profile launch: GM overhauled its operations and labor agreement to contain costs in a bid to turn a profit assembling the Sonic, the only U.S.-built subcompact.


Reuss: "She tells it like it is."


Boler-Davis was an unconventional pick for customer experience chief. She had spent most of her 17-year career inside GM's factories, far from the front lines of dealership showrooms. But when approached by Reuss and GM product chief Mary Barra, she was intrigued by the scope of the job. "Mark said, 'We want to be recognized as the leaders in customer experience within two years. Go make it happen." Boler-Davis says. "My reaction was: 'You're going to unleash me to do that? Great.'" The selection meshed with GM's unusual approach of combining customer experience and quality into one organization. The idea is to speed customer feedback from the retail front directly back to design and engineering. For example, a Cadillac XTS owner phoned a customer call center last year to complain that her book on CD was muted but kept playing when she received an incoming call via Bluetooth. The complaint was routed to GM engineering, and a fix was done within three months. GM executives believe those small victories eventually will help build market share, which was 18.0 percent this year through September, down from 19.9 percent at the end of 2009. Boler-Davis said last year that GM's customer retention is average, which she defined as around 53 percent of owners who stick with a company for their next purchase. Adding just one percentage point to that rate would boost GM's vehicle sales by 25,000 units annually, or $750 million in revenue, she says.




				Big footprint
			

				GM's 300-employee customer experience group oversees these functions that overlap with some big and historically territorial departments.• Sales: Develops standards and reward guidelines for dealerships• Marketing: Compiles customer feedback on trim and option packages• Design: Recommends design tweaks based on customer complaints• Engineering: Flags customer gripes that may have an engineering fix, such as an infotainment bug
			


GM stunned many industry insiders in June when it became the first Detroit automaker to finish atop the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study in the survey's 27-year history. Another J.D. Power survey that measures customer satisfaction with dealership service ranked Cadillac the No. 2 luxury brand and Buick, GMC and Chevrolet in the top five among mainstream brands. Akerson was so pleased with the quality result that in June he made Boler-Davis a direct report and gave her job global reach. He also put her on GM's inner-circle Executive Operations Committee, a group of about 20 key execs from around the globe who meet regularly to hash over major strategic decisions. "She's a spark plug. She's got ideas. She's a force," Akerson said of Boler-Davis last month. Her promotion also shows how eager Akerson, Reuss and other GM brass are to dismantle the persistent parochial divisions that have long splintered GM's corporate structure. Boler-Davis' 300-employee customer experience group (she oversees 2,200 on the quality side) was given a broad mandate to make changes that overlap with some big and historically territorial enterprises, such as sales, marketing, design and engineering. While GM has periodically assigned executives to such cross-departmental, troubleshooting roles, none was given the global reach and direct authority to effect changes that Boler-Davis has. Last year, her team helped develop a program that required Chevrolet dealers to attend a three-day training jaunt to a Walt Disney theme park, or risk falling out of compliance with GM's brand-image program. Her group has pushed more mystery shopping of GM dealerships and required enrollees in the company's dealer-excellence program to adopt reputation-management systems. There has been pushback among some dealers and field staff, she acknowledges. "I've had people look at me like: 'OK, who are you and why are you telling me I need to do things differently?'" she says. She sought to convince skeptics that the customer experience push wasn't a flavor-of-the-month program but a long-term strategy that would win over more customers. "We already had so many things going well: great products, a very engaged dealer body, a seasoned sales force," Boler-Davis says. "The question becomes: How do we take that to the next level and separate ourselves from what everyone else is doing?" Early in Boler-Davis' tenure as customer experience chief, GM hired an outside research firm to survey customers inside and outside the auto industry. It benchmarked GM's customer service standards against companies "known for delivering a great experience," such as Apple, Amazon.com and online shoe retailer Zappos, she said. That process resulted in several measures that Boler-Davis' team has since put in place: GM hired around 50 so-called connected customer specialists from companies such as Apple and Best Buy as on-call specialists stationed around the country to troubleshoot infotainment problems for dealerships and customers. GM took over management of its previously outsourced customer call centers, in Austin, Texas, and suburban Detroit. "We're putting the customer that much closer to the people who are designing and engineering the products and solving the problems," Boler-Davis says.She says the average time it takes for a dealer to resolve a customer's problem has been cut in half over the past year. (She said that it's measured in days but won't specify a number for competitive reasons.) GM is dispatching around 90 lead engineers through six-week rotations at GM dealerships to get familiar with the retail side of the business. A key finding: Customers find the myriad trim and option packages across GM's models too complex. So GM is setting stricter thresholds for take rates on certain trim levels and packages. Those in low demand will be removed from next-generation products. Within the past year, GM has expanded its vehicle reliability testing. Depending on the launch, engineers test 20 to 100 vehicles across the country, from thin mountain air to baking desert heat, as a supplement to the durability testing GM has long done at its test track in Milford, Mich.

Tom Libby, head of North American forecasting for R.L. Polk & Co., says that GM has long suffered from subpar quality, but that it is starting to turn the corner with its recent wins in the J.D. Power surveys and Consumer Reports reviews. Boler-Davis will be under pressure to repeat the initial quality performance next year, given GM's busy slate of vehicle launches, Libby says. "If they can keep this up, there's little doubt that it will translate into improved market share and loyalty," he says. People who have worked for Boler-Davis describe her as hands-on and assertive but approachable. At the Orion Township plant, Boler-Davis was unusually visible on the plant floor, says Evelyn Baldwin, a team leader in the plant's paint shop. "Seeing her on the floor and communicating to them and knowing them by their name, that was very important for the workers," Baldwin says. Reuss says Boler-Davis' candor about GM's shortcomings helped her land the job. He describes her as "unemotional but very passionate." "She tells it like it is," Reuss says. "For years I've listened to VPs of quality who would tally and measure our vehicle quality, but wouldn't affect it. She is affecting it by getting at the reality and transparency of where we are and what we need to do." Boler-Davis, the mother of two young boys, applies that same problem-solving approach and candor at home. Her older son recently started middle school and, for the first time, has been getting assignments from multiple teachers. Some use e-mail to assign homework. Others might have a Web site or blog. Boler-Davis finds the patchwork frustrating. "There needs to be a standard," she says of the assignment process. "I can't wait for parent-teacher conferences."

                    From managing a Cadillac Escalade plant in Texas to heading up global manufacturing and labor relations, Alicia Boler Davis has skyrocketed into the top ranks of General Motors’ leadership.by Shiraz AhmedImagine you’ve just bought a new truck — a Chevy Tahoe, perhaps. You drive it off the dealership lot, get on the highway to head home and realize that something isn’t working as expected.
You press a little blue button with a white star on the rearview mirror, and a voice says, “Thank you for calling OnStar.”
This is General Motors’ OnStar, the concierge service that assists subscribers with things like navigation and roadside assistance. You chat with the OnStar representative about the problem; then, suddenly, the rep says, “There’s someone who wants to talk with you.” A new voice chimes in.
“Hi, I’m Alicia Boler Davis. I’m a senior vice president here at General Motors, and I just want you to know I’m listening and we’re going to look into this.”
“It’s a bit of a ‘wow’ and a delight for our customers,” recalls Christine Sitek, a colleague of Boler Davis who has witnessed some of these moments. “She always wants to speak and engage directly with the customer.”
Interrupting customer service calls to dazzle strangers isn’t what Boler Davis ’91 imagined she’d be doing when she started at GM. An engineer by training, she came up through the carmaker’s hulking plants and says the factory floor still feels like home.
“I think a big part is the people,” she explains, “being able to interact with people, being able to bring people together for a common goal.”
It’s being a unifier — and a quick study — that has helped Boler Davis skyrocket into the ranks of GM’s top leadership.
In 2009 GM was facing bankruptcy and had one objective: “survival,” says Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Since then GM has enjoyed a resurgence that was unthinkable during the depths of the crisis. Today the company has achieved record-breaking sales and won respected awards for vehicle quality. Its leaders have also transformed themselves, says Cole. “The reign of the king-leader is gone. The leader is more like a coach.”
By this, he means that the once-dictatorial executives who crashed the industry have been replaced with consensus-building, team-focused leaders.
And according to those she’s led, Boler Davis is a terrific coach.
Jim Moloney, a colleague from customer experience, would come into Boler Davis’ office “feeling very frustrated — [with] the enormity of driving big change at a company like GM.” He’d sit down with her, and “in the course of a conversation, almost without effort, I’d walk out afterward feeling very good about myself. My batteries had been recharged.”
Boler Davis’ accomplishments back up her reputation. She was the carmaker’s first African American woman plant manager, led the engineering and build of a critical vehicle in its lineup and, as the vice president of customer experience and quality, helped transform the fundamental character of a company striving for change.
Today Boler Davis is GM’s executive vice president of global manufacturing and labor relations. She leads about 180,000 employees at 171 facilities that pump out tens of thousands of cars, trucks and SUVs every day. As Sitek says, it’s the job Boler Davis “was meant to have.”
“Alicia’s strong manufacturing background, combined with her recent roles leading quality and the customer experience, will allow us to create an even stronger customer-focused link among our people and processes in GM’s manufacturing operations worldwide,” says Mary Barra, GM chairman and CEO.
The plants are the final stop for GM before vehicles are shipped off to car dealerships and customers around the world. It is imperative for Boler Davis that manufacturing employees are fully engaged in delivering vehicles of the highest quality. In her role as chief of labor relations, she is looking to all unions representing hourly workers around the world as partners in driving employee engagement — no mean feat with 45 different unions representing hourly workers in 31 countries.

She’s the woman for the job. Friends and colleagues say that her empathy allows her to connect with workers on a personal level.
“Alicia’s got an incredible ability to be on the floor and talk with people who are building our vehicles, know what our issues are and genuinely relate well to the employees,” says Moloney. “She’s at ease on the floor, and she’s at ease in the corporate boardroom.”
On the factory floor, there is a constant drive to hit the day’s quotas. Boler Davis loves this life because, at the end of the day, “you can see whether or not you’re winning.”
Competitive by nature, she speaks the language of sportscasters, explains Moloney. “You don’t actually win the game unless you score some goals,” he says. “Lots of times in big organizations, you see individuals go up and down the field, but they never score any points.” Boler Davis, he says, is somebody who scores points.
Boler Davis was born in Detroit and raised in Romulus, a working-class suburb away from the bustle of the city. Her parents divorced early, leaving her and her three siblings to be reared by a working mom.
Even early in life she had a fascination with how things work. In middle school, when appliances broke — the iron, the coffee maker — and the family couldn’t afford to replace them, she would pull them apart and figure out what was wrong. “I was the one who would fix things,” she says.
In high school she participated in a summer engineering program run by General Motors Institute, now known as Kettering University. She took classes in calculus and chemistry and toured labs and offices. It may have only been a few weeks, but, Boler Davis says, “I like to tell people that General Motors really got me started in my career.”
It also gave her a first glimpse of the massive factories that are emblematic of this corner of the country. She walked down the assembly lines she would one day be in charge of, in awe of the sheer size and breadth of the carmaker.
She thought, “They make things here. I like that.”
On the Right Track at Northwestern
At Northwestern, Boler Davis fell in love with engineering.
“Northwestern really gave me the confidence that I had strong engineering skills,” she explains.
But when she applied to the University, her confidence wasn’t guaranteed. She didn’t know anyone from her high school who had attended Northwestern, and she hadn’t even visited the campus before applying. The school was an unknown.
After getting accepted, she enrolled in Northwestern’s Minority Engineering Opportunity Program (now called EXCEL), a McCormick School of Engineering summer program that helps incoming first-year students make the transition to college.
Over the course of five weeks, groups of 15 to 20 take classes together in math, chemistry and leadership; live in dorms; and learn key skills such as asking for help, working in groups to succeed and, for students who come from insular communities, adapting to a new social setting.
Boler Davis thrived in the program and later as a McCormick chemical engineering student. Through MEOP she was introduced to the Northwestern chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, a close-knit, preprofessional organization she eventually rose up to lead as a senior.
“It was almost akin to a sorority,” says Rhonda Smith Ferguson ’91, a fellow NSBE member who has known Boler Davis since they were first-year students. “It was about helping each other.”
When they weren’t planning events or networking, Boler Davis and Ferguson would hop on the “L” and explore Chicago. “Basically window-shop,” jokes Ferguson.
Of course, they studied as well. Her time in school, Boler Davis says, instilled in her a belief that she “can learn anything.”
“Northwestern helped foster in me the idea of doing things that you may not think are possible,” she says. “I remember when I chose to study chemical engineering, I chose that because it was challenging.”
This belief is what led her, shortly after graduating from Northwestern, to make the switch from chemical engineering to mechanical engineering and then take a job with an almost legendary company in her hometown.
Tooling Up
When Bill Boggs, a veteran plant manager, joined GM after years in the auto industry, he had one request. “I want your hardest plant. That way I can show you what I can do.”
Boggs was placed at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility, back then a rough-and-tumble factory plagued by quality and leadership issues. There he met Boler Davis, who was 30 years old and coordinating vehicle launches at the time.
He often sought out young talent to mentor, and Boler Davis proved herself more than capable.
“Back when I grew up, there weren’t any women at all in manufacturing,” Boggs says. “So when I found someone who was passionate about it and wanted to stay in, I’d always try to help her.”
Under his guidance, Boler Davis trained in each major sector of the manufacturing plant. “We loaded up her toolbox, if you will — put her in all the positions,” Boggs says. “She’s like a sponge. She just ate it up.” (Boggs mentions that by the time he retired, he was working for her.)
Much sooner than she expected, Boler Davis was named a plant manager and dispatched to Arlington, Texas.
 
 The assembly line at the General Motors plant in Arlington, Texas, where Alicia Boler Davis was plant manager from 2007 to 2009. She was the first African American woman to become a GM plant manager. Mike Stone for General Motors.
The Arlington facility is one of GM’s most important factories. The Cadillac Escalade, arguably very important to GM’s luxury brand, is built in Arlington, among other vehicles. For a first crack at running a plant, this was not one to screw up.
The challenges went beyond the operation. Boler Davis was the first African American woman to lead a GM plant. She was only 38 years old, leading a plant staffed by veteran workers who were suspicious of outsiders.
“I had people who were not happy to see me there,” she recalls. “People made comments about my age, my gender, my race — and not just little remarks.”
She sought advice from a retired executive, another woman, who told her: “Alicia, don’t worry about all that. Be yourself. Kill them with kindness.”
Boler Davis replied, incredulously, “Kill them with kindness? I don’t know if that’s going to work.”
But that’s what she did. Every day Boler Davis would march into work and do the best job she could. “Once people see that you’re confident, that you’re committed, that you’re going to be in the game,” she says, “that other stuff goes away very quickly.”
Within six months, she felt at home.
A Champion for Customers
In 2010, after returning to Michigan, Boler Davis was quickly assigned to apply her skills to engineering, building and launching the Chevrolet Sonic, a crucial new vehicle in GM’s post-bankruptcy lineup. At the end of that project, she had impressed the leadership so much that she was plucked out of the plants and asked to lead a new but critical department: customer experience.
When Boler Davis starts something new, she gets an “uncomfortable feeling.”
“It’s almost a paranoia, when you don’t want to fail,” she explains. “It pushes you to work harder, to really perform at a high level.”
This change was particularly abrupt. The customer experience function — a term broad enough to encompass all interactions with customers, from social media to the service bay — was formed by then-GM CEO Dan Akerson. As a newly minted vice president, Boler Davis transitioned from the blue-collar assembly lines of the factories to the white-collar phone lines of call centers.
There wasn’t any time to be nervous. In her first few days, Moloney recalls, Boler Davis received a phone call from CEO Akerson, who had heard from an irate customer. She responded that she looked forward to handling those calls in the future, and Moloney remembers Akerson’s reply: “You’re in the job right now. I want you to call this customer back this afternoon.”
Luckily, Boler Davis learns quickly.
“When she came into the contact center space, she didn’t know anything about how a center operated,” Moloney says. “She jumped right in, listened to calls, did meetings with advisers, took the time to understand what their issues were.”
GM is a vast, sprawling company. Boler Davis was tasked with being a champion for customers, breaking down bureaucratic barriers so that their voices were heard throughout the company.
The job had both practical and high-minded dimensions. The former required Boler Davis to modernize GM’s customer service infrastructure. She updated the call centers and the websites, turned the focus global rather than just domestic and wrangled with other GM departments to centralize the company’s social media efforts. Eventually, global product quality was added to her purview so that customer comments and complaints could feed directly to designers and engineers.
In late 2014 Boler Davis was named senior vice president of global connected customer experience. She led the company’s connected customer activities, including infotainment, OnStar and GM’s Urban Active personal mobility initiatives.
But those are just the nuts and bolts of the job. Ultimately, Boler Davis viewed her role as fundamentally transforming how GM and its employees see themselves. She sought to make it so that every decision every employee made was determined by how the end result would affect the customer.
“It was simply understanding the impact of your decisions on the customer, bringing the customer’s voice into your decision-making process,” says Boler Davis. “Our employees wanted to have this reason for being that was beyond we’re here to design and engineer and build cars.”
She told employees, “We’re here to meet the needs of our customers; we’re here to exceed their expectations; we’re here to find creative solutions to their problems.”
“That was not an easy ask of our company,” says Moloney. “Back to our roots in manufacturing, we’ve always been resource rich, but that doesn’t make you customer focused.”
He says Boler Davis took the fight to the very highest levels of GM. “If I look at our [company] purpose and value statements, I can see Alicia’s fingerprints all over it.”
It was a “total surprise” when GM CEO Barra asked Boler Davis to return to manufacturing last June.
“I had spent 18 years in manufacturing,” she explains. “I had a great career there, but I was doing something different in the company in customer experience and connectivity, and I was OK with that.”
Halfway through Barra’s conversation with her, however, Boler Davis interrupted and said, “I’ll do it.”
As head of global manufacturing and labor relations, Boler Davis is in charge of making sure that the almost 10 million cars, trucks and SUVs that GM manufactures around the world annually are built to schedule and top quality when they come off the assembly line.
“Being back in manufacturing,” she says, “it feels like home to me.”
Leading by Example
Her family is where she finds peace. “It’s where I can go back and be very grounded,” says Boler Davis, who is married and has a 24-year-old stepdaughter and two sons, ages 14 and 11. She coached one son’s fifth-grade robotics team, and they went on to compete internationally. It pays to have an engineer for a mom.
She volunteers and serves on the boards of several organizations aimed at assisting inner-city and underprivileged youth. Her message is simple, yet speaks to her journey: You can do it, because I have done it.
“I also come from a home where I didn’t have two parents, where my mom worked all the time, where we didn’t have a lot,” she often tells kids. “In spite of that, you can still dream. In spite of that, you can still be successful.”
Boler Davis shares a story of a teenage girl she met while volunteering at a high school in Detroit. When they met, one detail about the girl stood out. “Those tattoos, my gosh!” Boler Davis thought. “What the heck?”
The heavily tattooed girl and she were side by side, cleaning graffiti off of lockers. Boler Davis asked the girl, a high school junior, if she was looking forward to her senior year. She responded, “Yeah, I am, but I gotta figure out where I’m going to live.”
She then told Boler Davis of her struggles: how she had lived with four different family members and friends in one year; how she hadn’t seen her mother in months; how she was thinking about college but really wanted to join the U.S. Air Force.
“I was encouraging her,” Boler Davis says, “that she could do it.”
And then the girl told her about how the tattoos — permanent reminders of decisions she had made at a younger age — violated U.S. Air Force protocols for admission.
They kept talking, and all Boler Davis kept hearing was can’t. “She was giving me more reasons why she could not, even though she had this strong passion.”
Then, true to her nature, Boler Davis became a problem solver. “We talked about what her options were. What was the most visible tattoo? What can we do about it?”
Eventually they finished cleaning, hugged and said goodbye. Years later, Boler Davis says, she learned that the girl had not joined the U.S. Air Force but did make it into a four-year university.
This story may sound a little too perfect, but take away the context of the conversation and Boler Davis could have behaved the same way on a plant floor, in a call center or in GM’s boardroom. Those she works with say Boler Davis has an incredible ability to instruct, empathize and inspire all at once.
“Great leaders — you feel like you’re working with them, not for them,” says Moloney. He recalls a meeting with her early on in the process of updating the contact centers. Boler Davis wanted to make sure they weren’t settling for “good enough.” “She said, ‘Jim, I’m going to push you to the ledge. I just don’t want you to jump off.’ ”
It might be that Boler Davis expects of others what she demands of herself: fearlessness. Near the beginning of her time at GM, before she entered the plants and met Bill Boggs, Boler Davis had a choice. She could move to manufacturing and learn how a car is built, as she wanted, or move to vehicle design and engineering as her supervisor recommended.
After all, plants are rough places.
“I was just persistent,” recalls Boler Davis. “And I said, ‘Hey, do you mind if I talk to your manager about it?’ ” She debated and pushed her supervisor, and eventually he came around with an even better offer: Go to a plant, but then, after a year and a half or two years, have an option to move elsewhere.
From there, Boler Davis was set.
“I had nothing to lose.”

McCormickFall 2013 MagazineData as ArtAlumni Profile: Alicia Boler-DavisTraveling the world to help General Motors exceed expectations::As senior vice president of global quality and global customer experience for General Motors, Alicia Boler-Davis (’91) travels the world to ensure excitement and reliability each time customers step inside their vehicles. 
Back in the late 1980s, however, Boler-Davis was a typical undergraduate, undecided about her future and overwhelmed by classwork. She loved chemistry, but an internship at a chemical company convinced her that she wouldn’t be satisfied working alone in a lab. She was challenged by the difficult chemical engineering curriculum and by juggling a full course load with a part-time job. Tough it out, she told herself—a mantra that also helped her rise in a male-dominated industry and pioneer a more customer-focused culture in a century-old company. 
“Throughout my career I have always gone back to the memory of when I was in school and found ways to overcome challenges, when I had setbacks and persevered,” she says. “You have the greatest opportunity to contribute when you stretch yourself.” 
It helped that Boler-Davis was always focused: she knew she wanted to be an engineer from an early age. Growing up in Michigan, she excelled in math and science. In high school she participated in a six-week engineering program at what was then the General Motors Institute, taking college-level courses, visiting plants and laboratories, and picturing herself as an engineer. 
Boler-Davis chose Northwestern because of its location and its reputation with minorities in engineering. She participated in the program that eventually became EXCEL, where students interested in minority issues come to campus the summer before freshman year to get a head start. 
“I built relationships from the moment I stepped on campus,” she says. She chose to major in chemical engineering and met several alumni who were successful in research and development and in sales. “I loved that you could do many things with a chemical engineering degree, because I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to do,” she says. “And I loved organic chemistry”—a comment rarely heard in the halls of Tech. 
In her free time Boler-Davis could be found at the beach with friends, cheering at Wildcat football games, and serving as chairwoman of the National Society of Black Engineers, an early chance to develop leadership skills. “I found you don’t just tell people what to do. You need to figure out how to get them to buy into what you’re trying to do,” she says. “That has helped me tremendously in the workplace. You don’t know you’re getting those tools in your toolbox until you have to use them, and then you find out you’re very well prepared.” 
Northwestern’s wide curriculum honed her whole-brain engineering skills with classes in sociology and African art. “My goal was always to be a balanced engineer who had strong technical skills but who also had great interpersonal skills,” she says. 
She joined General Motors as a manufacturing engineer in 1994 after spending a few years as an engineer for pharmaceutical and food companies, and she traveled the country to help with new tooling product launches. But in order to learn more about GM operations, she asked for an assignment in a plant—an unpopular choice for many engineers because of the demanding people-oriented work. 
After a year working on production and launch schedules, Boler-Davis became a plant production supervisor in charge of 50 employees. Approaching the job as an engineer, she created lists of daily duties but learned that in a plant where problems arose quickly and needed to be solved immediately, she needed a new approach. 
“I wasn’t just an engineer anymore. It was less about me and more about what I was able to get done with my team,” she says. “I had to be an effective leader to communicate what needed to happen each day.” 
Boler-Davis found she was good at being a plant supervisor—she liked the people, the pace, the challenges—and by putting in long hours and making data-driven decisions she continued moving up the ranks until she became the first African American female plant manager in 2007. 
“When I was moving up at GM, there were very few female plant managers,” she says. “There were no African American females at all in leadership roles. Some people had the reaction, ‘Wow, you’re a woman and you’re black; what can you do?’ But once they get over that initial reaction, they judge you on your capabilities. People knew I delivered results and did it by engaging the team.” Several more women have since followed Boler-Davis into leadership roles at GM. 
In her current role Boler-Davis travels the world to examine customers’ every touch point with GM to ensure the company is exceeding expectations. Her role combines product design and development with the consumer experience of the product, which has helped her improve GM’s customer awareness. “I see the full value chain from concept to production to ownership to when the customer is back in the market for another vehicle,” she says. “It is huge to see that and be able to affect our next products.” Boler-Davis has observed a “transformation” among GM employees, who are now “passionate around delivering great products and experience for our customers.” The redesigned Chevrolet Impala earned Consumer Reports’ highest score among sedans, a rare feat for an American car. 
When she’s not working, Boler-Davis spends time with her husband and two sons, volunteering in the community, and traveling, including visits to Evanston for Homecoming. 
Her success motivates her to keep moving forward. Her next goal is to help refine GM’s global strategy before implementation. 
“I’m excited to have this opportunity,” she says. “I have a lot to do.” ::By: Emily AyshfordRelated ContentLearn more about Alicia Boler-Davis' role at General Motors
