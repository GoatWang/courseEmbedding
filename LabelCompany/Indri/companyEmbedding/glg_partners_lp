Tequila Sunrise: Good news for the Mexican Peso


The Mexican Peso could currently make a good claim to be one of the most unloved assets in the world, with speculative shorts close to record highs. Here we discuss some structural reasons why the selloff might be overdone.

Emerging Markets Debt - 2016 Review and Outlook


The Mexican peso has become somewhat unloved since the U.S. presidential elections, as testified by net speculative short positioning and price action of the currency.

Investment Approach | Man GLG



















































We have a variety of styles under one roof which allows us to attract a broad range of highly talented people.

                                    Teun Johnston, CEO of Man GLG                                


























Seeking Superior Performance











Our approach is based around developing the best investment talent within a collaborative environment. Our fund managers are unconstrained by any house view. We believe this ‘autonomous collaboration’ and open sharing of ideas is the core of our culture and competitive advantage. It results in a diverse range of expert opinion coupled with independent investment ideas.
Technology tools and our trading floor environment put investment teams in constant contact with each other and encourage teams to share insights with each other. We believe this improves the quality of each and every team’s decisions and enhances our clients’ returns. 




















Safeguarding our client's interests













Institutional Infrastructure


Man GLG benefits from Man Group’s robust infrastructure, financial stability and centralised support functions. This allows our investment professionals to concentrate on their strengths, namely investment management and research, supported by the strong, comprehensive and centralised infrastructure of Man Group.
Given our focus on recruiting and developing leading industry talent, it is important that our managers have a highly robust and advanced platform on which to trade. As such, we have developed proprietary IT and trading platforms, designed to allow our managers to fully express their investment convictions in a highly efficient and timely manner.


​


 

Responsible Investing





Man GLG
Man GLG is a signatory of the UN Principles of Responsible Investment and is an experienced manager of sustainability focused investment strategies. By leveraging the experience gained from managing dedicated sustainability mandates, a number of Man GLG disciplines are attaining and aspiring to higher ESG standards.
​Download Our Responsible Investment Policy (PDF)
 







Man Group
The Hedge Fund Standards were drawn up in 2007 to address key issues relating to the hedge fund industry and best practice, covering the areas of disclosure, valuation, risk management, fund governance and shareholder conduct. Man is a founding signatory of the Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) which was fully established in 2008 as a guardian to the Standards with the goal of creating a framework for promoting integrity, transparency and good governance in the industry.


 

Compliance and Control
We employ a "Three lines of defence" model to ensure our managers have the flexibility to trade effectively but within an appropriately controlled environment. This creates clear accountability and oversight, mitigation of risks and seeks to ensure that we manage our clients’ assets in a safe and secure environment.
More broadly, and something we consider central to our business, a culture of compliance is something we instil into all personnel. We are committed to running the business to the highest standards, and for the long term.

Client Service and Support


We have deep relationships with a diverse range of global clients, ranging from large institutional investors to financial intermediaries.
Importantly, our clients have a dedicated relationship manager who assists them through every step of the investment process and provides ongoing support thereafter.
We pride ourselves on providing our clients with both outstanding levels of transparency and additional insights through our thought leadership, webcasts and tailored risk reporting.


​


 

Risk Management
Effective risk management is central to our business. We are stewards of our clients’ capital and invest in the systems, people and controls to help ensure we take measured risks. As part of our risk controls, Man GLG has a dedicated Risk Committee that is responsible for setting internal risk limits, advising on risk development and enhancements, and considering firm-wide risks. The Risk Management team is independent of Man GLG and reports to the Chief Risk Officer for Man.


​


The Risk Management team is responsible for the infrastructure that monitors and controls relevant risks, and to ensure that risk issues are investigated and resolved in a timely manner. In addition to regulatory and mandate limits we monitor each strategy to ensure it remains within appropriate internal risk limits. The Compliance team will actively monitor each portfolio against pre-set constraints to detect any breaches of limits on a pre- or post-trade basis.
While we believe independent risk and compliance functions are critical for robust oversight of each portfolio we also instil a culture of risk management and compliance in each investment team and across the firm. Many of our investment strategies have additional risk management professionals in addition to the independent risk team.

Man GLG (formerly GLG Partners) is a discretionary investment manager and a wholly owned subsidiary of British alternative investment manager Man Group plc. It is a diversified and multi-strategy fund manager that operates strategies including equity long-short funds, convertible arbitrage funds, emerging market funds and long-only mutual funds.[2] The firm is also a founding member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board and a signatory of the Principles for Responsible investment. As of June 2015, Man GLG had $33.3bn assets under management.

History[edit]
GLG was founded in 1995 by Noam Gottesman, Pierre LaGrange and Jonathan Green, as a unit of Lehman Brothers. The three founders met while working in Goldman Sachs' private client business in the 1980s.
GLG was spun off by Lehman in 2000 before going public in 2007 through a reverse merger with Freedom Acquisition Holdings. At the time of the merger, GLG Partners Inc was valued at £3.3 billion, the then-largest alternative investment manager in Europe.[3][4] In April 2009, GLG Partners acquired Société Générale Asset Management UK, adding $8.2bn in AUM and increasing GLG's exposure to the UK retail market.[5][6][7]
Man Group plc acquired GLG Partners in May 2010, paying $1.6 billion ($4.50 per share) in cash and new shares. The merger was the largest acquisition in hedge fund industry[8][9] The acquisition was finalised on 14 October 2010.
In 2015 Man GLG acquired Silvermine Capital Management, a US-based investment advisor, as well as NewSmith LLP, an equity investment manager. Man GLG reportedly paid an initial $23.5m for Silvermine; the acquisition was said by Hedgeweek to provide Man GLG with more expertise in US credit markets and expand the firm’s North American presence. The Telegraph noted that the NewSmith acquisition would extend Man GLG's presence in the Japanese market.[10][11][12]
In December 2013, Man GLG settled charges brought by the SEC after a failure of the firm's internal controls caused it to overvalue its stake in a coal mining company.[13][14] GLG did not admit or deny the charges.[15] In January 2014 the billionaire investor Richard Desmond sued GLG and Credit Suisse over losses stemming from investments that Desmond stated were "too complex to understand".[16] GLG denied advising Desmond on the transaction; the firm also argued that Desmond was in fact a sophisticated investor, having invested over $15m with GLG since 1998.[17] The case was settled out of court in 2015.[18]
Structure and operations[edit]
Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager, utilising absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The firm has headquarters in London, with offices in New York, Hong Kong and Pfäffikon.
Man Group's 2014 trading statement reported that Man GLG had had a “mixed” year, but that the January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine would boost the division’s US CLO business.
Man Group acquired GLG Partners partly to diversify its business towards more institutional clients. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Manny Roman (former co-CEO at GLG and Man Group) said: "When GLG was acquired by Man Group, there was a clear shift in strategy, under new leadership, in terms of what we wanted to achieve and what we wanted to do. We wanted the company to service institutional clients and be very much focused on that market".[citation needed]

The Mexican Peso could currently make a good claim to be one of the most unloved assets in the world, with speculative shorts close to record highs. Here we discuss some structural reasons why the selloff might be overdone.

Emerging Markets Debt - 2016 Review and Outlook


The Mexican peso has become somewhat unloved since the U.S. presidential elections, as testified by net speculative short positioning and price action of the currency.

History[edit]
GLG was founded in 1995 by Noam Gottesman, Pierre LaGrange and Jonathan Green, as a unit of Lehman Brothers. The three founders met while working in Goldman Sachs' private client business in the 1980s.
GLG was spun off by Lehman in 2000 before going public in 2007 through a reverse merger with Freedom Acquisition Holdings. At the time of the merger, GLG Partners Inc was valued at £3.3 billion, the then-largest alternative investment manager in Europe.[3][4] In April 2009, GLG Partners acquired Société Générale Asset Management UK, adding $8.2bn in AUM and increasing GLG's exposure to the UK retail market.[5][6][7]
Man Group plc acquired GLG Partners in May 2010, paying $1.6 billion ($4.50 per share) in cash and new shares. The merger was the largest acquisition in hedge fund industry[8][9] The acquisition was finalised on 14 October 2010.
In 2015 Man GLG acquired Silvermine Capital Management, a US-based investment advisor, as well as NewSmith LLP, an equity investment manager. Man GLG reportedly paid an initial $23.5m for Silvermine; the acquisition was said by Hedgeweek to provide Man GLG with more expertise in US credit markets and expand the firm’s North American presence. The Telegraph noted that the NewSmith acquisition would extend Man GLG's presence in the Japanese market.[10][11][12]
In December 2013, Man GLG settled charges brought by the SEC after a failure of the firm's internal controls caused it to overvalue its stake in a coal mining company.[13][14] GLG did not admit or deny the charges.[15] In January 2014 the billionaire investor Richard Desmond sued GLG and Credit Suisse over losses stemming from investments that Desmond stated were "too complex to understand".[16] GLG denied advising Desmond on the transaction; the firm also argued that Desmond was in fact a sophisticated investor, having invested over $15m with GLG since 1998.[17] The case was settled out of court in 2015.[18]
Structure and operations[edit]
Man GLG is a multi-team discretionary investment manager, utilising absolute return and long-only strategies across asset classes, sectors and geographies. The firm has headquarters in London, with offices in New York, Hong Kong and Pfäffikon.
Man Group's 2014 trading statement reported that Man GLG had had a “mixed” year, but that the January 2015 acquisition of Silvermine would boost the division’s US CLO business.
Man Group acquired GLG Partners partly to diversify its business towards more institutional clients. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Manny Roman (former co-CEO at GLG and Man Group) said: "When GLG was acquired by Man Group, there was a clear shift in strategy, under new leadership, in terms of what we wanted to achieve and what we wanted to do. We wanted the company to service institutional clients and be very much focused on that market".[citation needed]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
