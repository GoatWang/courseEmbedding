Chief Exec Steps Down At Johnson Products - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Chief Exec Steps Down At Johnson ProductsMarch 10, 1992Johnson Products Co. chief Eric G. Johnson has abruptly left that company, apparently the latest victim of squabbling within its controlling family.The Chicago ethnic hair-care products company, known for such brands as Gentle Treatment and Ultra Sheen, disclosed Eric Johnson`s departure Monday, following weekend reports of his ouster in Crain`s Chicago Business.FOR THE RECORD - Additional material published March 11, 1992:Corrections and clarifications.In a March 10 story in the Business section on a management shakeup at Johnson Products Inc., it was stated incorrectly that Eric G. Johnson asked his two brothers, John and George Jr., to leave the company soon after he became chief executive in 1989. George Johnson Sr., whoresigned from the company in 1989, said George Jr. left the company to pursue a career in the music industry. George Sr. said he, not Eric, dismissed John from the firm, but declined to elaborate. George Jr. confirmed he chose to leave the company. Efforts to reach John forcomment were unsuccessful. The Tribune regrets the errors.Eric Johnson had been widely credited for a comeback in the company`s fortunes in recent years. With its earnings prospects good, the company in January paid its first dividend since 1980.On the American Stock Exchange, Johnson Products` shares closed Monday at $19.50, off 87 cents.In a statement, the company said Eric Johnson resigned as president, chief executive and a director ``to pursue personal business interests.``Efforts to reach him and other company officials for comment were unsuccessful.The company didn`t name a successor, but said it will form an ``office of the president`` to be filled by several key executives, none of whom was identified.Joan B. Johnson, 62, the company`s controlling stockholder and chairman as well as Eric`s mother, acknowledged the ``significant contribution`` made by her 40-year-old son.``I understand his decision and wish him well in the future,`` she said in the statement.Their relationship has displayed signs of strain in the last year.Last May, Eric Johnson submitted a proposal to the company`s board that contemplated his mother acquiring the nearly 40 percent of shares in public hands for $17.25 a share, or about $8 million. But his mother wouldn`t commit to the plan and he withdrew it two months later.His departure comes 4 1/2 months after he signed a new employment agreement that was to run until Oct. 28, 1994. Under that agreement, he could receive severance payments of up to two years of his base salary ($300,000)plus bonus.In 1972, Eric Johnson joined the company founded by his father, George, and his mother. Eric became president in 1988 and chief executive a year later, when his parents divorced and George Johnson resigned, turning over his shares to his ex-wife.Joan Johnson today controls through trusts 58.2 percent of the company stock. Other officers and directors control a combined 1.4 percent.Soon after becoming chief executive, Eric Johnson created turmoil within the family by asking his two brothers to leave the company, apparently because he was dissatisfied with their productivity.A shareholder suit, filed last year to block the proposed buyout, referred to the move against the brothers.It quoted Eric Johnson as saying, ``We`re not a social organization that has memberships. My main goal is to be operating a profitable business.``Crain`s quoted sources as saying Eric Johnson`s departure could allow his 27-year-old sister, Joan M. Johnson, to jump several rungs on the corporate ladder.The newspaper said she joined the company a year ago as director of market research.

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  3/15/2000 
 A native of Chicago, Illinois, Eric Johnson, who was born on March 29, 1951, grew up learning about the business world. As the son of groundbreaking entrepreneur George Johnson, founder of Johnson Hair Products, Eric Johnson was part of Chicago's black elite. Johnson got his first business experience working in his father’s hair product factory at the age of eight.
After graduating from Chicago's Laboratory School, Johnson attended Babson College in Boston before obtaining an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Johnson began his career in business at Procter & Gamble before joining the management team of his family's company. He then effectively used this experience when he took over management of Johnson Hair Products.
As president, he increased sales and Johnson's Hair Products stock was the seventh best-performing stock on the American Stock Exchange in 1991. Later, Johnson acquired Baldwin Ice Cream Company, which he merged with Richardson Foods to become Baldwin/Richardson Foods. In 2000, Baldwin/Richardson Foods' annual profits were around $62 million. The company is also one the largest African American owned businesses in the food industry. Johnson is active in civic activities and serves on numerous boards including the Boy Scouts of America, the Rochester Institute of Technology and Chicago State University. In 1998, Johnson was elected to the board of directors of Lincoln National Corporation.

Johnson Boss Drops Bid To Go Private - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Johnson Boss Drops Bid To Go PrivateJune 26, 1991|By Charles Storch.The president of Johnson Products Co. on Tuesday abandoned his proposal to take the firm private amid indications he lacked support from its controlling stockholder, his mother.Eric G. Johnson, 40, president and chief executive of the Chicago-based hair products firm, said in a statement he was withdrawing the $8 million proposal because he was unable to negotiate a transaction that would meet``the needs of all parties involved.``The company didn`t elaborate on his statement, but it is presumed one of those parties was Eric`s mother, Joan B. Johnson. She is the company`s chairwoman and controls 59.4 percent of its shares.Mrs. Johnson, 62, previously disclosed she supported ``in principle`` the idea of the company going private and had discussed the idea with her son. She said she favored any transaction that was fair to public shareholders and met her ``financial security requirements.``However, she also made it clear she wasn`t a member of her son`s buyout group and hadn`t decided whether to back the bid.In a statement Tuesday, Mrs. Johnson said only that she intends to remain the company`s majority stockholder. An attorney representing her declined to elaborate on her statement or her position on the buyout proposal.On May 28, Johnson Products disclosed that a group led by Eric Johnson proposed acquiring the 39 percent of Johnson Products stock in public hands for $17.25 a share, or about $8 million.The proposal called for Mrs. Johnson to own initially all of the company`s stock, but to reduce gradually her ownership interest ``to give senior management a substantial stake.``Eric Johnson said Tuesday: ``The proposed transaction required meeting the needs of all parties involved. However, the overriding objective has always been, and remains, enhancing the long-term viability of the company. We were unable to negotiate a transaction which would meet all of these goals.`` His statement came after the stock market`s close. On the American Stock Exchange, Johnson Products stock closed unchanged Tuesday at $14.50 a share.Johnson Products, one of the city`s most prominent minority-controlled companies, manufactures such hair-care products as Gentle-Treatment, Ultra Sheen, and Classy Curl.After several rocky years, the company`s financial performance has improved since Eric Johnson became chief executive in October 1989.In the fiscal year that ended last August, the company earned $2.1 million on sales of $33.5 million. For the first six months of fiscal 1991, it earned $1.2 million on sales of $16.3 million.A shareholder suit challenged the buyout bid. The suit was filed last month in Delaware, where the company is incorporated.

Get Help Now.WebsiteContact UsMore InfoDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassDid You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
