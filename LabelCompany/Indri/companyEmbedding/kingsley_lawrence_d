Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Lawrence D. Kingsley, Pall CEO, to get $109M golden parachute in company's sale

					 Pall Corp. chief executive Lawrence D. Kingsley is in line for a golden parachute worth more than $109.2 million, according to regulatory filings. Compensation experts say the raw number -- more than $2 million for each month Kingsley worked at Pall -- are influenced by the tripling of the company's stock price since he joined the Port Washington company in 2011.

Pall Corp. CEO Lawrence D. Kingsley, on the job less than four years, is in line for a golden parachute worth more than $109.2 million when Danaher Corp.'s $13.8 billion acquisition of the Port Washington filtration and purification company closes, according to regulatory filings.
The payout involves accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock following a change in ownership.

Compensation experts say the raw number -- more than $2 million for each month Kingsley worked at Pall -- are influenced by the tripling of Pall's stock price since Kingsley joined the Port Washington company in October 2011.
"The $100 million is a pretty big number," said Chris Crawford, president of Longnecker & Associates, a Houston compensation consultancy. But he pointed to the performance of Pall's stock as an indication that Kingsley's payout was justified.
Aaron Boyd, director of governance research at executive compensation research firm Equilar Inc., said a more conservative accounting of Kingsley's compensation related to the merger calculates it at $74.1 million, still "one of the bigger payouts for a CEO that we've seen over the last several years." That accounting measures cash but does not include stock and options vested as of June 1 or compensation programs available to other Pall employees.

Washington D.C.-based Danaher, which announced plans to split into two companies by the end of 2016, declined to respond to a request for comment. Pall, whose acquisition is expected to close by year's end, did not respond to a request for comment.

Pall shareholders must vote to approve the merger with Danaher but have only a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation related to the deal.
Boyd said executive compensation matters rarely present a hurdle for large deals.
On Kingsley's first day as CEO, Pall's stock closed at $41, according to Nasdaq.com. On Tuesday the stock closed at $124.99. "Those are significant returns," Crawford said. Pall agreed to a $127.20 per share cash offer from Danaher in May. 
"It is pretty impressive," said Anoop Rai, a professor of finance at Hofstra University. "There's a lot of value added."
Though Pall's revenue only inched ahead during Kingsley's tenure, he managed to squeeze more cash flow from operations, a metric that appeals to investors, Crawford said.

Other Pall executives and directors are in line to receive equity awards worth up to $8.2 million.
Rai said that large golden parachute payouts sometimes give executives an incentive to merge or sell the business they lead.
After the merger, Danaher has said, Kingsley will work closely with Tom Joyce, Danaher's president and CEO, on the leadership team for after the acquisition.
In another big executive payday, chief executive Robert Marcus of Manhattan's Time Warner Cable Inc. could get at least $85 million if he's terminated within two years of Charter Communications Inc.'s roughly $55 billion acquisition of his company, which was announced in May, Bloomberg has reported.
