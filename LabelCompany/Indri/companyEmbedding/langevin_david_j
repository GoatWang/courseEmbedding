About Us
VERSION FRANÇAISE










Langevin’s Mission: To provide trainers with the skills, knowledge, and materials they need to succeed in their careers.
                    Langevin Learning Services was established in 1984 by Ralph Langevin, an
                    advocate of life-long learning and education. Since that time, Langevin
                    has been a provider of highly renowned workshops and products for 
                    trainers and more recently, has branched out to include virtual 
                    classroom programs, workshops for non-trainers (i.e. business 
                    professionals) as well as professional coaching & consulting 
                    services.
                


                    Over the years, Mr. Langevin has seen his company grow from a one-person shop to the flourishing organization it is today.  The business thrives for two primary reasons:  first, we pride ourselves on providing practical, real-world, performance-based workshops and products that are guaranteed to set you up for success.  Second, Langevin’s top-notch staff and course leaders are committed to providing you with the exceptional service you can expect from Langevin as a result of the many years we’ve been in business.  Our high standards for quality and service speak for themselves; our clients give our course leaders, on average, a rating of 9.7 on a scale of 1 to 10. Don't just take our word for it, read what our clients have to say...
                    Thanks to our valued clients, Langevin Learning Services has become the world’s largest Train-The-Trainer company and a leader in the industry.  We make this claim with confidence since we have the most days of training scheduled per year, the largest 
                    selection of workshops, the largest faculty of full-time, dedicated course leaders, and the largest client base in the training profession.

You'll Be In Good Company




So, who might you bump into at one of Langevin’s workshops?  
                The wide range of clients who enroll in our programs include training 
                professionals from the financial, industrial, transportation, utility, 
                health, technology, retail, and government industries (plus many more).  
                Eighty-two percent of the Fortune 500 companies send their trainers to 
                    Langevin and over 20,000 trainers have already completed their Langevin 
                    Professional Certification for Trainers.
                


                We have also had the pleasure of facilitating workshops with 
                participants from all over the world.  
                
                    To date, 92 countries have sent trainers to participate in Langevin workshops
                 and they come for one reason: 
                 the training and development of their employees.  
                We take this responsibility very seriously by continuing to provide the highest 
                quality products and services that you, and training professionals everywhere, have come to expect from us.
            

                Our public workshops are scheduled in major cities across North America 
                so no matter which city you choose for your program, you are likely to 
                meet a combination of locals and out-of-towners at your workshop.  Our 
                on-site workshops are a different set-up entirely and are scheduled 
                wherever the client wants the workshop to take place.  That could mean 
                anywhere from a boardroom in Lincoln, Nebraska, to the summit of Mount 
                    Everest in Nepal.
                


                If you can't make it to one of our workshops, we have a great selection 
                of training products covering a wide variety of topics.  
                
                    Our products include ebooks, self-study kits, toolkits, and workshop manuals.
                





 






What does this mean for you?



You will gain the highest level of recognition for your credentials plus the skills to have real impact in your organization. We have heard from many clients who have been able to secure a promotion because of the skills and knowledge they have attained from attending our programs. We hope to add your name to our list of success stories!
            






 






"For a trainer, evaluating training (particularly ROI) is job #1! This workshop trains you how to do your job!"
