Agricultural Development Bank of China and China Development Bank, both rated A1/AA– (Moody's/S&P), will sell renminbi notes of a combined 36 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) to onshore and offshore investors under the new "Bond Connect" scheme. The two offerings start today, although the CDB deal will run for two days, and are intended to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1. Bankers and investors, however, are still not clear how the offshore element of the deals will work, given that the landmark Bond Connect trading link is not yet up and running. "We still have lots of questions on the operation and lots of logistics need to be cleared," said one banker involved in the two deals. Bond Connect promises to give offshore investors direct access to China's interbank bond market without the need to open custody and bank accounts on the mainland. Hong Kong and Chinese regulators did not set an official start date when they approved the link in May, but market participants have been working towards a launch on July 3, the first working day after the anniversary celebrations. Guidelines for the initiative arrived in early June, giving traders just a month to prepare for the launch. Late last week, underwriters were still trying to figure out their roles and investors were scrambling to check their eligibility under the scheme. One offshore investor, who had been asked to support the two pilot deals, told IFR the application had been unexpectedly rejected last week because the institution had already opened an onshore account. When asked last Thursday in Hong Kong if the path had been cleared for offshore investors to participate in onshore primary issues, Jimmy Jim, co-head of global markets department at ICBC (Asia), said the changes involved made Bond Connect a "revolution". "There are certain rules yet to be announced, so I don't have any inside information on that." ICBC (Asia) is one of eight cross-border coordinators on the ABDC deal and one of 10 on the CDB offering. PILOT DEALS In the first phase, Bond Connect will allow foreign and Hong Kong investors to buy onshore bonds in the primary or secondary markets, under the so-called northbound trading link. Only new issues sold with a prospectus in both Chinese and English will be available to offshore investors. The first batch of primary issuers will be well-known Chinese borrowers already with international ratings, according to market sources. Beside the two policy banks, state-owned enterprises China Three Gorges and Aluminum Corporation of China are also among the first batch of issuers. One or two Panda bond offerings may also be included, sources have said. ADBC, which tapped the Dim Sum bond market in its previous offshore bond deal in 2014, is planning two rounds of tenders for the new offering, the first for both offshore and onshore investors on Monday morning and the second for offshore investors only on Monday afternoon. ADBC aims to raise up to 16 billion yuan from one-year, three-year and five-year notes. CDB, a frequent issuer in both renminbi and US dollars, at first did not make any special arrangements for offshore investors, but last Friday said it would add a day of marketing for offshore investors on Monday. The CDB issue will be split into 5 billion yuan one-year, 5 billion yuan three-year and 10 billion yuan 10-year tranches, to be priced on Tuesday. Both issuers will auction the notes through a public tender on the People's Bank of China's onshore issuance system. ADBC and CDB have each employed a large group of cross-border coordinators for their issues, in addition to onshore syndicate groups of 82 and 38 members, respectively. However, cross-border coordinators involved are not so sure about their jobs. "I think our role is to introduce offshore investors to the second round of the tender for ADBC in the afternoon," said one of the cross-border advisers. The banker said the pricing for ADBC's notes should be decided after the first-round auction on Monday morning, but she did not know when the allocations would be confirmed. Another banker involved in the two deals said he was still waiting for clarification over his bank's role. OFFSHORE INTEREST? Despite the fanfare around the launch of Bond Connect, overseas appetite for renminbi bonds is likely to be limited. Foreign investors have been slow to take advantage of new rules allowing direct access to the onshore Chinese market, given expectations of further renminbi weakness and rising domestic yields. Market participants say recent signs of currency stabilisation, as well as higher yields and much better liquidity in the onshore market than in the offshore Dim Sum arena, will help rekindle international interest in onshore renminbi bonds. "In general we see strong value in the onshore renminbi- denominated Chinese government bonds and policy bank bonds as we see their bonds yields are too high relative to the benign inflation in China," said Ken Hu, CIO for Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco. He cautioned, however, that the scheme may cause some "teething problems" for the international custodian banks as the operational details were only recently released. Analysts say it will take more time for foreign investors to get comfortable with the new framework. "I suppose the offshore demand (for the policy bank notes) will be primarily from offshore Chinese investors," said a credit analyst at a foreign bank, one of the 20 onshore market makers under the Bond Connect scheme. "The schedule is so tight, but applications take time. So, why should foreign investors rush? Why not wait until everything is sorted out?" International investors still have questions about mutual supervision, withholding tax, beneficial ownership and the treatment of the scheme under European UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) regulations, analysts say. It is also not yet clear whether entities that already have access to Chinese bonds through QFII quotas or onshore accounts are eligible under Bond Connect. "The background for the Bond Connect is very much to diversify the investor base (for onshore bonds). In that sense, it is an issue for Bond Connect to look at how to avoid the duplication of the investor base," said Jim of ICBC (Asia). The rush to market, however, underlines China's determination to attract global investment into its domestic bond market. "Every reform here starts with a pilot programme," said a DCM banker.

Bauxite Mining Market to Remain Lucrative During by 2020




Bauxite popularly known as aluminum ore is the major source of aluminum. Bauxite is a mixture of minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore, iron oxides such as goethite and hematite, clay mineral kaolinite and some amounts of anatase.This press release was orginally distributed by SBWireNew York, NY -- (SBWIRE) -- 07/13/2017 --  Bauxite popularly known as aluminum ore is the major source of aluminum. Bauxite is a mixture of minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore, iron oxides such as goethite and hematite, clay mineral kaolinite and some amounts of anatase. Bauxite are found majorly in the tropical and sub-tropical regions such as Africa, West Indies, South America, Australia, Asian countries such as India and China and some parts of Europe (in small quantity). Australia is the largest producer and exporter of bauxite globally, with five bauxite mine contributing more than one fourth of the global bauxite production. There are five steps involved in the extraction of bauxite starting with preparation of bauxite area, secondly, bauxite mining, crushing, ore transportation and lastly rehabilitation of land. On an average one square meter of land can extract one metric ton of aluminum.To access full report @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/bauxite…Around 85% of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina which is further used for the production of aluminum metal. Other major application of bauxite mining is for commercial purpose such as abrasives and refractory's. Automobile industry is the major end-user of aluminum metal owing to associated benefits of aluminum metals such as corrosion-free, high-density and lightweight features. North America has the largest market share for bauxite mining owing to increased aluminum demand in the region. Europe and Asia Pacific region follows North America in bauxite demand. North America is expected to maintain its dominance in the forecasted period. Europe is expected to witness marginal growth.

Organization[edit]
The company has a number of distinct business segments including (1) alumina refining, (2) primary aluminum smelting, and (3) energy.[4] The alumina refining segment consists of mining and purchasing bauxite, refining bauxite into alumina, and production and sales of alumina chemicals and metal gallium.[4] The aluminum smelting segment smelts alumina to produce primary aluminum and also produces carbon products, aluminum alloy products, and other aluminum products.[4] Finally the energy segment produces coal, generates electricity from coal, develops wind and solar power, manufactures new energy equipment, and integrates coal electricity generation with aluminum operations.[4]
Until 2013, it was also engaged in aluminum fabrication but has since sold this business line.

History[edit]
Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) is a state-backed holding company established to be the primary aluminium producer in the People's Republic of China in 2001.[5] It is the parent company of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco) which is listed on the New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.[5]
Effective from 10 June 2008, Chalco was added to the Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock (blue chip).[6]
Chinalco is investing $3 billion to begin open-cast mining operations, within three to four years, in Morococha District, Peru. The company plans to extract copper ore from Mount Toromocho.[7]
Chinalco holds a 9% stake in the Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto.[8] Rio Tinto controls large Iron ore reserves in Australia. On June 5, Rio Tinto broke a deal for Chinalco to purchase a larger stake in the company, with support by rival Anglo-Australian mining company BHP Billiton. Rio Tinto is expected to pay a US$195 million breaking fee according to the contract signed earlier by the two parties.[9]
In 2010, Chinalco reported a net profit of ¥778.01 million, a dramatic rise when compared with the company's ¥4.62 billion losses from the previous year. The company credits increased prices and effective cost control strategies with the financial turnaround.[10]
During July 2011, Chinalco signed a long-term agreement with Mongolian miner Tavan Tolgoi to import more than 15 million tons of coking coal annually to meet increased domestic demand.[11]
Operations[edit]
Engineering and technical services[edit]
A subsidiary is China Aluminum International Engineering (Chalieco) which consists of businesses in engineering design and consultancy, engineering and construction contracting and equipment manufacturing. As a contractor it is the 124th largest construction firm in the world as ranked by Engineering News-Record in 2013.[12] Chalieco was publicly listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2012.
Aluminum fabrication[edit]
Through its aluminum fabrication unit, which was sold in 2013, Chinalco sold casting products, slab band products, foils, squeezing products, forging products, powder products, die-casting products, remelted aluminum ingots, and gallium metal and gallium oxide. These products are used in construction, electricity, packaging, transportation, nondurable consumer goods, hard board material, wire and cable, ceramics, refractory material, laundry, petrochemical, and aerospace industries.
Peru[edit]
As of 2013, Morococha was the site of a planned open pit copper mine to be operated by Aluminum Corporation of China Limited. A new town for the 5,000 residents of Morococha has been built about 6 miles away, but some residents were reported to be resisting location. The mine is projected to produce about 250,000 tons of copper a year for about 35 years.[13]
In April 2017, owing to Peru's increasing importance as a copper supplier to China, Chinalco announced an investment of $1.3 billion to expand copper production after failing to reach its output target last year. The expansion is projected to add 70,000 tonnes a year to the project.[14]
Joint Venture with Rio Tinto[edit]
In 2011, China Aluminum Corporation and Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, created a joint venture in order to explore deposits in China.[15] According to Rio Tinto chief executive Tom Albanese, the joint venture was meant to be “an important milestone in the expanding relationship between Rio Tinto and China.” Chinalco was the majority stakeholder of the project, holding 51% of shares, while Rio Tinto held 49%.[15]
On January 18, 2017, it was reported that the two corporations had terminated the joint venture, and had begun to liquidate the joint venture company, Chinalco Rio Tinto Exploration Co.[16]

A new town for the 5,000 residents of Morococha has been built about 6 miles away, but some residents were reported to be resisting location. The mine is projected to produce about 250,000 tons of copper a year for about 35 years.[13]
In April 2017, owing to Peru's increasing importance as a copper supplier to China, Chinalco announced an investment of $1.3 billion to expand copper production after failing to reach its output target last year. The expansion is projected to add 70,000 tonnes a year to the project.[14]
Joint Venture with Rio Tinto[edit]
In 2011, China Aluminum Corporation and Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, created a joint venture in order to explore deposits in China.[15] According to Rio Tinto chief executive Tom Albanese, the joint venture was meant to be “an important milestone in the expanding relationship between Rio Tinto and China.” Chinalco was the majority stakeholder of the project, holding 51% of shares, while Rio Tinto held 49%.[15]
On January 18, 2017, it was reported that the two corporations had terminated the joint venture, and had begun to liquidate the joint venture company, Chinalco Rio Tinto Exploration Co.[16]

Organization[edit]
The company has a number of distinct business segments including (1) alumina refining, (2) primary aluminum smelting, and (3) energy.[4] The alumina refining segment consists of mining and purchasing bauxite, refining bauxite into alumina, and production and sales of alumina chemicals and metal gallium.[4] The aluminum smelting segment smelts alumina to produce primary aluminum and also produces carbon products, aluminum alloy products, and other aluminum products.[4] Finally the energy segment produces coal, generates electricity from coal, develops wind and solar power, manufactures new energy equipment, and integrates coal electricity generation with aluminum operations.[4]
Until 2013, it was also engaged in aluminum fabrication but has since sold this business line.

History[edit]
Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) is a state-backed holding company established to be the primary aluminium producer in the People's Republic of China in 2001.[5] It is the parent company of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco) which is listed on the New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.[5]
Effective from 10 June 2008, Chalco was added to the Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock (blue chip).[6]
Chinalco is investing $3 billion to begin open-cast mining operations, within three to four years, in Morococha District, Peru. The company plans to extract copper ore from Mount Toromocho.[7]
Chinalco holds a 9% stake in the Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto.[8] Rio Tinto controls large Iron ore reserves in Australia. On June 5, Rio Tinto broke a deal for Chinalco to purchase a larger stake in the company, with support by rival Anglo-Australian mining company BHP Billiton. Rio Tinto is expected to pay a US$195 million breaking fee according to the contract signed earlier by the two parties.[9]
In 2010, Chinalco reported a net profit of ¥778.01 million, a dramatic rise when compared with the company's ¥4.62 billion losses from the previous year. The company credits increased prices and effective cost control strategies with the financial turnaround.[10]
During July 2011, Chinalco signed a long-term agreement with Mongolian miner Tavan Tolgoi to import more than 15 million tons of coking coal annually to meet increased domestic demand.[11]
Operations[edit]
Engineering and technical services[edit]
A subsidiary is China Aluminum International Engineering (Chalieco) which consists of businesses in engineering design and consultancy, engineering and construction contracting and equipment manufacturing. As a contractor it is the 124th largest construction firm in the world as ranked by Engineering News-Record in 2013.[12] Chalieco was publicly listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2012.
Aluminum fabrication[edit]
Through its aluminum fabrication unit, which was sold in 2013, Chinalco sold casting products, slab band products, foils, squeezing products, forging products, powder products, die-casting products, remelted aluminum ingots, and gallium metal and gallium oxide. These products are used in construction, electricity, packaging, transportation, nondurable consumer goods, hard board material, wire and cable, ceramics, refractory material, laundry, petrochemical, and aerospace industries.
Peru[edit]
As of 2013, Morococha was the site of a planned open pit copper mine to be operated by Aluminum Corporation of China Limited. A new town for the 5,000 residents of Morococha has been built about 6 miles away, but some residents were reported to be resisting location. The mine is projected to produce about 250,000 tons of copper a year for about 35 years.[13]
In April 2017, owing to Peru's increasing importance as a copper supplier to China, Chinalco announced an investment of $1.3 billion to expand copper production after failing to reach its output target last year. The expansion is projected to add 70,000 tonnes a year to the project.[14]
Joint Venture with Rio Tinto[edit]

On January 18, 2017, it was reported that the two corporations had terminated the joint venture, and had begun to liquidate the joint venture company, Chinalco Rio Tinto Exploration Co.[16]

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
