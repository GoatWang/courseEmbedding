MARKET RESEARCH





MARKETS SERVED BY CENCOSUD
					 

This section provides readers 
				with commercial intelligence on the markets in Chile, 
				and the Cities and Towns in the country. This section gives both a narrative description (about 
				2215 pages) of the various matters 
				covered as well as provides readers with the ability to directly 
				use the Chapters (via Microsoft Word or compatible word 
				processors) to produce their own reports and documentation. 
				 Experienced users will be able to use the spreadsheet and 
				databases to generate highly detailed narrative reports, charts 
				and graphics - as well as sophisticated business and commercial 
				forecasts and models. The databases are provided in both Excel 
				spreadsheets (about 3660 spreadsheets) and an Access database 
				tables (about 3810 tables). Explanatory notes are provided as word processor
    documents or in PDF formats.  
 



The narrative
    is necessarily illustrative in its terminology and seeks to provide a basic
    degree of business logic and theory which indicates the rational applied in
    the forecasting and modelling methodology.


 



The databases provided are specifically
    designed to provide users with a uniform and consistent numeric measure of
    both (normally) quantifiable values as well as conceptual factors which are
    (usually) only capable of qualification. Experienced users will know how to
    apply forecasting and modelling software to the numeric data provided to
    generate highly detailed and discrete business planning models. The
    databases provided in this report can be used directly with databases on
    other product, markets and industries in other countries. The databases are
    specifically designed to be trans-national, currency neutral, inflation and
    purchasing parity adjusted, product parity and product equivalent adjusted,
    opportunity cost adjusted, and numerically compatible; they all can be
    linked or merged programmatically in business planning models to provide
    multi-national and multi-level analysis.





Before using the data provided please
    read the Database
    Introduction as well as the Notes and Definitions links found in
    each Chapter. There are subtle statistical nuances to some of the
    spreadsheets and databases which will help the user to fine-tune their
    models and forecasts to obtain maximum effect and greater accuracy. The
    database flow chart and database description should be consulted when
    applying statistical and modelling software.
