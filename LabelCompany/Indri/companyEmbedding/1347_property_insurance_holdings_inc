FAQ
Below are answers to some of the more frequently asked questions we receive.
How does this service work?
Homeinsuranceweb.com has a large network of licensed insurance agents across the US. Once you have submitted your information to our system, Homeinsuranceweb.com may instantly match you with local agents in your area. Those agents will run free insurance quotes for you and provide those quotes via the information you have provided. This process may save you time and money because you can compare rates from multiple companies without having to contact numerous agents and provide your information several times.
Any agents that our system matches you with may provide you free insurance quotes for you with no obligation on your part. You can choose to receive these quotes either via email or over the phone – which means you can start receiving insurance quotes in a short amount of time.
Is Homeinsuranceweb.com an insurance company?
No, we are not an insurance company. We are a free referral service for insurance shoppers. We do not have information on your existing insurance policies, claims, etc. If you have a question regarding an existing or previous policy, please contact your agent or carrier directly.
I have already submitted my information, when may I get my quote?
The agents who receive your request may usually begin running your insurance quotes immediately, and may often provide detailed pricing information within minutes. However, some insurance quotes are more complicated and may require a little more time to process. Regardless, you should always receive your online insurance quotes within 48 hours at most.
How do I get an insurance quote?
To get a free, no-obligation insurance quote, just go to the top of the page, enter your zip code, select the type of insurance for which you want a quote, then click "GO."
Is Homeinsuranceweb.com affiliated with any insurance companies?
No, we are not directly affiliated with any insurance companies. Insurance agents who directly represent many insurance companies are part of our nationwide network.
How does getting a bunch of insurance quotes online help me?
Just like anything else you buy, insurance is a product that varies widely from provider to provider. Like stereos or computers, finding an insurance policy that provides everything you need – and nothing you don’t – requires taking the time to make comparisons.
Making comparisons, however, can be time consuming. Most agencies that offer insurance quotes online may want to collect a bunch of information from you up front so that they can build a customized policy that suits your request. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it does make looking for affordable insurance a time-consuming hassle. As a result, most consumers shopping for insurance online give up after the second or third try, simply because they don’t want to fill out any more forms.
Homeinsuranceweb.com saves you headaches by providing you with a wide variety of insurance quotes from a large selection of local agencies in the same amount of time it would normally take to get a single quote from one online insurance provider. Having a larger selection means you can make more comparisons, and making more comparisons means you're more likely to find an affordable insurance policy that meets your specific needs.

Site Evaluations

Reducing Your Risk Starts with Identifying It


Identifying your company’s risks starts with a site visit. Our specially trained engineers visit your facilities and evaluate them based on construction, occupancy, protection and exposure. Our engineers also examine your hazard management programs, to identify any gaps or human elements that could put your business at risk.
 Your loss prevention consultant then provides you with an FM Global Risk Report, a detailed explanation of the exposures that could cause a property loss at your facility, and works with you to craft a thorough, cost-effective loss prevention program that reflects your business and risk management objectives.

In-depth Analytics
In addition to five-year country trends, each country can be explored deeper than ever before so you can glean more powerful insights.

FAQ
Below are answers to some of the more frequently asked questions we receive.
How does this service work?
Homeinsuranceweb.com has a large network of licensed insurance agents across the US. Once you have submitted your information to our system, Homeinsuranceweb.com may instantly match you with local agents in your area. Those agents will run free insurance quotes for you and provide those quotes via the information you have provided. This process may save you time and money because you can compare rates from multiple companies without having to contact numerous agents and provide your information several times.
Any agents that our system matches you with may provide you free insurance quotes for you with no obligation on your part. You can choose to receive these quotes either via email or over the phone – which means you can start receiving insurance quotes in a short amount of time.
Is Homeinsuranceweb.com an insurance company?
No, we are not an insurance company. We are a free referral service for insurance shoppers. We do not have information on your existing insurance policies, claims, etc. If you have a question regarding an existing or previous policy, please contact your agent or carrier directly.
I have already submitted my information, when may I get my quote?
The agents who receive your request may usually begin running your insurance quotes immediately, and may often provide detailed pricing information within minutes. However, some insurance quotes are more complicated and may require a little more time to process. Regardless, you should always receive your online insurance quotes within 48 hours at most.
How do I get an insurance quote?
To get a free, no-obligation insurance quote, just go to the top of the page, enter your zip code, select the type of insurance for which you want a quote, then click "GO."
Is Homeinsuranceweb.com affiliated with any insurance companies?
No, we are not directly affiliated with any insurance companies. Insurance agents who directly represent many insurance companies are part of our nationwide network.
How does getting a bunch of insurance quotes online help me?
Just like anything else you buy, insurance is a product that varies widely from provider to provider. Like stereos or computers, finding an insurance policy that provides everything you need – and nothing you don’t – requires taking the time to make comparisons.
Making comparisons, however, can be time consuming. Most agencies that offer insurance quotes online may want to collect a bunch of information from you up front so that they can build a customized policy that suits your request. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it does make looking for affordable insurance a time-consuming hassle. As a result, most consumers shopping for insurance online give up after the second or third try, simply because they don’t want to fill out any more forms.
Homeinsuranceweb.com saves you headaches by providing you with a wide variety of insurance quotes from a large selection of local agencies in the same amount of time it would normally take to get a single quote from one online insurance provider. Having a larger selection means you can make more comparisons, and making more comparisons means you're more likely to find an affordable insurance policy that meets your specific needs.

Site Evaluations

Reducing Your Risk Starts with Identifying It


Identifying your company’s risks starts with a site visit. Our specially trained engineers visit your facilities and evaluate them based on construction, occupancy, protection and exposure. Our engineers also examine your hazard management programs, to identify any gaps or human elements that could put your business at risk.
 Your loss prevention consultant then provides you with an FM Global Risk Report, a detailed explanation of the exposures that could cause a property loss at your facility, and works with you to craft a thorough, cost-effective loss prevention program that reflects your business and risk management objectives.

also add data theft and cyber coverage to help your business recover if systems
and/or customer information are exposed. Additionally, you can enhance your protection with other coverage options such as:Commercial AutoInland MarineUmbrellaWorkers CompensationLearn MoreWe offer BOPs and commercial packages for a variety of business types,

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
