"Quality Service, Sales and 100% Satisfaction...is our most valuable business."
.







Why select us...?
Most laboratories are full of many kinds
          of scientific equipment and instrumentation
          from a variety of manufacturers.
  When instrument services are needed, this
          variety is translated into lost productivity
          and money as lab personnel are forced to
