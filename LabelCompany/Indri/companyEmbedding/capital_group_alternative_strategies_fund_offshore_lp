New Commodity Pool Launches January 2017 - Rayner Gobran

New Commodity Pool Launches January 2017
 by IanRayner | Feb 1, 2017 | 0 comments









This is the first in a series of monthly posts about new commodity pool launches.
A hedge fund is typically registered as commodity pool, and the underlying strategy can often be inferred from the name. New pool registrations give you useful market and competitive information! If nothing else, you may get a heads-up that a competitor is bringing something new to market.
The source of data is the National Futures Association’s (NFA) Background Affiliation Status Information Center (BASIC) website. These posts will form a series parallel to the one I recently started on the largest hedge funds by regulatory assets under management. That series uses data sourced from the SEC’s Investment Advisor Public Depository website.
Around 500 new pools are registered with the NFA each month, so I don’t have space to list them all here. I will limit the table to those pools registered by the largest hedge fund firms. This way you will be able to see the latest product-related strategic moves being made by the biggest players.



 



If you are interested in a data file which includes the 650+ most recently registered pools use the adjacent “Request File” button. If you want the file delivered to an email address let me know via our contact form (opens in a new tab).

The January file is no longer available. The button will deliver the current version.

Methodology
In order to complete the research for this post, I made use of a script in R using the RSelenium package. I have previously published a post about how to set up RSelenium using the latest version of Selenium, and an earlier post reviewing some of the most useful functions in the package. This package makes it possible to automate the collection of data from websites; the process is called web-scraping.
The NFA assigns pool ID numbers in numerical order. I start with the most recently identified pool and increment the pool ID, then search in BASIC for that pool. If the pool is found, I record the name(s) and ID(s) of the Commodity Pool Operator(s). I also check for the date the pool ceased trading futures or ceased trading altogether, to ensure I do not include dead pools. I keep going until I run out of pools (I check at least 100 successive pool IDs have no pool associated with them).
Finally, for the purpose of this post, I purge the list of pool operators who do not appear on my 100 largest hedge funds master list. Note that this list includes about 350+ firms who are affiliated with the various large hedge fund companies.
