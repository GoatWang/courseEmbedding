      We have winners for the Belle Creek Proxy Raffle - click here to see if you are one of the winners.
      For more information on what these proxies are about go to the HOA dissolution page.
    

      Belle Creek residents value our neighborhood. We care about the happiness of our neighbors, the stability of the community,
      and the value of our homes. These values are the purpose for the Covenant Enforcement Committee.
    

      Belle Creek is one of many newer neighborhoods that has a Metropolitan District (also known as a Metro District), instead
      of a Homeowners Association. The most notable difference, for homeowners, is that payments for common area maintenance,
      covenant enforcement, and the family center are made as a part of your annual property tax payment.
    

      The Belle Creek Metro District has one five-person board (MDB), which manages the Metro District and empowers the Covenant
      Enforcement Committee (CEC). The MDB is responsible for the annual Belle Creek budget and generally fulfilling the requirements
      of a Metropolitan District, and is currently developer controlled with one resident board member. In contrast, the CEC
      is a group of volunteer Belle Creek homeowners whose sole purpose is to work with the Covenant Enforcement Manager (Wolfersberger
      LLC) and the District Manager (Mulhern MRE) to ensure fair and consistent covenants are in place and people are held to
      the appropriate standards. The CEC does this by assessing community concerns, handling violation disputes, and approving/rejecting
      architectural review requests. All of the decisions of the CEC are upheld by the powers given to the MDB by the Master
      Declaration of Covenants and by-laws.
    

      If you discover a sprinkler problem in the common areas of the community, please call Brightview at
       303-472-6812 to help ensure the common areas are as beautiful as they can be.
