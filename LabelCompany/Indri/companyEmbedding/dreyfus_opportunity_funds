Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Notes & Disclosures
 For share classes offered after the fund's inception date, the total returns quoted reflect the performance of the fund's initial share class(es), adjusted to reflect applicable non-recurring sales charges. Performance for these share classes has not been adjusted to reflect any class-specific distribution or servicing fees or any differences in operating expenses. Had such fees and expenses been reflected, returns for these share class returns during such periods would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.The Ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's performance and gives more emphasis to downward variations. The top 10% of the funds in the category receive five stars; the next 22.5% four stars; the next 35% three stars; the next 22.5% two stars; and the last 10% one star.  Ratings reflect sales loads.The fund represents a single portfolio with multiple share classes that have different expense structures. The Dreyfus Corporation has contractually agreed to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the expenses of the fund until March 31, 2018, so 
that the direct expenses of none of the classes (exclusive of Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder service fees, taxes, brokerage fees, interest on       borrowings, commitment fees and extraordinary expenses) exceed .95%. 
The "Dreyfus Investment Style Classification" graphically depicts the fund's investment strategy as described in its Prospectus. The horizontal and vertical axes describe the fund's investment style and market capitalization range for stocks in the fund's portfolio, respectively. It is designed to support asset allocation decisions and not to depict actual fund holdings at a point in time.

Notes & Disclosures
Portfolio composition and allocation is as of 06/30/17 and is subject to change at any time. Totals may not be exact due to rounding. Negative exposures may represent short positions through derivatives.The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security. Large concentrations can increase share price volatility.Price/earnings for a stock is the ratio of the company's most recent month-end share price to the company's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the current fiscal year. If a third-party estimate for the current year EPS is not available, Morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported EPS and average historical earnings growth rates. Price/ earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the Morningstar Style Box. For portfolios, this historical P/E data point is calculated by taking an asset-weighted average of the earnings yields (E/P) of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result. Source: MorningstarReflects the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark. An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark. In order to compare funds across general asset classes, Morningstar calculates R-squared values relative to a "standard" broad-based market index. For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index. Thus, the "standard" broad-based market index used by Morningstar may differ from the fund's actual benchmark stated in this factsheet. Source: MorningstarBeta is a measure of the systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio and is an indicator of expected return. A beta higher than 1.0 has higher risk than the overall market has and thus the stock or portfolio can be expected to perform in relation to the overall market in that way.A statistical measurement of dispersion around an average which depicts how widely fund returns varied over a certain period of time.

Fund Goal and Approach



The fund seeks high total return through a combination of capital appreciation and current income. To pursue this goal, the fund invests in a diversified mix of stocks and fixed-income securities. The fund selects securities that, in the portfolio managers' judgment, will result in the highest total return consistent with preservation of principal. The fund normally will allocate between 25% and 50% of its assets to fixed-income securities.




				Risks
			



				
					Allocation Risk: Asset allocation cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There can be no guarantee that any particular level of return, or the fund's investment objective, will be achieved.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Small Cap Risk: Small and midsize companies carry additional risks because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable, and their share prices more volatile than those of larger, more established companies. The shares of smaller companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger, more established companies.Stock and Bond Market Risk: The stock and bond markets can perform differently from each other at any given time (as well as over the long term), so the fund will be affected by its asset allocation. If the fund  favors an asset class during a period when that class underperforms, performance may be hurt.

The performance data quotes represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Yield, share price and investment return fluctuate and an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Click above for month-end returns.
The total return performance figures presented for Class I shares of the fund represent the performance of the fund's Class J for periods prior to January 30, 2004, the inception date for Class I shares, and the performance of Class I, respectively, from that inception date. Performance reflects the applicable class' distribution/servicing fees since the inception date. Had these fees and expenses been reflected for periods prior, performance would have been different. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Allocation Risk: Asset allocation cannot ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There can be no guarantee that any particular level of return, or the fund's investment objective, will be achieved.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Small Cap Risk: Small and midsize companies carry additional risks because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable, and their share prices more volatile than those of larger, more established companies. The shares of smaller companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger, more established companies.Stock and Bond Market Risk: The stock and bond markets can perform differently from each other at any given time (as well as over the long term), so the fund will be affected by its asset allocation. If the fund favors an asset class during a period when that class underperforms, performance may be hurt.

Overview






		Why invest in this Fund?
The fund seeks to maximize current income exempt from federal income tax to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital.To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in municipal bonds that provide income exempt from federal income tax. Typically, the fund invests substantially all of its assets in such municipal bonds. The fund invests at least 70% of its assets in municipal bonds rated, at   the time of purchase, investment grade or the unrated equivalent as determined by The Dreyfus Corporation. For additional yield, the fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in municipal bonds rated below investment grade or the unrated equivalent as determined by The Dreyfus Corporation.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Bond Risk: Bonds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines.Credit Risk: High yield bonds are subject to increased credit risk and are considered speculative in terms of the issuer's perceived ability to continue making interest payments on a timely basis and to repay principal upon maturity.
