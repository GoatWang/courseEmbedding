The IT department for Laureate Education Inc. is responsible for developing and supporting the company's day-to-day business operations. The department can be divided into two teams including infrastructure and applications.

Its daily and weekly total data backup is 180TB and 260TB respectively, with an 8 hours backup window. Its backup growth is around 25. Relating to its remote locations, data is backed up locally, and some remote locations have WAN optimization deployed. 

The IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

Laureate Education, Inc. Reports Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Re-Affirms Earnings Guidance for the Full Year 2017
May 11 17
Laureate Education, Inc. reported consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the period, the company reported revenue of $855.9 million against $906.5 million a year ago. Operating loss was $62.9 million compared with $11.2 million a year ago. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net loss of affiliates was $147.4 million compared with $92.2 million a year ago. Net income attributable to company was $122.8 million compared with $103.2 million a year ago. Basic and diluted loss per share were $1.05 compared with $0.76 a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $39.8 million against $89.3 million a year ago. Purchase of property and equipment was $37.1 million against $39.8 million a year ago. EBITDA was $1.6 million against $55 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.6 million compared with $74 million a year ago. 


The company is reaffirming the financial guidance previously provided for full-year 2017. The guidance for 2017 reflects the impact from the sale of French and Swiss assets in 2016, which will unfavorably impact both year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA by approximately (3%). Additionally, currency translation from foreign exchange rates, based on current rates, is expected to cause a (1%) reduction year-over-year in 2017 for Adjusted EBITDA, with no material impact on Revenue expected. Revenues in the range of $4,287 million to $4,348 million, representing 4.5% to 6.0% organic (pro forma for asset dispositions in 2016) constant currency growth. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $789 million to $804 million, representing 8.0% to 10.0% organic (pro forma for asset dispositions in 2016) constant currency growth. Capex spending at 7% to 8% of revenues to support growth initiatives and ongoing maintenance increase in total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding by approximately 55.7 million, resulting from the conversion of the Exchanged Notes and $400 million of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (assuming payment-in-kind dividends), in each case not later than February 7, 2018, based on a conversion price of $14.00 per share of Class A common stock, the price per share to the public in IPO; and reported earnings per share in 2017 to be affected by a $290 million to $300 million non-cash charge to earnings per share related to accounting for the non-cash beneficial redemption and conversion features due to the terms of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
