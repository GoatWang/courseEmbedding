A Visionary Call to Action
Sonia Gavasso on the potential for mass cytometry to improve immunotherapy
Spotlight


































CYTO 2017 and the
 6th Annual Mass Cytometry Summit


Sonia Gavasso will be in Boston in June for CYTO® 2017 with colleagues presenting posters on mass cytometry and flow cytometry. “Our poster will be on MS and natalizumab (Tysabri®), a blocking antibody to alpha 4 integrin that the FDA approved in 2004 to treat relapsing MS.” She will also attend the 6th Annual Mass Cytometry Summit the day before CYTO: “I’ve been to the Mass Cytometry Summit several times, and I will go this time as well, absolutely. It’s amazing to meet all these people with so much know-how there.”

Researcher Sonia Gavasso, PhD, with the Neuroimmunology Lab at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, recently chatted with Fluidigm about the role of mass cytometry in her team’s cancer research. Gavasso anticipates that mass cytometry, or cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (the technology used in the CyTOF® system), will help to align diagnostics with current biological understandings of cancer, noting that monitoring therapies is key to making better decisions.

Defining immunotherapy approaches

There’s always talk about the importance of developing personalized therapies in the clinic, but she believes there should also be personalized monitoring. Fueling her work at University of Bergen through self-described fascination and love of science, Gavasso explained, “I have a passion for biology and an imagination for complexity. When I moved to Norway and joined the Haukeland University Hospital, I began studying immunology and central nervous system diseases, which are highly complex. That’s where mass cytometry comes in.”

In the Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics paper, “Single-cell proteomics: potential implications for cancer diagnostics,” Gavasso et al. issue an inspiring call for researchers to develop solutions addressing key problems in sustainable health care. “We believe new and emerging technologies will allow us to move from mostly empirical decisions to tailored treatments enabling fast and early decisions regarding response,” she said. “It would be the holy grail, even before treatment starts.”

In human medicine, it’s difficult to predict who will respond to an immunotherapy. The paper outlines an integral need for hands-on, simple technology to monitor response over time, rather than administering long-term treatment before differentiating between responders and nonresponders.

 “Mass cytometry has amazing potential. I don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’, but it’s close to it. This is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do.”
  —Sonia Gavasso, PhD, Neuroimmunology Lab, Haukeland University, Norway

Enter, Helios

Gavasso wanted to get a view of the immune system and how it behaves during therapy. “One out of three people die from cancer and it’s increasing, so something has to happen. There’s a real need for single-cell analysis technologies that revolutionize what we can do in research to translate into clinical diagnostics and monitoring. With CyTOF technology,” she continued, “we can go much deeper into whole system immunophenotyping to see where these medications actually work and where the antibody binds and has an effect. This is a completely new, holistic way to look at and monitor the immune system.”

When she heard about CyTOF technology in 2009, Gavasso remembered, some were skeptical, but she was thinking: “‘We should absolutely do this.’ I was fascinated and super excited about it.” She visited scientists in Paris who had a mass cytometer and recalled being amazed seeing it in action. “In Norway, they like established procedures and technologies so we had to wait a long time, but we didn’t give up.” Their Helios™ was a gift to the Haukeland University Hospital and University in Bergen funded through a Bergen Research Foundation grant.

“We now have a Helios system and it’s running really well. We have our own dedicated mass cytometry team here to take care of the system and run mass cytometry at the hospital where we collect lots of cells in clinical trials.” Gavasso holds great hopes for mass cytometry, citing around 20 major cryobanks collecting cell samples for mass cytometry applications in cancer, rheumatic, neurological and central nervous system diseases and advanced therapies like cryoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation. “We plan to get another Helios, and we look forward to being able to expand our mass cytometry capabilities with tissue imaging.”

Advantages over flow cytometry

The visualization in mass cytometry data is a major plus for Gavasso. “With mass cytometry, we’re finally getting a view of the elusive immune response in immune therapies. Disease systems are so complex. It’s super that we can look at a certain cell but not lose information about what other cell types are doing, or where they are within the immune system. That is absolutely unbelievable,” she said.

“Previously, this type of information was difficult to obtain in a single analysis with flow cytometry, and mass cytometry clearly expands our horizon,” she noted, “so we can monitor complexity.” Her team reported debulking in leukemia during kinase inhibitor treatment as early as seven days after starting. They also saw where a medicinal antibody binds and in which cell subtype. “It is unprecedented. We would not do this on the flow cytometer. There are too many tubes that are difficult to combine and need lots of controls.”

Gavasso gave the example of how medications come to the field after successful clinical trials, but how they actually work is often unknown, so researchers like her must rush to explain the mechanistic action. For her, mass cytometry is the technology to discover what immune-modulating compounds do in the immune system. “I am a believer,” she said. “Mass cytometry has amazing potential. I don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’, but it’s close to it. This is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do.”

Her lab in Bergen is currently running major Helios projects for which they’re collecting tissue and cell samples. For one study, they’re using Helios to monitor cryoimmunotherapy response in prostate cancer. Another involves developing stem cell transplant treatment approaches for MS and for leukemia using CyTOF technology to understand how the immune system reconstitutes after stem cell transplantation and immune ablation. The team is also studying graft versus host disease in cancer.

 “Mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using, it’s actually much, much better.”
  —Sonia Gavasso, PhD, Neuroimmunology Lab, Haukeland University, Norway

Papers in the pipeline

 Gavasso has a proof-of-principle chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) study of treatment with nilotinib (Tasigna®), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in press. “We’d see clear changes three hours after initiating therapy and debulking after one week in this ENEST1 clinical trial substudy.” The team has the opportunity to collect samples before therapy and again within hours of treatment because they work closely with treating physicians in their clinical trial units. “In treatment,” Gavasso explained, “those early tests provide valuable information, so we don’t have to wait a whole year before we can label them responders or nonresponders.”

Ultimately, Gavasso dreams of being able to analyze immune cells in the brain in nervous system diseases. “It’s difficult to collect samples from within the central nervous system. And if we do get them,” she said, “it would be really cool to have excellent technologies for analyzing samples at any level from RNA to DNA to proteomics.”

Bioinformatics approach

Gavasso has several applications for working collaboratively with bioinformaticians to analyze biological, programming, algorithmic and statistical data from Helios, independent of what’s published. Her group works closely with lab mathematicians on topology, studying spatial properties preserved through stretching, crumpling, bending and twisting of objects to verify methodological usability.

Cytobank is a boon, especially for studying the clinical dataset needed to integrate with information from the mass cytometer. “CyTOF technology is better than how we did things before in the clinic, when we had to always select cells and parameters. This is really exciting,” she added. “Mathematicians here in Bergen actually come to us now asking for datasets.”

A new perspective

Mass cytometry for higher-parameter analysis of precious samples offers a number of advantages. “Personally, I was excited to let go of the two-dimensional flow cytometry approach,” she said. “Mass cytometry is amazing, but some people find change difficult and are reluctant to go high-dimension, saying, ‘We’ve been doing things this way forever. It works, so why change now?’” Gavasso’s answer: “Mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using, it’s actually much, much better.”

 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluidigm Corporation (NASDAQ:FLDM) today announced that leading research institutions in the UK have partnered to acquire and implement seven Helios™ mass cytometry systems to empower life-changing discoveries in human health. Supported by the Clinical Research Infrastructure Initiative (CRII) of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry includes researchers from the universities of Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Cambridge, Birmingham and Oxford and University College London.

 Helios utilizes CyTOF® technology to enable deep profiling of translational and clinical research samples across a range of cell surface and intracellular markers by mass cytometry. Designed to significantly reduce signal overlap, mass cytometry empowers researchers to simultaneously interrogate cellular phenotypes, function and signaling status in higher dimension than traditional fluorescent methods. Mass cytometry is especially valuable in research studies when sample volumes are limited.

 In support of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry, Fluidigm sponsored the 2017 UK Mass Cytometry User Meeting, a two-day symposium held in London on March 21 and 22. This meeting brought together scientists from 19 major UK research centers to share recent research advances and best practices in mass cytometry.

 "The Technology Directorate at Liverpool led the procurement and development of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry in the UK," said Professor Robert Beynon, PhD, academic head of the Technology Directorate at the University of Liverpool. "By organizing the UK users meeting, Fluidigm is helping to make this vision, of pooled knowledge and shared infrastructure, a reality."

 Symposium speakers included scientists from within the MRC consortium as well as mass cytometry users from other locations and technical specialists from Fluidigm. Topics included fundamentals of instrument operation and sample preparation, design of high-parameter biomarker panels, best practices for integrating mass cytometry into a core facility and cutting-edge research underway at several consortium locations.

 "My favorite aspects of the meeting were being able to hear and discuss how the different groups associated with the consortium (and indeed other mass cytometry users outside the consortium) have developed and use the technology for different aspects of research, and also how they have adapted mass cytometry within their core service providers for wider use by their universities," said Joseph Slupsky, PhD, academic lead for the University of Liverpool Cell Sorting and Mass Cytometry Facility.

 Dr. Slupsky's research is focused on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). "I am using mass cytometry to measure phenotypic changes, signal transduction and gene expression within distinct subpopulations of CLL cells," Dr. Slupsky said. "Mass cytometry will also be used to understand patient response to drug therapy in this disease and gain insight into the mechanisms of drug toxicity and efficacy."

 "We are enthusiastic about the collective power of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry to achieve new breakthroughs in an environment of shared infrastructure and best practices," said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO of Fluidigm. "The great progress these institutions have made since the successful installation of these seven systems was evident at our recent UK user meeting."

The promising field of immuno-oncology presents many unanswered questions for scientists in biopharma, cancer research, flow and mass cytometry core facilities and immunology and immuno-oncology academic institutions: How do cancer cells evade the immune system? Which cells and pathways are the best molecular targets? What is the mechanism of action for potential pharmaceuticals? How can we increase tumor immunogenicity? Which biomarkers could predict response? Which drugs offer the best treatment outcomes, and in what order of use?

Approaches based on immunotherapy are providing unprecedented benefits for cancer patients—most importantly, durable responses and complete remission at rates that far surpass conventional chemotherapy. The defining feature of immunotherapy is that T cells and other cell types in the immune system mediate the anticancer response. But immune system cells also promote adverse reactions in some immunotherapy patients. Monitoring T cells and other immune cells in these patients is important for drug development, understanding mechanisms of action and determining biomarkers that correlate with both response and adverse events.

 “Enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured. Using the unique power of mass cytometry, the immuno-oncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care.”
  —Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO, Fluidigm

The Maxpar® Human T Cell Immuno-Oncology EX Panel Kit—together with the Human T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kits—enables comprehensive identification of all major T cell subsets for determining activation, homing status and checkpoint molecule expression. Designed for use with mass cytometry, with capabilities for measuring more than 40 parameters per cell with little or no signal overlap, these panels reveal highly valuable information from even the most limited biological samples.

Modular configuration makes it easy to combine T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kits for flexible or complete coverage. Individual antibodies offer further customization for specific research needs. With access to a growing catalog of more than 600 commercially available preconjugated antibodies and custom conjugation options, the Maxpar panel system can be adapted to meet changing needs in cancer immunotherapy research.
  
A new industry standard

“The dynamic nature and inherent complexity of the antitumor immune response requires new approaches to deeply profile cell populations at single-cell resolution,” said Fluidigm President and CEO Chris Linthwaite. “This new set of multiparameter panels will empower more researchers with high-dimensional tools to interrogate the tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment, maximizing the information obtained from each precious sample.”

“Enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured,” Linthwaite added. “Using the unique power of mass cytometry, the immuno-oncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care.”

Mass cytometry is fast becoming an industry standard for deep cellular profiling in translational and clinical research. Referenced by hundreds of peer reviewed publications, mass cytometry expands beyond the inherent technical limitations of flow cytometry. With minimal spectral overlap, the technology enables researchers to interrogate more than 40 parameters simultaneously from millions of cells across both intracellular and extracellular protein markers.

Sample case study

As an example, The Journal of Immunology published a paper by Rituparna Das et al., “Combination therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 leads to distinct immunologic changes in vivo,” demonstrating highly multiplexed phenotyping of circulating immune cells to characterize immune response to individual and combination therapies. The report detailed the team’s experimental approach in a 45-patient cancer study at Yale University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Das and her collaborators used mass cytometry to perform multiparameter immunophenotyping of human PBMCs from patients before and after they were administered anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapy. Their customized 20-marker panel included the 16-marker Maxpar Human T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kit. They reported that the population of Ki-67+ cells increasing after anti-CTLA-4 or combination checkpoint blockade had a phenotype of CD45RO+, CCR7−, CD27+, CD28+ and CD95+, “consistent with transitional memory T cells.” These same proliferating cells also upregulated MHC class II HLA-DR.

Such deep profiling and identification of changes in this unique cell population would have been difficult using traditional approaches. Our new T cell immuno-oncology panel sets offer even deeper profiling than those used in the study cited above. Combining Maxpar T cell and immuno-oncology panels creates an unprecedented tool for profiling T cells. These panel sets also illustrate the power of mass cytometry as the premier platform for immune profiling and monitoring applications in translational and clinical research.

 Register for the 6th Annual Mass Cytometry Summit in Boston on June 9 to learn about recent insights made using mass cytometry and the Maxpar Human T Cell Immuno-Oncology EX Panel Kit.

Business model[edit]
Fluidigm's products leverage the capabilities of multilayer soft lithography to create microfluidic devices,[4] specifically technology developed by one of the co-founders and branded "Integrated Fluidic Circuitry".[5]
Fluidigm is a public company traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLDM.[6]
Fluidigm has a number of academic partners whose engagement is aimed to provide a wow factor to exemplar product uses; partners include Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Broad Institute, the Genome Institute of Singapore and Kyoto University.[1]
Among companies which include "integrated microfluidic technology" into their products, the only competitor which a market focus on biotechnology as of 2011 appeared to be RainDance Technologies.[3]
Going into 2015, the company is making an effort to infuse industrial design, aesthetic and customer centricity principles to help distinguish their products from those of competitors and generate a distinctive brand experience for users.[1]
History[edit]
Fluidigm was founded in 1999 as "Mycometrix" by Steve Quake and Gajus Worthington.[6][5] The company was formed to commercialize technology developed by Quake at the California Institute of Technology referred to as microfluidic large-scale integration and "branded" under the name Integrated Fluidic Circuits.[5] As of 2015, Worthington remains with the company as president and chief executive officer (CEO),[1] while Quake was a member of the company's scientific advisory board as of 2011.[5]
The company completed a successful initial public offering (IPO) in February 2011, raising about US$75,000,000.[6][7] This followed a failed, ill-timed IPO in 2008.[6] As of the 2011 IPO, Fluidigm had not yet become profitable, but had accumulated nearly US$200,000,000 in debt.[6]
Operations[edit]
At the end of 2014, Fluidigm had a headcount of 500 personnel.[1]
In addition to its headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco, California, which it expanded in 2014,[8] the company in 2005 established the first biochip manufacturing facility in Singapore.[2][5] The Singapore facility was in 2009 led by Grace Yow, who also held the position of Fluidigm vice president of worldwide manufacturing.[2]
Products[edit]
Fluidigm's products typically consist of single-use biochips, instrumentation for handling biochips and software for instrument operation and data collection and analysis.[2] No Fluidigm products had been approved for clinical use in the United States as of 2009.[2]
Fluidigm's first commercial product was aimed at the protein crystallization market and was launched in 2003 under the brand "Topaz".[5] The company's second marketed product targeted high-throughput DNA amplification and was launched in 2006 under the brand "BioMark".[5] By 2013, BioMark had been adapted to real-time PCR and was capable of running >9000 reactions in parallel.[9] A high-throughput genotyping system, FLUIDIGM EPI, was introduced in 2008.[5]
The C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep, or C1 system, was released in the early 2000s aimed at delivering 96 single-cell capture and processing events in parallel.[1] One aim of development forward from the C1 system is increasing parallel throughput.[1] This initial line of instruments purportedly cost about US$200,000 apiece to purchase in 2011.[6] One reported use for the instruments is "to identify signatures of induced pluripotent stem cells".[6]
Another product line was launched in late 2014 with an introductory instrument, an "imaging mass cytometer", on which subsequent products will be built.[1]

Fluidigm has a number of academic partners whose engagement is aimed to provide a wow factor to exemplar product uses; partners include Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Broad Institute, the Genome Institute of Singapore and Kyoto University.[1]
Among companies which include "integrated microfluidic technology" into their products, the only competitor which a market focus on biotechnology as of 2011 appeared to be RainDance Technologies.[3]
Going into 2015, the company is making an effort to infuse industrial design, aesthetic and customer centricity principles to help distinguish their products from those of competitors and generate a distinctive brand experience for users.[1]
History[edit]
Fluidigm was founded in 1999 as "Mycometrix" by Steve Quake and Gajus Worthington.[6][5] The company was formed to commercialize technology developed by Quake at the California Institute of Technology referred to as microfluidic large-scale integration and "branded" under the name Integrated Fluidic Circuits.[5] As of 2015, Worthington remains with the company as president and chief executive officer (CEO),[1] while Quake was a member of the company's scientific advisory board as of 2011.[5]
The company completed a successful initial public offering (IPO) in February 2011, raising about US$75,000,000.[6][7] This followed a failed, ill-timed IPO in 2008.[6] As of the 2011 IPO, Fluidigm had not yet become profitable, but had accumulated nearly US$200,000,000 in debt.[6]
Operations[edit]
At the end of 2014, Fluidigm had a headcount of 500 personnel.[1]
In addition to its headquarters and laboratory facility in South San Francisco, California, which it expanded in 2014,[8] the company in 2005 established the first biochip manufacturing facility in Singapore.[2][5] The Singapore facility was in 2009 led by Grace Yow, who also held the position of Fluidigm vice president of worldwide manufacturing.[2]
Products[edit]
Fluidigm's products typically consist of single-use biochips, instrumentation for handling biochips and software for instrument operation and data collection and analysis.[2] No Fluidigm products had been approved for clinical use in the United States as of 2009.[2]
Fluidigm's first commercial product was aimed at the protein crystallization market and was launched in 2003 under the brand "Topaz".[5] The company's second marketed product targeted high-throughput DNA amplification and was launched in 2006 under the brand "BioMark".[5] By 2013, BioMark had been adapted to real-time PCR and was capable of running >9000 reactions in parallel.[9] A high-throughput genotyping system, FLUIDIGM EPI, was introduced in 2008.[5]
The C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep, or C1 system, was released in the early 2000s aimed at delivering 96 single-cell capture and processing events in parallel.[1] One aim of development forward from the C1 system is increasing parallel throughput.[1] This initial line of instruments purportedly cost about US$200,000 apiece to purchase in 2011.[6] One reported use for the instruments is "to identify signatures of induced pluripotent stem cells".[6]
Another product line was launched in late 2014 with an introductory instrument, an "imaging mass cytometer", on which subsequent products will be built.[1]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

A Visionary Call to Action
Sonia Gavasso on the potential for mass cytometry to improve immunotherapy
Spotlight


































CYTO 2017 and the
 6th Annual Mass Cytometry Summit


Sonia Gavasso will be in Boston in June for CYTO® 2017 with colleagues presenting posters on mass cytometry and flow cytometry. “Our poster will be on MS and natalizumab (Tysabri®), a blocking antibody to alpha 4 integrin that the FDA approved in 2004 to treat relapsing MS.” She will also attend the 6th Annual Mass Cytometry Summit the day before CYTO: “I’ve been to the Mass Cytometry Summit several times, and I will go this time as well, absolutely. It’s amazing to meet all these people with so much know-how there.”

Researcher Sonia Gavasso, PhD, with the Neuroimmunology Lab at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, recently chatted with Fluidigm about the role of mass cytometry in her team’s cancer research. Gavasso anticipates that mass cytometry, or cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (the technology used in the CyTOF® system), will help to align diagnostics with current biological understandings of cancer, noting that monitoring therapies is key to making better decisions.

Defining immunotherapy approaches

There’s always talk about the importance of developing personalized therapies in the clinic, but she believes there should also be personalized monitoring. Fueling her work at University of Bergen through self-described fascination and love of science, Gavasso explained, “I have a passion for biology and an imagination for complexity. When I moved to Norway and joined the Haukeland University Hospital, I began studying immunology and central nervous system diseases, which are highly complex. That’s where mass cytometry comes in.”

In the Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics paper, “Single-cell proteomics: potential implications for cancer diagnostics,” Gavasso et al. issue an inspiring call for researchers to develop solutions addressing key problems in sustainable health care. “We believe new and emerging technologies will allow us to move from mostly empirical decisions to tailored treatments enabling fast and early decisions regarding response,” she said. “It would be the holy grail, even before treatment starts.”

In human medicine, it’s difficult to predict who will respond to an immunotherapy. The paper outlines an integral need for hands-on, simple technology to monitor response over time, rather than administering long-term treatment before differentiating between responders and nonresponders.

 “Mass cytometry has amazing potential. I don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’, but it’s close to it. This is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do.”
  —Sonia Gavasso, PhD, Neuroimmunology Lab, Haukeland University, Norway

Enter, Helios

Gavasso wanted to get a view of the immune system and how it behaves during therapy. “One out of three people die from cancer and it’s increasing, so something has to happen. There’s a real need for single-cell analysis technologies that revolutionize what we can do in research to translate into clinical diagnostics and monitoring. With CyTOF technology,” she continued, “we can go much deeper into whole system immunophenotyping to see where these medications actually work and where the antibody binds and has an effect. This is a completely new, holistic way to look at and monitor the immune system.”

When she heard about CyTOF technology in 2009, Gavasso remembered, some were skeptical, but she was thinking: “‘We should absolutely do this.’ I was fascinated and super excited about it.” She visited scientists in Paris who had a mass cytometer and recalled being amazed seeing it in action. “In Norway, they like established procedures and technologies so we had to wait a long time, but we didn’t give up.” Their Helios™ was a gift to the Haukeland University Hospital and University in Bergen funded through a Bergen Research Foundation grant.

“We now have a Helios system and it’s running really well. We have our own dedicated mass cytometry team here to take care of the system and run mass cytometry at the hospital where we collect lots of cells in clinical trials.” Gavasso holds great hopes for mass cytometry, citing around 20 major cryobanks collecting cell samples for mass cytometry applications in cancer, rheumatic, neurological and central nervous system diseases and advanced therapies like cryoimmunotherapy and stem cell transplantation. “We plan to get another Helios, and we look forward to being able to expand our mass cytometry capabilities with tissue imaging.”

Advantages over flow cytometry

The visualization in mass cytometry data is a major plus for Gavasso. “With mass cytometry, we’re finally getting a view of the elusive immune response in immune therapies. Disease systems are so complex. It’s super that we can look at a certain cell but not lose information about what other cell types are doing, or where they are within the immune system. That is absolutely unbelievable,” she said.

“Previously, this type of information was difficult to obtain in a single analysis with flow cytometry, and mass cytometry clearly expands our horizon,” she noted, “so we can monitor complexity.” Her team reported debulking in leukemia during kinase inhibitor treatment as early as seven days after starting. They also saw where a medicinal antibody binds and in which cell subtype. “It is unprecedented. We would not do this on the flow cytometer. There are too many tubes that are difficult to combine and need lots of controls.”

Gavasso gave the example of how medications come to the field after successful clinical trials, but how they actually work is often unknown, so researchers like her must rush to explain the mechanistic action. For her, mass cytometry is the technology to discover what immune-modulating compounds do in the immune system. “I am a believer,” she said. “Mass cytometry has amazing potential. I don’t want to use the word ‘revolutionize’, but it’s close to it. This is the first time we can clearly monitor the whole immune system for a really broad view of what’s going on and what we should do.”

Her lab in Bergen is currently running major Helios projects for which they’re collecting tissue and cell samples. For one study, they’re using Helios to monitor cryoimmunotherapy response in prostate cancer. Another involves developing stem cell transplant treatment approaches for MS and for leukemia using CyTOF technology to understand how the immune system reconstitutes after stem cell transplantation and immune ablation. The team is also studying graft versus host disease in cancer.

 “Mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using, it’s actually much, much better.”
  —Sonia Gavasso, PhD, Neuroimmunology Lab, Haukeland University, Norway

Papers in the pipeline

 Gavasso has a proof-of-principle chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) study of treatment with nilotinib (Tasigna®), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in press. “We’d see clear changes three hours after initiating therapy and debulking after one week in this ENEST1 clinical trial substudy.” The team has the opportunity to collect samples before therapy and again within hours of treatment because they work closely with treating physicians in their clinical trial units. “In treatment,” Gavasso explained, “those early tests provide valuable information, so we don’t have to wait a whole year before we can label them responders or nonresponders.”

Ultimately, Gavasso dreams of being able to analyze immune cells in the brain in nervous system diseases. “It’s difficult to collect samples from within the central nervous system. And if we do get them,” she said, “it would be really cool to have excellent technologies for analyzing samples at any level from RNA to DNA to proteomics.”

Bioinformatics approach

Gavasso has several applications for working collaboratively with bioinformaticians to analyze biological, programming, algorithmic and statistical data from Helios, independent of what’s published. Her group works closely with lab mathematicians on topology, studying spatial properties preserved through stretching, crumpling, bending and twisting of objects to verify methodological usability.

Cytobank is a boon, especially for studying the clinical dataset needed to integrate with information from the mass cytometer. “CyTOF technology is better than how we did things before in the clinic, when we had to always select cells and parameters. This is really exciting,” she added. “Mathematicians here in Bergen actually come to us now asking for datasets.”

A new perspective

Mass cytometry for higher-parameter analysis of precious samples offers a number of advantages. “Personally, I was excited to let go of the two-dimensional flow cytometry approach,” she said. “Mass cytometry is amazing, but some people find change difficult and are reluctant to go high-dimension, saying, ‘We’ve been doing things this way forever. It works, so why change now?’” Gavasso’s answer: “Mass cytometry is not just equal to the methods they’ve been using, it’s actually much, much better.”

   michaeline.bunting@fluidigm.com 

 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluidigm Corporation (NASDAQ:FLDM) today announced that leading research institutions in the UK have partnered to acquire and implement seven Helios™ mass cytometry systems to empower life-changing discoveries in human health. Supported by the Clinical Research Infrastructure Initiative (CRII) of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry includes researchers from the universities of Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Cambridge, Birmingham and Oxford and University College London.

 Helios utilizes CyTOF® technology to enable deep profiling of translational and clinical research samples across a range of cell surface and intracellular markers by mass cytometry. Designed to significantly reduce signal overlap, mass cytometry empowers researchers to simultaneously interrogate cellular phenotypes, function and signaling status in higher dimension than traditional fluorescent methods. Mass cytometry is especially valuable in research studies when sample volumes are limited.

 In support of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry, Fluidigm sponsored the 2017 UK Mass Cytometry User Meeting, a two-day symposium held in London on March 21 and 22. This meeting brought together scientists from 19 major UK research centers to share recent research advances and best practices in mass cytometry.

 "The Technology Directorate at Liverpool led the procurement and development of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry in the UK," said Professor Robert Beynon, PhD, academic head of the Technology Directorate at the University of Liverpool. "By organizing the UK users meeting, Fluidigm is helping to make this vision, of pooled knowledge and shared infrastructure, a reality."

 Symposium speakers included scientists from within the MRC consortium as well as mass cytometry users from other locations and technical specialists from Fluidigm. Topics included fundamentals of instrument operation and sample preparation, design of high-parameter biomarker panels, best practices for integrating mass cytometry into a core facility and cutting-edge research underway at several consortium locations.

 "My favorite aspects of the meeting were being able to hear and discuss how the different groups associated with the consortium (and indeed other mass cytometry users outside the consortium) have developed and use the technology for different aspects of research, and also how they have adapted mass cytometry within their core service providers for wider use by their universities," said Joseph Slupsky, PhD, academic lead for the University of Liverpool Cell Sorting and Mass Cytometry Facility.

 Dr. Slupsky's research is focused on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). "I am using mass cytometry to measure phenotypic changes, signal transduction and gene expression within distinct subpopulations of CLL cells," Dr. Slupsky said. "Mass cytometry will also be used to understand patient response to drug therapy in this disease and gain insight into the mechanisms of drug toxicity and efficacy."

 "We are enthusiastic about the collective power of the MRC Consortium for Mass Cytometry to achieve new breakthroughs in an environment of shared infrastructure and best practices," said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO of Fluidigm. "The great progress these institutions have made since the successful installation of these seven systems was evident at our recent UK user meeting."

The promising field of immuno-oncology presents many unanswered questions for scientists in biopharma, cancer research, flow and mass cytometry core facilities and immunology and immuno-oncology academic institutions: How do cancer cells evade the immune system? Which cells and pathways are the best molecular targets? What is the mechanism of action for potential pharmaceuticals? How can we increase tumor immunogenicity? Which biomarkers could predict response? Which drugs offer the best treatment outcomes, and in what order of use?

Approaches based on immunotherapy are providing unprecedented benefits for cancer patients—most importantly, durable responses and complete remission at rates that far surpass conventional chemotherapy. The defining feature of immunotherapy is that T cells and other cell types in the immune system mediate the anticancer response. But immune system cells also promote adverse reactions in some immunotherapy patients. Monitoring T cells and other immune cells in these patients is important for drug development, understanding mechanisms of action and determining biomarkers that correlate with both response and adverse events.

 “Enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured. Using the unique power of mass cytometry, the immuno-oncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care.”

The Maxpar® Human T Cell Immuno-Oncology EX Panel Kit—together with the Human T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kits—enables comprehensive identification of all major T cell subsets for determining activation, homing status and checkpoint molecule expression. Designed for use with mass cytometry, with capabilities for measuring more than 40 parameters per cell with little or no signal overlap, these panels reveal highly valuable information from even the most limited biological samples.

Modular configuration makes it easy to combine T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kits for flexible or complete coverage. Individual antibodies offer further customization for specific research needs. With access to a growing catalog of more than 600 commercially available preconjugated antibodies and custom conjugation options, the Maxpar panel system can be adapted to meet changing needs in cancer immunotherapy research.
  
A new industry standard

“The dynamic nature and inherent complexity of the antitumor immune response requires new approaches to deeply profile cell populations at single-cell resolution,” said Fluidigm President and CEO Chris Linthwaite. “This new set of multiparameter panels will empower more researchers with high-dimensional tools to interrogate the tumor immune response and the tumor microenvironment, maximizing the information obtained from each precious sample.”

“Enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumors has tremendous potential to change the way cancer is treated and eventually cured,” Linthwaite added. “Using the unique power of mass cytometry, the immuno-oncology research community can identify new biomarkers and optimize the development of new cancer immunotherapies to fully realize the potential of this transformative approach to cancer care.”

Mass cytometry is fast becoming an industry standard for deep cellular profiling in translational and clinical research. Referenced by hundreds of peer reviewed publications, mass cytometry expands beyond the inherent technical limitations of flow cytometry. With minimal spectral overlap, the technology enables researchers to interrogate more than 40 parameters simultaneously from millions of cells across both intracellular and extracellular protein markers.

Sample case study

As an example, The Journal of Immunology published a paper by Rituparna Das et al., “Combination therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 leads to distinct immunologic changes in vivo,” demonstrating highly multiplexed phenotyping of circulating immune cells to characterize immune response to individual and combination therapies. The report detailed the team’s experimental approach in a 45-patient cancer study at Yale University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Das and her collaborators used mass cytometry to perform multiparameter immunophenotyping of human PBMCs from patients before and after they were administered anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade therapy. Their customized 20-marker panel included the 16-marker Maxpar Human T Cell Phenotyping Panel Kit. They reported that the population of Ki-67+ cells increasing after anti-CTLA-4 or combination checkpoint blockade had a phenotype of CD45RO+, CCR7−, CD27+, CD28+ and CD95+, “consistent with transitional memory T cells.” These same proliferating cells also upregulated MHC class II HLA-DR.

Such deep profiling and identification of changes in this unique cell population would have been difficult using traditional approaches. Our new T cell immuno-oncology panel sets offer even deeper profiling than those used in the study cited above. Combining Maxpar T cell and immuno-oncology panels creates an unprecedented tool for profiling T cells. These panel sets also illustrate the power of mass cytometry as the premier platform for immune profiling and monitoring applications in translational and clinical research.
