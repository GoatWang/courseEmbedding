Under the new contract, CSG will continue to provide a comprehensive set of customer care and billing solutions. In addition, Charter will deploy CSG Workforce Express for field service management, scheduling, dispatch, automation and mobile technician support.
CSG International (NASDAQ: CSGS) is the trusted global partner to help clients launch and monetize communications and entertainment services in the digital age.

Udall Demands Assurances from Pai on Fair Treatment, Regulation of Media
After Trump attacks and trend of violence against media, Udall presses FCC chairman to speak up & protect press freedom
WASHINGTON -- Today, during a Commerce Committee confirmation hearing for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai and two other FCC Commission nominees, U.S. Senator Tom Udall pressed Pai about his previous lack of full-throated commitment to regulating the media in a fair and impartial matter, in light of the Trump administration's repeated attacks on media organizations and threats to punish media outlets for their reporting. Udall also raised his serious concerns about recent instances of violence against the media - including an FCC security guard man-handling a journalist -- questioned Pai's response to these events, and urged him to speak out against violence and intimidation tactics used against journalists.
President Trump "has continued his unprecedented and dangerous attacks on media organizations that report stories that he does not like," said Udall, citing a litany of examples. On June 28th, the president tweeted "The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!" Udall said that "many people viewed this tweet as a threat by the president of the United States to pursue higher taxes against a company in retaliation for negative news coverage. That's just outrageous." Udall also cited a New York Times report that said, "White House advisers have discussed a potential point of leverage over their adversary... a pending merger between CNN's parent company, Time Warner, and AT&T." In regards to this pending merger, Udall quoted then-candidate Trump as saying "AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few."
Udall then raised another major media merger pending before the FCC - the proposed acquisition of the Tribune Company by Sinclair Broadcasting. "There are real concerns that this merger would violate media ownership rules. But the FCC has already helped pave the way for this merger by reinstating the so-called 'UHF discount' that enables TV companies to get bigger. Sinclair now requires all their local stations to air video commentary pieces by a former Trump administration staffer who generally support the Trump administration. Sinclair's CEO has also been quite complimentary of you personally."
"The contrasting approach here creates the very real perception that the Trump administration would act to reward friendly coverage and punish negative coverage," Udall said, pointing out that Pai himself has been "hesitant to answer direct questions about the president's attacks against FCC regulated media companies that have reported stories critical of the administration." He asked Pai to pledge to exercise his authority as chairman of the FCC to regulate the media in an impartial manner, to which Pai replied that he would. Udall also asked Pai if he has had any communications with the White House, directly or through an intermediary, regarding any media regulatory issues since March, to which Pai replied that he has not, nor is he aware that he or his staff have been communicated to by White House intermediaries. Finally, Udall asked Pai if he believes it "is appropriate for any federal official with power over media organizations to attack or threaten them with legal or regulatory retaliation over negative media coverage." Pai did not directly answer the question, though he committed that he himself "will not do so."
Udall has repeatedly raised concerns about whether Pai has been fully committed to press freedom. In one of the most disturbing examples, FCC security man-handled CQ reporter John Donnelly and pinned him against a wall after he sought to ask questions of Commissioner Michael O'Rielly. Udall and U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H) sent a letter to Pai demanding answers, to which Pai responded in writing, saying he agreed the incident was inexcusable. But Udall has said he remains concerned that many of the details of the event were not fully explained.
Udall again raised the issue today, asking Pai and the other two nominees, former Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel and current FCC General Counsel Brendan Carr about the response to the spike in violence and intimidation against individual journalists, including the FCC security incident. "Will you commit to speak out against violence and intimidation against reporters--and commit that you personally will set a good example for press access into your own public activities?" Udall asked, and Pai, Rosenworcel, and Carr all said they would.
Since President Trump took office and elevated Pai to chairman, Udall has repeatedly sought assurances from Pai that he will stand up for press freedom as the leader of the FCC. In March, Udall asked Pai if he agreed with President Trump that the media is an "enemy of the American people," but Pai refused to answer. Udall and Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee followed up with a letter to Pai demanding answers about his positions on press freedom and his ability to be an independent regulator of the media.

 CSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (NASDAQ:CSGS) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Summary of Material Definitive Agreement.CSG Systems International, Inc. (“CSG”) currently generates a material portion of its revenues from Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”), which acquired Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner”) in May 2016.In connection with the acquisition, the Time Warner Master Subscriber Management Agreement (the “Time Warner Agreement”) was assigned to Charter.The combined Charter/Time Warner revenues represented approximately 21% of CSG’s total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, making Charter CSG’s second largest client.
CSG’s existing agreement with Charter runs through December 31, 2019.The Time Warner Agreement, which covers the Time Warner customer accounts serviced by CSG and now owned by Charter, was originally set to expire on March 31, 2017, but was extended for additional one-month periods through July 31, 2017, while the parties continued negotiations related to a new long-term Charter Consolidated Master Subscriber Management System Agreement that would provide CSG products and services covering both Time Warner and Charter customer accounts under one master agreement.
On July 17, 2017, CSG entered into a new Consolidated CSG Master Subscriber Management System Agreement with Charter (the “New Agreement”) which supersedes all previous agreements with Charter and Time Warner. 
The key terms and conditions of the New Agreement are as follows:
      The New Agreement is effective August 1, 2017 and extends CSG’s contractual relationship with Charter (an additional 2 years), and additionally covers the Time Warner customer accounts serviced by CSG and now owned by Charter (an additional 4.5 years) through December 31, 2021.In addition, Charter has the option to extend the New Agreement for an additional one-year term.         Consistent with the previous agreements, the fees to be generated under the New Agreement will be based primarily on monthly per unit charges for our cloud and related solution, and other various ancillary services. Certain of the per-unit fees include volume-based pricing tiers, and are subject to annual inflationary price escalators.         The New Agreement includes incentives for Charter to convert additional customer accounts onto CSG’s Advanced Convergent Platform (“ACP”) customer care and billing solution.         The New Agreement includes minimum commitments for the number of Charter customer accounts to be serviced on ACP.         The New Agreement contains certain rights and obligations of both parties, including the following key items: (i) the termination of the Agreement under certain conditions; (ii) various service level commitments; and (iii) remedies and limitation on liabilities associated with specified breaches of contractual obligations.   Under the New Agreement, CSG provided Charter a pricing discount in-line with the extended contract term through December 31, 2021, and the roll out of additional products and services by Charter. As a result, CSG expects its revenues from Charter under the New Agreement to be relatively consistent on a go forward basis. 
The anticipated revenue impact in both the near and long terms may vary depending on the actual level of products and services consumed by Charter. The revenue impact from the New Agreement is only an estimate and actual results may vary depending upon a variety of factors. CSG undertakes no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CSG wishes to ensure that such forward-looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, so as to ensure to the fullest extent possible, the protections of the safe harbor established in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Risk Factors Related to Forward-Looking Statements” below for additional discussions on forward-looking statements.
A copy of this amendment, with confidential information redacted, will be filed as an exhibit to CSG’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
Risk Factors Related to Forward-Looking Statements. This report contains forward-looking statements (as defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) relative to expectations concerning CSG’s business. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward-looking statements. CSG is subject to risk in its business generally, or the New Agreement specifically. Readers are therefore encouraged to review CSG’s risk factors and related information as described in CSG’s reports on Forms 10-K and10-Q and other filings made with the SEC.

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

 CSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (NASDAQ:CSGS) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Summary of Material Definitive Agreement.CSG Systems International, Inc. (“CSG”) currently generates a material portion of its revenues from Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”), which acquired Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner”) in May 2016.In connection with the acquisition, the Time Warner Master Subscriber Management Agreement (the “Time Warner Agreement”) was assigned to Charter.The combined Charter/Time Warner revenues represented approximately 21% of CSG’s total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, making Charter CSG’s second largest client.
CSG’s existing agreement with Charter runs through December 31, 2019.The Time Warner Agreement, which covers the Time Warner customer accounts serviced by CSG and now owned by Charter, was originally set to expire on March 31, 2017, but was extended for additional one-month periods through July 31, 2017, while the parties continued negotiations related to a new long-term Charter Consolidated Master Subscriber Management System Agreement that would provide CSG products and services covering both Time Warner and Charter customer accounts under one master agreement.
On July 17, 2017, CSG entered into a new Consolidated CSG Master Subscriber Management System Agreement with Charter (the “New Agreement”) which supersedes all previous agreements with Charter and Time Warner. 
The key terms and conditions of the New Agreement are as follows:
      The New Agreement is effective August 1, 2017 and extends CSG’s contractual relationship with Charter (an additional 2 years), and additionally covers the Time Warner customer accounts serviced by CSG and now owned by Charter (an additional 4.5 years) through December 31, 2021.In addition, Charter has the option to extend the New Agreement for an additional one-year term.         Consistent with the previous agreements, the fees to be generated under the New Agreement will be based primarily on monthly per unit charges for our cloud and related solution, and other various ancillary services. Certain of the per-unit fees include volume-based pricing tiers, and are subject to annual inflationary price escalators.         The New Agreement includes incentives for Charter to convert additional customer accounts onto CSG’s Advanced Convergent Platform (“ACP”) customer care and billing solution.         The New Agreement includes minimum commitments for the number of Charter customer accounts to be serviced on ACP.         The New Agreement contains certain rights and obligations of both parties, including the following key items: (i) the termination of the Agreement under certain conditions; (ii) various service level commitments; and (iii) remedies and limitation on liabilities associated with specified breaches of contractual obligations.   Under the New Agreement, CSG provided Charter a pricing discount in-line with the extended contract term through December 31, 2021, and the roll out of additional products and services by Charter. As a result, CSG expects its revenues from Charter under the New Agreement to be relatively consistent on a go forward basis. 
The anticipated revenue impact in both the near and long terms may vary depending on the actual level of products and services consumed by Charter. The revenue impact from the New Agreement is only an estimate and actual results may vary depending upon a variety of factors. CSG undertakes no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CSG wishes to ensure that such forward-looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, so as to ensure to the fullest extent possible, the protections of the safe harbor established in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See “Risk Factors Related to Forward-Looking Statements” below for additional discussions on forward-looking statements.
A copy of this amendment, with confidential information redacted, will be filed as an exhibit to CSG’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
Risk Factors Related to Forward-Looking Statements. This report contains forward-looking statements (as defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) relative to expectations concerning CSG’s business. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward-looking statements. CSG is subject to risk in its business generally, or the New Agreement specifically. Readers are therefore encouraged to review CSG’s risk factors and related information as described in CSG’s reports on Forms 10-K and10-Q and other filings made with the SEC.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
The following information is furnished  to Item 7.01 (Regulation FD Disclosure). This information shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
On July 19, 2017, CSG issued a press release announcing that CSG had entered into a new agreement with Charter. A copy of the press release is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated into this section by reference.

NASDAQ:CSGS 







  "We are extremely pleased with Comcast’s decision to expand its        relationship with CSG" 



ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CSG Systems International, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGS), a global provider of 
      interactive transaction-driven solutions and services, today announced 
      that it has expanded and extended its relationship with Comcast Cable to 
      provide residential billing services through June 30, 2019.
    

      Currently, CSG provides its end-to-end, pre-integrated customer care and 
      billing solution to approximately two-thirds of Comcast’s existing 
      residential customers. The expanded contract provides the framework for 
      Comcast to consolidate its residential business onto CSG’s billing 
      solution. Initially under the new agreement, Comcast plans to add 
      approximately 2.3 million residential customers onto the CSG billing 
      solution in early 2015, with the opportunity for additional customer 
      account migrations to CSG as part of any future consolidation or 
      standardization.
    

      “We are extremely pleased with Comcast’s decision to expand its 
      relationship with CSG,” said Peter Kalan, president and chief executive 
      officer of CSG International. “This is the result of 20 years of hard 
      work, operational excellence and intercompany cooperation as Comcast has 
      evolved to one of the premier providers of content and communications in 
      the new digital era. Through the years, we have enjoyed the opportunity 
      to work side-by-side as Comcast has launched new products and services 
      aimed at giving the customer more choice and control.”
    

      “As we continue to innovate and bring new products and services to 
      market, we want to make it easier for customers to interact with us,” 
      said Scott Alcott, chief information officer for Comcast Cable. “CSG has 
      been a great partner and this new agreement will help us provide more 
      consistent customer interactions by creating opportunities to 
      standardize and streamline our back-office operations.”
    

Conference Call:


      CSG will host a conference call on July 31, 2014, at 5:00 p.m. ET, to 
      discuss today’s announcement. The call will be carried live and archived 
      on the Internet. A link to the conference call and the accompanying 
      slides is available at http://ir.csgi.com/.
    

      In addition, to reach the conference by phone, dial 1-888-287-5563 and 
      ask the operator for the CSG International conference call and Liz 
      Bauer, chairperson. A replay of the conference call will also be 
      available until 6:00 p.m. ET on August 30, 2014, and can be accessed by 
      calling 1-888-203-1112 and access code of 6899300.

Forward-Looking Statements


Certain statements in this communication regarding the potential 
      processing of non-CSG customer accounts onto the CSG billing platform, 
      including any statements regarding the expected timetable for completing 
      any such conversions and their financial impact for CSG, and any other 
      statements regarding CSG’s future expectations, beliefs, plans, 
      objectives, financial projections, assumptions or future events that are 
      not historical in nature are “forward-looking” statements made within 
      the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


      These statements are often, but not always, made through use of words or 
      phrases such as “may”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “could”, “should”, 
      “intend”, “plan”, “will”, “expect(s)”, “estimate(s)”, “project(s)”, 
      “forecast(s)”, “positioned”, “strategy”, “outlook” and similar 
      expressions. All such forward-looking statements involve estimates and 
      assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results 
      expressed in the statements.
    

      Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from those contained in the forward-looking statements are the 
      following: the timing of any migrations of customer accounts to CSG’s 
      billing platform; the risk with both parties’ abilities to efficiently 
      and effectively migrate customer accounts from other billing platforms 
      onto the CSG platform; the risk that Comcast will execute on its 
      currently planned intentions to consolidate and standardize its 
      operations in the future; and the potential adverse impact of continued 
      service provider consolidation within the communications industry.
    

      The factors listed above are in no way intended to be a complete or 
      exhaustive list of all the risks associated with our relationship with 
      Comcast. Readers are encouraged to read additional information 
      concerning these and other factors can be found in CSG’s respective 
      filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Reports on Form 
      10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We 
      assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers 
      are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements that speak only as of the date hereof.
    

      For more information regarding the expanded and extended contract with 
      Comcast Cable, please refer to the Form 8-K filed today with the SEC, 
      which can be found on the investor relations page of the company’s 
      website.
