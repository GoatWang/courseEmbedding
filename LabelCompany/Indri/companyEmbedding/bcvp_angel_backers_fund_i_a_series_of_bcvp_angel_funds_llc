Reg D Rule 506(b) Versus 506(c)


 
Written by 


			Fundingtree Support        

 on  

May 16, 2016
  


Rule 506 (b) Versus 506 (c)Rule 506 of Regulation D is considered a "safe harbor" for the private offering exemption ofSection 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Companies relying on the Rule 506 exemption can raise an unlimited amount of money. There are actually two distinct exemptions that fall under Rule 506.  

 
 
1












Rule 506 (b)

Under Rule 506(b), a company can be assured it is within the Section 4(a)(2) exemption by satisfying the following standards:

The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities;
The company may sell its securities to an unlimited number of "accredited investors" and up to 35 other purchases. Unlike Rule 505, all non-accredited investors, either alone or with a purchaser representative, must be sophisticated—that is, they must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment;
Companies must decide what information to give to accredited investors, so long as it does not violate the antifraud prohibitions of the federal securities laws. But companies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents that are generally the same as those used in registered offerings. If a company provides information to accredited investors, it must make this information available to non-accredited investors as well;
The company must be available to answer questions by prospective purchasers; and
Financial statement requirements are the same as for Rule 505.



Rule 506 (c)

Under Rule 506(c), a company can broadly solicit and generally advertise the offering, but still be deemed to be undertaking a private offering within Section 4(a)(2) if:

The investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and
The company has taken reasonable steps to verify that its investors are accredited investors, which could include reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and brokerage statements, credit reports and the like.

Purchasers of securities offered pursuant to Rule 506 receive "restricted" securities, meaning that the securities cannot be sold for at least a year without registering them.
Companies relying on the Rule 506 exemption do not have to register their offering of securities with the SEC, but they must file what is known as a "Form D" electronically with the SEC after they first sell their securities. Form D is a brief notice that includes the names and addresses of the company’s promoters, executive officers and directors, and some details about the offering, but contains little other information about the company.  If you are thinking about investing in a Regulation D offering, you should obtain a copy of the company’s Form D available from theEDGAR database.

 10 takeaways from Bull City Venture Partners' annual investor and entrepreneur event in Raleigh

Considering a slow-down in venture funding last year, a political environment with many unknowns and yet, the Dow Jones at a record high, it was hard to know what to expect from yesterday’s annual venture outlook by Durham venture capital firm Bull City Venture Partners.
I can best sum it up as a mixed bag.
Investors on a pair of panels seemed expectant that M&A activity will accelerate in 2017, IPOs may happen in greater frequency and early stage and series A capital will still be plentiful for companies with the best teams and product market fit.
And yet, companies overvalued in 2014 and 2015 are still taking down rounds or shutting down. Both institutional funds and angels are investing more money in fewer companies. And entrepreneurs are still making the same mistakes in pitching—not knowing the competition, lacking data to back up their assumptions, seeking too much money or setting unrealistic valuations.
Investor Anthony Pompliano told the crowd that 80 percent of the entrepreneurs in the room should shut their companies down and get a job.
So what should entrepreneurs do considering the landscape? In a lot of ways, the advice from both panels was back to basics. Here are some key takeaways:
Know who you’re pitching
The Charleston Angel Partners have just over 50 members who have interest in solutions to large market problems. They want to see traction and a path to revenue. Venture South presents deals to 10 angel groups around the southeast, a majority of which have focus on enterprise software, life science and industrial manufacturing.
Full Tilt Capital wants to be in a deal as early as possible. That often means pre revenue and sometimes pre product if the team is good and plan is specific and feasible enough.
Valor Ventures has a trio of founders with a range of abilities—one is an engineer and former CIO at Samsung with 15 patents, another with 15 years of experience in M&A at GE, and the third with a decade of experience operating and scaling tech companies. Hyper growth SaaS companies are their focus, and they know what they’re seeing from the engineering, financial and operational perspectives.
Know the landscape
Accel’s Alex Estevez gave a 26-slide presentation on the technology landscape for 2017 and beyond. It’s helpful to know what historical influences and macroeconomic trends might plan into your company’s trajectory, whether fundraising, scaling in a certain industry sector or pursuing an exit.
 
  Accel Connect 2016 talk for portfolio founders & CEOs  from Accel 
Know what your investors expect
Full Tilt expects a plan in place to accelerate growth in the next 90 days. That can mean any number of things, but other portfolio companies have gone from 9,000 users to 100,000, grown revenue 12x or signed four $700,000 deals in that time frame.
A Citrix investment doesn’t require a board seat but it typically means you’ll get access to Citrix as a partner or customer, and it wants first of refusal to acquire if offers start coming in, says Mike Cristinziano, who lives in Raleigh but vets and makes deals for the corporation nationally.
“We try to be a champion of that company,” Cristinziano says. “Partner with us more and succeed.”
The Charleston Angel Partners expect to participate in follow-on rounds after making an initial investment in a company. Once in, they want to be along for the ride.
Set milestones, hit them and share them
Investors want to see a plan in action. Pompliano compares startups to video games. Founders should be focused on advancing to the next level versus beating the game. Investors suggest updating them regularly on progress so they can see a trajectory of growth.
“Your job is to build credibility at every step in the process,” says Matt Dunbar of VentureSouth.
Matt Dunbar of VentureSouth, Anthony Pompliano of Full Tilt Capital and John Osborne of Charleston Venture Partners talk angel investments with David Jones of Bull City Venture Partners.
Trends do and don’t matter
There seems to be an investor for anything. Some might be focused on certain verticals, industries or technologies. Others just want a great idea with a team with the passion, skill and determination to make it happen.
Pompliano’s fund, for example, doesn’t follow trends at all (though he admits interest in finding a viable genetic nutrition company). HIs investments range from a stiletto heel company to app intelligence to “hard core biotech.”
Have a plan for growing the business without raising capital
Money isn’t always there when you need it. And the time you spend fundraising might be better spent building your product. Estevez said it best: “Build a business where you’re not dependent on us and you’ll find out we love you.”
If you do have to raise money, Lisa Calhoun of Valor Ventures suggests getting creative with terms. Though they have more money, funds and angels are doing 25 percent fewer deals, she says. You have to really stand out, and be willing to negotiate.
Know your competition
This seems obvious, but too many founder pitch their businesses and gloss over the competition or fail to account for competitors globally. Mark Rostick of Intel Capital says startups need to know very clearly what makes them unique from or better than competitors. And global scope is important.
“We invest in world class companies—we happen to live in this region. When you come to us, show us you have that kind of perspective on what you’re doing,” he says.
The VC panel at BCVP’s Entrepreneurs Series event included Lisa Calhoun of Valor Ventures, Cristinziano of Citrix, Alex Estevez of Accel and Mark Rostick of Intel Capital. Jason Caplain of BCVP, left, moderated the panel.
Get to know corporates in your space
If you’ve watched the stock market and read quarterly earnings reports, you know that corporations are flush with cash. Most would rather pay for innovation rather than do it themselves. So you can only expect more acquisitions, or as the VC shared on the panels, “platform roll ups” of startups in various niches related to the corporate’s core offerings.
If acquisition is your end game, or it makes sense to exit rather than raise a series B or C, consider getting to know the mainline companies in your industry.
Culture matters
Companies must add process and systems over time to keep up with the fast growth of their team, but culture has to remain important all along. Estevez uses the example of Mark Zuckerberg, who 10 years ago was attending Accel’s annual summits and now has a top five valued company in the world. The ability to grow rapidly, Estevez says, comes from Facebook’s investment in its culture.
Be dogged
Estevez pointed out that determination is really key to success in building a startup. “There are so many examples of 10-year overnight successes,” he says. Expressing respect for the founders out there working hard every day, he encouraged them to ignore the high valuations and unicorn companies and instead focus on solving problems.
“The most overriding successes have valued persistence and doggedness to make it work,” Estevez says.

Yelp



Yelp was founded in San Francisco in July 2004 to connect people to great local businesses. We became Yelp's first institutional investor in 2005. Shortly after our investment, Yelp's team of about a dozen people moved into a shuttered stereo store on San Francisco's Mission street. The location had an unexpected upside: Yelp board meetings took place in a padded room once used to demo loud set ups, which ensured that those confidential conversations would not be overheard. Today, that seems like ancient history. Yelp went public in 2012 (NYSE: YELP) and now has active communities in 32 countries around the world.  With more than 90 million rich, local reviews, Yelp is the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists.

Periscope changed how we see the world.  Periscope is a live video streaming app developed by Kayvon Beykpour and Joe Bernstein.  The idea for Periscope was born in 2013, as Kayvon traveled abroad. He was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He turned to Twitter for real-time updates but, while he could read about the protests, he was frustrated not to see them. Motivated by that experience, Kayvon and Joe started the company in February 2014.  Two months later, we provided seed capital to fund development of the app. Before launching their product, Periscope was acquired by Twitter (January 2015).   Periscope was launched in March 2015 and now has over 10 million registered users and 40 years of video watched per day.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
