CENTCOM oversees 250,000 US troops. Abizaid succeeded General Tommy Franks as Commander, USCENTCOM, on July 7, 2003, and was also elevated to the rank of four-star general the same week. He was succeeded by Admiral William J. Fallon on March 16, 2007.
Abizaid retired from the military on May 1, 2007 after 34 years of service.[1] As of 2007, Abizaid is employed as a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[2] He assumed the Distinguished Chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point in December 2007.

Early life and education[edit]
A Lebanese American, Abizaid was born in northern California in 1951. His grandparents had immigrated to California from southern Lebanon during the late 19th century.[5] He was raised Roman Catholic.[5] His father, a Navy machinist in World War II, raised him after Abizaid's mother died of cancer.[5]
Abizaid's military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid's 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master's student he has kept, saying, "It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.[6]
Career[edit]

Abizaid was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge.
Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.
His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the “Big Red One,” in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.
Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks.
On December 20, 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld.[7] On March 16, 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as Commander, U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.
On September 8, 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Abizaid is married[5] and has three children.[5] He learned Arabic in the military.[5]
Global War on Terrorism speech[edit]
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.[9]
2006–2007 comments on Iraq[edit]
On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]

Early life and education[edit]
A Lebanese American, Abizaid was born in northern California in 1951. His grandparents had immigrated to California from southern Lebanon during the late 19th century.[5] He was raised Roman Catholic.[5] His father, a Navy machinist in World War II, raised him after Abizaid's mother died of cancer.[5]
Abizaid's military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid's 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master's student he has kept, saying, "It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.[6]
Career[edit]

Abizaid was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge.
Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.
His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the “Big Red One,” in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.
Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks.
On December 20, 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld.[7] On March 16, 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as Commander, U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.
On September 8, 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Abizaid is married[5] and has three children.[5] He learned Arabic in the military.[5]
Global War on Terrorism speech[edit]
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.[9]
2006–2007 comments on Iraq[edit]
On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]

Early life and education[edit]
A Lebanese American, Abizaid was born in northern California in 1951. His grandparents had immigrated to California from southern Lebanon during the late 19th century.[5] He was raised Roman Catholic.[5] His father, a Navy machinist in World War II, raised him after Abizaid's mother died of cancer.[5]
Abizaid's military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid's 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master's student he has kept, saying, "It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.[6]
Career[edit]

Abizaid was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge.
Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.
His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the “Big Red One,” in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.
Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks.
On December 20, 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld.[7] On March 16, 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as Commander, U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.
On September 8, 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Abizaid is married[5] and has three children.[5] He learned Arabic in the military.[5]
Global War on Terrorism speech[edit]
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.[9]
2006–2007 comments on Iraq[edit]
On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]

					General Abizaid's Biography									





 John P. Abizaid retired from the United States Army after thirty-four years, during which he rose from infantry platoon leader to four-star general in the United States Army and became the longest-serving commander of United States Central Command. Equally respected by troops in the field and international leaders, during a distinguished and storied career he commanded at every level, with unique and challenging assignments ranging from infantry combat to delicate international negotiations. He studied and often served in the Middle East, and is widely considered to be an expert in the field of Middle Eastern affairs. During a period of unprecedented challenges to the security of the United States and its allies, he was one of the first to recognize the protracted nature of the conflict against religious-inspired extremists, and in response he reorganized the theatre to fight what he termed “The Long War”, a regional struggle unmatched for its complexity and the durability of its problems.As the Combatant Commander of United States Central Command, he was responsible for military strategy and joint operations in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia. Serving fifty-four months in combat zones both as Deputy Commander (Forward), and as the Combatant Commander, he led simultaneous international coalitions that operated in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and the Persian Gulf. He worked to advance enhancement of regional military, counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency capabilities in order to help the nations of the region help themselves against the many threats to stability they face.At the same time, he was responsible for all military operations and activities in twenty-seven nations in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia, which included protection of the sea lanes in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, operations against piracy in the Arabian Sea, and support of countries throughout the region such as Yemen, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, for example, as they confront local and regional extremism. Concurrently, he oversaw humanitarian operations such as relief for earthquake victims in Iran and Pakistan, and evacuation of American citizens from Lebanon prior to and during the Israeli-Hezbollah border conflict in 2006.Before his assignments at Central Command, General Abizaid served as the ranking three-star officer on the Joint Staff as the Director of the Joint Staff. In this position he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Staff, developing military advice for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense on personnel, intelligence, current operations, plans and policy, communications, budget and future requirements issues. During his tenure as Director, the Joint Staff advised the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense on the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks, homeland security issues, and all military operations worldwide.Prior to his appointment as the Director, General Abizaid served on the Joint Staff as the Director of Plans and Policy, J-5, responsible for US military strategic planning and interagency policy coordination. After the attacks of September 11, he was responsible for initiating and coordinating the rapid interagency and international response for the Joint Staff.Prior to his tours on the Joint Staff, General Abizaid served as Commanding General of the First Infantry Division, “The Big Red One”, headquartered in Wurzburg, Germany, which deployed the first ground forces into Kosovo with NATO’s Task Force Falcon and patrolled the streets and countryside of Kosovo until June 2000. From July 1997 to August 1999 General Abizaid served as the 66th Commandant of Cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point. During his tenure, he revamped the military curriculum, reduced hazing rituals, and emphasized realistic military training and leadership principles. The leaders he trained serve today on battlefields around the world.Prior to his assignment at West Point, General Abizaid served as Assistant Division Commander, First Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first military formation to arrive there to enforce the provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord.In his earlier career, General Abizaid commanded Ranger Companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, commanding the latter during the parachute assault on Grenada in 1983, during which a small unit attack he led provided the inspiration for an incident shown in the Clint Eastwood film Heartbreak Ridge. He also commanded the 325th Airborne Battalion Combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, which deployed under his command to Northern Iraq in 1991, tasked with providing a safe haven for the Kurdish population, and the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, which was designated the lead attack element in the aborted invasion of Haiti in 1995. He served as the Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, as a special assistant to General Max Thurman, Vice Chief of Staff, US Army, and in the United Nations as both an observer and Operations Officer for Observer Group Lebanon in 1985-86.General Abizaid graduated from the United States Military Academy with a BS in 1973. His military education, in addition to infantry basic and advanced courses, includes the Armed Forces Staff College and an Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. His civilian studies include an Olmsted Scholarship at the University of Jordan, Amman, and a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University.General Abizaid is a highly decorated officer who has been awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star. He holds military honors from numerous nations including: Germany, France, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Australia, Afghanistan and Egypt.General Abizaid was named the first Annenberg Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University in May, 2007. He holds the Distinguished Chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He works with the Preventative Defense Project at Stanford University and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. He regularly speaks on leadership and international security through the Washington Speakers Bureau. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and serves as a Director of the George and Carol Olmsted Foundation. He is a member of the Board of Directors for USAA and RPM, Inc. Through JPA Partners, LLC, General Abizaid provides strategic and analytic consulting services to corporate, non-profit, international and government clients.

Tabitha Keating / Special to The R-C |Retired Gen. John P. Abizaid, former U.S. CENTCOM commander, addresses an audience Sunday night during the Douglas County Republicans' "We the People"...John AbizaidPrev of  imagesNext

Retired Gen. John Abizaid shared some light moments — as well as some serious ones — with a near-capacity audience Sunday night during the Douglas County Republicans' "We The People" Lincoln-Reagan Dinner Celebration at the Carson Valley Inn.
Abizaid, a Douglas County resident who served as U.S. Central Command commander from 2003-07, spoke on several topics during his "President Trump's Global Strategic Challenges" presentation in the Valley Ballroom.
"I'm here to talk about our great country and about our armed forces. I'm not a political person. I am a soldier of the republic and I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States," Abizaid said. "President Trump has got his hands full … with a lot of things. But I'm here to talk about those things that we as citizens ought to be worried about. Not so much worried about, but we ought to be thinking about; things that are important to us from a national security point of view."
He also expressed his belief that Americans can be confident they are in good hands.  
"I want to point out that our members of the armed forces, our elected officials, our many people that are in the diplomatic services, the CIA or whatever, we can all sleep well at night," Abizaid said. "We can pretend that the situation is going to get worse, but it can't get too bad as long as we have good people with us. I can assure you, we really have good people with us, and we have had ever since the formation of this great republic."
He also outlined some of the challenges facing Trump.
"You can hardly imagine a person who's got more responsibilities than that particular person," Abizaid said. "But he's also got a lot of assets and we need to think about those problems that are going to confront him as our chief executive." 
He listed six points:
■ China 
"China's a very important nation, much bigger than we are. It's got a gross national product that will probably surpass us in a few years, they are building their military might and they're flexing their muscles in the South China Sea," Abizaid said. "And while I'm not predicting we will go to war with them, I am saying that we need to pay attention to what they're doing and keep our armed forces strong so that we don't have to confront them in the distant future. They're a nuclear power. They're very capable. They are worried about all sorts of different things, but in particular, they want to be a competitor to us and we should suspect in the years ahead that we're going to have competition from them; not war, but competition. We need to pay attention to who they are and what they do. And in particular, we need to pay attention to their naval buildup in the South China Sea."
■ North Korea
"Just the other day, the North Koreans launched a nuclear ballistic missile," Abizaid said. "It's not really nuclear yet. It's capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, perhaps. We're not quite sure. But if they ever can get their technology to the point where they can put a nuclear weapon on that intercontinental ballistic missile, then we all need to be nervous. And we need to be nervous because if you haven't paid attention to who's leading that country, you should." He then drew a laugh from the audience in talking about North Korea's Kim Jong-un: "Very unpredictable, has a bad haircut, but dangerous … not only to us, but to his own people. I would say that in the days ahead, probably sooner than later, the president and his senior advisers and his military advisers will have to come up with courses of action to deal with that particular problem, and do so knowing that the Chinese may or may not want us to do whatever course of action we come up with."
■ Russia
Russia is an area of focus for Abizaid in his current position as senior adviser to the Ukrainian Minister of Defense. "The Ukraine is fighting very hard against the Russian separatists. And it's not just Russian separatists that they're fighting. The Russians are using their main force artillery units, cyber capability, electronic warfare and they're being incredibly aggressive there. We have been in support of the Ukrainians giving them non-lethal aid in a way that allows us to bring our soldiers into western Ukraine and train some of their battalions before they go into the combat area. It's hard to say where we're going to head in this relationship with Russia. On one hand, it makes sense to reach out to the Russians and find a better path ahead. But, on the other hand, it also makes sense to protect our NATO allies and protect our friends in the region, such as the Ukrainians, to the extent that we can."
■ The Middle East
The Middle East is his "favorite part of the world." Abizaid's grandparents immigrated from Lebanon in the late 19th century and was himself a Homestead Scholar at the University of Jordan. "In December, I was visiting with some of my colleagues in Kurdistan, which is the northern part of Iraq. We were in the front line area with Kurdish units and watching Iraqi tank units go through on their way to Mosul, and unfortunately, they were going in to liberate the most Sunni of all the cities of Iraq. They were flying Shia battle flags and they had Iranian advisers on their tanks. It was really a wake-up call for me. We've been fighting over there many years and it's far from over." He addressed another major concern. "ISIS is a large Muslim extremist movement that is ideological in nature and seen every Muslim country. We need to be able to defeat them on the battlefield in a couple of different places like Raqqa and Mosul. But we need to understand, beating ISIS causes the rest of the Arab world, and the Sunni Arab world in particular, to ask the question, 'Now what for the rest of us?' And while we need to destroy the extremists with our military forces, diplomatically we must continue to reach out to our Sunni allies and friends in the region in a way that will allow them to have a better chance for a better future. If we don't do that, this ideological trend will never be destroyed."
■ The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
The organization is a subject President Trump brought up during the 2016 election campaign. "Our European friends, as our president says, are not meeting their obligations with regard to how much they're paying for their common defense of NATO. But we need to reach out to them. They're still our allies and friends. We need to reach out to them and encourage them to meet their obligations and make sure that they understand we are with them in this alliance that has been indispensable to us for so long and will continue to be indispensable to us," he said.
■ Nuclear weapon concerns
"We've got to work a way to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons," he said. "We've got work a way to defeat state-sponsored cyber terrorism, which is, unfortunately, coming from everywhere, in particular, Russia and China. Probably the gravest threat to our national defense is sequestration and the continued squandering of resources of national defense by not giving our military enough resources to do their job. I'll be the first to say that our military needs to do some reform itself. We spend too much on high-ticket weapons programs. We're not as efficient as we should be with the taxpayers' dollars. But on the other hand, we can't have an army that's too small for its mission, which we have today. We can't have a navy with not enough ships. It will take years to bring our armed forces back to the strength that they need to be in order to keep the country safe. And to me, that's the number one challenge the president faces."
Abizaid began and ended his presentation by talking about the troops who serve in the U.S. military.
"I've probably said enough about all the potential hot spots and troubles … and I'm still smiling," Abizaid said. "I'm smiling because I know the young people that defend our country. They wear the uniform, they swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, they never let one another down, they're prepared to do whatever the president tells them to do, they are ready to fight for their country wherever that may be. They're serving all over the world in places you can hardly imagine, and they never let us down."

                           This report is the second by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point to assess the demographics, procedures, finances,
                              and leadership of al-Qa'ida's foreign fighters, especially those currently fighting in Iraq. This report analyzes al-Qa'ida
                              in Iraq's (AQI) operations from spring 2006 to summer 2007 and is being issued with a trove of AQI documents captured by coalition
                              forces near Sinjar, Iraq. The documents include almost 600 AQI personnel records for foreign fighters crossing into Iraq,
                              AQI contracts for suicide bombers, AQI contracts for fighters leaving Iraq, narratives written by al-Qa'ida's Syrian smugglers,
                              and AQI financial records. The CTC also acquired demographic information on all Third Country Nationals (TCNs) in detention
                              at Camp Bucca, Iraq. Most of this data has not previously been released to the public

                           worldwide
                           The consensus conclusion of the report is that there is a growing gap between the strategic objectives the U.S. military is
                              expected to achieve and the resources required to do so. The effectiveness of America's other tools for global influence,
                              such as diplomacy and economic engagement, are critically intertwined with and dependent upon the perceived strength, presence
                              and commitment of U.S. armed forces. Yet the capabilities and capacities rightly called for in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense
                              Review clearly exceed the budget resources made available to the Department. This gap is disturbing if not dangerous in light
                              of the fact that global threats and challenges are rising, including a troubling pattern of territorial assertiveness and
                              regional intimidation on China's part, the recent aggression of Russia in Ukraine, nuclear proliferation on the part of North
                              Korea and Iran, a serious insurgency in Iraq that both reflects and fuels the broader sectarian conflicts in the region, the
                              civil war in Syria, and civil strife in the larger Middle East and throughout Africa

                           Few recent national security developments have been as controversial as the increased U.S. reliance on unmanned aerial vehicles
                              (UAVs), more colloquially known as 'drones.' While UAVs have multiple peaceful and commercial applications, heated debates
                              about the use of lethal UAV strikes away from traditional, territorially bounded battlefields have tended to crowd out a broader
                              and more nuanced discussion of US UAV policy. This report represents a preliminary effort to offer analysis and recommendations
                              that could help shape and guide U.S. UAV policy going forward. It looks at the military and national security benefits of
                              UAV technologies, analyzes our current approaches to UAV development and export, and seeks to contextualize the strategic
                              questions relating to the use of lethal UAVs outside traditional battlefields. Ultimately, it offers eight detailed recommendations
                              for overhauling UAV strategy; improving oversight, accountability and transparency; developing forward-looking international
                              norms relating to the use of lethal force in nontraditional settings; and devising sound UAV export control and research and
                              development policies

                           The United States Army is faced today with the prospect of peacekeeping operations around the world. As of this writing the
                              Army has deployed troops to Somalia and is preparing for the possibility of sending still more to the former Yugoslavia. Peacekeeping,
                              once thought to be the province of smaller nations, now is a major concern for the Army. This paper examines the unique peacekeeping
                              environment and identifies the special training requirements for military forces. While the authors do not advocate the full-time
                              training of specialized "peacekeeping units" they recognize the need to change the "mindset" of deploying soldiers from combat
                              to peacekeeping and adequately preparing staffs for such duty. The authors recommend a common sense approach to soldier, unit
                              and staff training designed to better prepare American soldiers for the new challenges ahead

Lt. Gen. John P. Abizaid will be departing as Commander of U.S. Central Command, "part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration’s new Iraq strategy," Bush administration officials said January 4, 2007. Abizaid's departure was expected. It is anticipated he will be replaced by Admiral William J. Fallon, "who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said." [1]
"The changes are being made as the White House is considering an option to increase American combat power in Baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of Anbar in western Iraq," the Bush administration said. [2]
However, both Abizaid and Gen. George W. Casey, Jr., who is also being replaced, "have voiced scepticism about an increase in troop numbers, instead wanting to focus on training Iraqi forces." [3]

"John Abizaid is a different kind of general. He is often cited as the highest-ranking Arab-American in U.S. history. But he is also the leading edge of a new generation. While both Tommy R. Franks and Jay Garner were blooded as young officers in Vietnam, Abizaid, 51, graduated from West Point in 1973, just as the U.S. withdrew from that war. He learned his trade, instead, in brushfires around the world: in Lebanon, Grenada, and Bosnia, and in northern Iraq in 1991, where he worked for Garner. A TV-savvy briefer whose Grenada exploits using a hotwired bulldozer under fire were fictionalized in a 1986 Clint Eastwood movie called Heartbreak Ridge, Abizaid has been the subject of countless flattering newspaper profiles -- the kind of attention that can derail a career in the fervently self-effacing Army. But if he has enemies, they're keeping quiet. Said retired Army Col. Robert Killebrew, 'he is one of the very few emerging Army personalities about whom one only hears good things.'
"Yet Abizaid has hardly shunned risks. As a young officer, he left the elite Rangers to take a military scholarship at the University of Jordan. During his officially academic tour in Amman, Abizaid strayed off campus to train with Jordanian commandos and travel in the Middle East, including then-obscure Iraq, where Saddam Hussein was rising to power. Said Killebrew, 'Abizaid bucked the usual assignment ladder and became an Arabic specialist at a time when that wasn't always a good career move, purely because he intellectually believed the Army would need Arabic specialists. Well, he was right.'
"Abizaid's investment paid off in 1985, when he joined the United Nations monitoring mission in his ancestral Lebanon. 'He had a tremendous reputation,' recalled another Lebanon peacekeeper, retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson, and 'got along well with Palestinians, Lebanese, and Israelis.' Abizaid brought the same diplomacy to northern Iraq in 1991, when he peacefully eased Iraqi regulars out of Kurdish areas, once by bombarding them with loud rock music. He returned to the region this January when he was named one of two deputies to Franks, who -- managing 24 other countries in his theater of operations -- is likely to delegate day-to-day work on postwar Iraq to Abizaid.
"Mideast specialist though he is, Abizaid is also at home in the Pentagon. His last assignment before Central Command was as director of the Joint Staff, an obscure but powerful back-office position charged with coordinating the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines. In a letter leaked last fall, Abizaid blasted bureaucrats for evading 'the fundamental issue that the Department of Defense is not effectively structured to effect the organizing, training, and equipping of joint forces' -- impolitic words for the Pentagon, but music to the ears of Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who has also been known to rail against service rivalries."

John Philip Abizaid (born April 1, 1951) is a retired United States Army general and former U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) commander, overseeing American military operations in a 27-country region, from the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, to South and Central Asia, covering much of the Middle East. CENTCOM oversees 250,000 US troops. Abizaid succeeded General Tommy Franks as Commander, USCENTCOM, on July 7, 2003, and was also elevated to the rank of four-star general the same week. He was succeeded by Admiral William J. Fallon on March 16, 2007.
Abizaid retired from the military on May 1, 2007 after 34 years of service.[1] As of 2007, Abizaid is employed as a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[2] He assumed the Distinguished Chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point in December 2007.

Early life and education[edit]
A Lebanese American, Abizaid was born in northern California in 1951. His grandparents had immigrated to California from southern Lebanon during the late 19th century.[5] He was raised Roman Catholic.[5] His father, a Navy machinist in World War II, raised him after Abizaid's mother died of cancer.[5]
Abizaid's military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid's 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master's student he has kept, saying, "It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.[6]
Career[edit]

Abizaid was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge.
Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.
His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the “Big Red One,” in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.
Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks.
On December 20, 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld.[7] On March 16, 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as Commander, U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.
On September 8, 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Abizaid is married[5] and has three children.[5] He learned Arabic in the military.[5]
Global War on Terrorism speech[edit]
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.[9]
2006–2007 comments on Iraq[edit]
On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]

John Philip Abizaid (born April 1, 1951) is a retired United States Army general and former U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) commander, overseeing American military operations in a 27-country region, from the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, to South and Central Asia, covering much of the Middle East. CENTCOM oversees 250,000 US troops. Abizaid succeeded General Tommy Franks as Commander, USCENTCOM, on July 7, 2003, and was also elevated to the rank of four-star general the same week. He was succeeded by Admiral William J. Fallon on March 16, 2007.
Abizaid retired from the military on May 1, 2007 after 34 years of service.[1] As of 2007, Abizaid is employed as a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[2] He assumed the Distinguished Chair of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point in December 2007. Abizaid was appointed to the board of directors of RPM International on January 24, 2008, and also sits on the board of directors of the Defense Ventures Group.[3] In 2008 he was selected as a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.[4]

Early life and education[edit]
A Lebanese American, Abizaid was born in northern California in 1951. His grandparents had immigrated to California from southern Lebanon during the late 19th century.[5] He was raised Roman Catholic.[5] His father, a Navy machinist in World War II, raised him after Abizaid's mother died of cancer.[5]
Abizaid's military education includes the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York (Class of 1973); Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, Armed Forces Staff College, and a U.S. Army War College Senior Fellowship at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
In his civilian studies, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and was an Olmsted Scholar at the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. Abizaid greatly impressed his teachers at Harvard University. Nadav Safran, the director of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies kept Abizaid's 100-page paper on defense policy for Saudi Arabia, the only paper of a master's student he has kept, saying, "It was absolutely the best seminar paper I ever got in my 30-plus years at Harvard.[6]
Career[edit]

Abizaid was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Class of June 1973. He started his career with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he served as a rifle and scout platoon leader. He commanded companies in the 2nd and 1st Ranger Battalions, leading a Ranger Rifle Company during the invasion of Grenada. In 1983, he jumped from an MC-130 onto a landing strip in Grenada and ordered one of his Rangers to drive a bulldozer like a tank toward Cuban troops as he advanced behind it—a move highlighted in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge.
Abizaid commanded the 3rd Battalion, 325th Airborne Regiment combat Team in Vicenza, Italy, during the Persian Gulf War and deployed with the battalion in Northern Iraq to provide a safe haven for the Kurds.
His brigade command was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Armored Division, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following that tour, he served as the 66th Commandant at the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, he reined in hazing rituals and revamped the curriculum. Later, he took command of the 1st Infantry Division, the “Big Red One,” in Würzburg, Germany, from David L. Grange, which provided the first U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. He served as the Deputy Commander (Forward), Combined Forces Command, U.S. Central Command during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Staff assignments include a tour with the United Nations as Operations Officer (G-3) for Observer Group Lebanon and a tour in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. European staff tours include assignments in both the Southern European Task Force and Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe. Abizaid also served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) on the Joint Staff and Director of the Joint Staff.
Following the Iraq War and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he assumed command of Central Command from General Tommy Franks.
On December 20, 2006, it was announced that Abizaid would step down from his position and retire in March 2007. He had planned to retire earlier, but stayed at the urging of Donald Rumsfeld.[7] On March 16, 2007, Abizaid transferred command to Admiral William J. Fallon, after serving longer as Commander, U.S. Central Command than any of his predecessors.
On September 8, 2016, Abizaid was appointed advisor to Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.[8]
Personal life[edit]
Abizaid is married[5] and has three children.[5] He learned Arabic in the military.[5]
Global War on Terrorism speech[edit]
In November 2005, Abizaid gave a speech on the Global War on Terrorism at the Naval War College.[9]
2006–2007 comments on Iraq[edit]
On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]



















 





























































































  



International decorations[edit]

 Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia[16]
 Gold Cross of Honour of the Bundeswehr (Ehrenkreuz der Bundeswehr in Gold)

On August 3, 2006, Abizaid, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following about the situation on the ground in Iraq: "I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war." He also testified, "I'm optimistic that that slide [toward civil war] can be prevented".[10]
Bob Woodward on Abizaid and Murtha[edit]
In State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III (as excerpted in Newsweek magazine), Bob Woodward of the Washington Post wrote that on March 16, 2006 Abizaid was in Washington to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "He painted a careful but upbeat picture of the situation in Iraq." Subsequently, "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable." Abizaid said he wanted to speak frankly, and "according to Murtha, Abizaid raised his hand for emphasis and held his thumb and forefinger a quarter of an inch from each other and said, "We're that far apart."
On October 1, 2006, an interview of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast on the television show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and said yes.[11]
Iran's nuclear program[edit]
In remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported on September 17, 2007, Abizaid stated, "We need to press the international community as hard as we possibly can, and the Iranians, to cease and desist on the development of a nuclear weapon and we should not preclude any option that we may have to deal with it." He also said, "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear."
"There are ways to live with a nuclear Iran," Abizaid said, "Let's face it, we lived with a nuclear Soviet Union, we've lived with a nuclear China, and we're living with (other) nuclear powers as well."[12]
Awards and decorations[edit]
Abizaid has been decorated for service, to include:[13][14][15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

John Abizaid Quotes

American

Soldier

Born: April 1, 1951










































   Loading...






Every American soldier wants as much public support as he can possibly have. That's the soldiers on duty in Iraq, and that's me, as well. We fight better knowing that our people back home support us, back us, and understand what we're doing. It's hugely important.
John Abizaid


Home,
Patriotism,
Support



















But the truth of the matter is that there is there is an opportunity for them to participate in the economic and political future of the country and certainly in the security life of the country.
