A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 



	Note 1 Background



	 


	B Green Innovations, Inc., a Matawan, New
	Jersey-based corporation, (OTC Pink® marketplace: BGNN), formerly iVoice Technology, Inc., (“B Green Innovations”

	iVoice, Inc. (“iVoice”). In May 2008, the Company formed B Green Innovations, Inc. (“B Green”), a wholly-owned
	subsidiary to commercialize its “green” technology platforms.


	 


	On November 17, 2009, pursuant to an Agreement

	Inc., merged into iVoice Technology, Inc.


	 


	On July 28, 2009, the Board of Directors

	the Certificate of Incorporation with the State of New Jersey to officially change the name of the Company.


	 


	On October 8, 2016, the Registrant’s
	Board of Directors, acting pursuant to its Amended Articles of Incorporation, unanimously approved to change the name of the Registrant
	from B Green Innovations, Inc. to 024 Pharma, Inc. by amending Article One of the Registrant’s Articles of Incorporation.
	The purpose of the name change is to more fully encapsulate the Registrant’s current operations and business direction. The
	New Jersey Secretary of State, effective October 12, 2016, processed the name change and the Registrant has filed for a symbol
	change with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). The Company will also obtain a new CUSIP number

	Management plans to increase the development,

	Note 4 Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies



	 


	a)    Basis
	of Presentation


	 


	The accompanying condensed unaudited interim
	financial statements included herein have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The condensed financial statements and notes are presented as permitted on Form 10-Q
	and do not contain information included in the Company's annual statements and notes. Certain information and footnote disclosures
	normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures
	are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read
	in conjunction with the December 31, 2015 financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. While management believes the
	procedures followed in preparing these condensed financial statements are reasonable, the accuracy of the amounts are in some respects
	dependent upon the facts that will exist, and procedures that will be accomplished by the Company later in the year. These results
	are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.


	 


	These condensed unaudited financial statements
	reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present
	fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods presented.


	 


	b)    Use
	of Estimates


	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.


	 


	c)    Revenue
	Recognition


	 


	In addition to cash flow generated
	from sale of natural supplements such as:


	 




	 



	·




	Diabetes





	 



	·




	Lung cleanse





	 



	·




	Seal oil





	 



	·




	Prostate





	 



	·




	Stress less





	 


	Company intends to produce the “health
	phone” that will significantly increase demand in their product and enlarge the product purchase. Clients will be able to
	purchase products through this smartphone and it contains application that measure heartbeat, calories, fat, excises schedule etc.
	The most important thing is that clients will have this option to talk to health specialists.


	 


	d)    Product Warranties


	 


	The Company estimates its warranty costs
	based on historical warranty claims experience in estimating potential warranty claims. Management has determined that warranty
	costs are immaterial and has not included an accrual for potential warranty claims. Presently, costs related to warranty coverage
	are expensed as incurred. Warranty claims are reviewed quarterly to verify that warranty liabilities properly reflect any remaining
	obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.


	 


	 


	 


	 








	 



	7



	 






	 



	 


	e)    Research
	and Development Costs


	 


	Research and development costs are
	charged to expense when incurred. The Company has not incurred any research and development costs for the year ended
	December 31, 2016.


	 


	f)    Advertising
	Costs


	 


	Advertising costs are expensed as
	incurred and are included in selling expenses. The Company has incurred advertising costs for the year ended December
	31, 2016 and it counts $42,431 USD.


	 


	g)    Cash
	and Cash Equivalents


	 


	The Company considers all highly
	liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash
	equivalents at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company maintains cash balances at financial
	institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to federally insured
	limits. At times balances may exceed FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.


	 


	h)   Concentration
	of Credit Risk


	 


	Financial instruments that
	potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and cash. As
	of December 31, 2016 the Company believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration within its
	accounts receivable.


	 


	j)    Accounts Receivable


	 


	Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing
	obligations due under normal trade terms. Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any
	receivables will be potentially uncollectible. Historical bad debts and current economic trends are used in evaluating the allowance
	for doubtful accounts. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with
	a general reserve, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
	receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its allowance for doubtful
	accounts as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is adequate.


	 


	j)   Property
	and Equipment


	 


	Property and equipment is stated at cost.
	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five to
	seven years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.


	 


	k)   Intangible Assets


	 


	Registration and maintenance costs associated
	with the filing and registration of patents are prepaid and amortized over the remaining life of the patent, not to exceed 20 years.
	Costs associated with such patents are not approved or abandoned.

	l)   Income Taxes


	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes using
	the asset and liability method described in FASB ASC 740. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant
	being: a) tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years; b) expenses recognized in the
	books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs; and c) valuation changes of assets which need to
	be tax effected for book purposes but are deductible only when the valuation change is realized.


	 


	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted
	tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred
	tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit, which is not more likely than not to be realized.
	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, future taxable income is estimated, considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards.
	Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates
	and future taxable income levels. In the event it was determined, that the Company would not be able to realize all or a portion
	of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination
	is made. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of
	the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which
	that determination is made. In its evaluation of a valuation allowance, the Company takes into account existing contracts and backlog,
	and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products. The Company
	prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient
	taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.


	 


	The Company adopted FASB ASC 740-10-50,
	Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. ASC 740-10-50 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
	financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740-10 requires
	that the Company determine whether the benefits of its tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained upon audit based
	on the technical merits of the tax position. The Company recognizes the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on its
	income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. 


	 


	Despite the Company’s belief that
	its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, one or more positions may be challenged by taxing authorities.
	Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations
	or litigation.


	 


	Interest and penalties related
	to income tax matters, if applicable, will be recognized as income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not incur any expense related to interest or penalties for income tax
	matters, and no such amounts were accrued as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 


	m)     Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments


	 


	The carrying amounts reported in
	the balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for cash and cash equivalents, marketable
	securities, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued
	expenses other current liabilities approximate the fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these
	financial instruments.  The fair value of the debt approximates its carrying value at the stated discount rate of the
	debt to reflect recent market conditions.


	 


	n)     Long-Lived
	Assets


	 


	The Company assesses the recoverability
	of the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
	an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
	of an asset to future, undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
	the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of
	the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. No impairment
	losses were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	 


	There were various other updates recently
	issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and
	are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF  OPERATIONS




	 




	Forward Looking Statements




	 


	A number of the statements made by the
	Company in this report may be regarded as “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
	Litigation Reform Act of 1995.


	 


	Forward-looking statements include, among
	others, statements concerning the Company’s outlook, pricing trends and forces within the industry, the completion dates
	of capital projects, expected sales growth, cost reduction strategies and their results, long-term goals of the Company and other
	statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning
	matters that are not historical facts.


	 


	All predictions as to future results contain
	a measure of uncertainty and accordingly, actual results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause a difference
	are: changes in the general economy; changes in demand for the Company’s products or in the cost and availability of its
	raw materials; the actions of its competitors; the success of our customers; technological change; changes in employee relations;
	government regulations; litigation, including its inherent uncertainty; difficulties in plant operations and materials; transportation,
	environmental matters; and other unforeseen circumstances. For a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that the Company
	faces, see the discussion in the Form 10−K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 entitled “Risk Factors”.


	 






	Results of Operations




	 


	Total sales increased $1,014,833 (1568.33%)
	for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is caused by the company
	business expansion strategy. The Company continues to evaluate additional products to add to its product line as well as expanding
	its distribution channels.


	 


	Gross profit increased $ 905,115 (2652.11%)
	for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is caused by the company
	management and business model change.


	 


	Total selling, general and administrative
	expenses decreased $212,898 (- 42.84%) for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year.
	This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in consulting and legal fees as compared to the prior year when the company
	was closing on the new debt instruments. The company continues to curtail spending to conserve cash during this period of declining
	revenues.


	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2016 and
	2015, the Company had earnings from operations of $621,040.


	 


	Total other expense decreased $ 388,589
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from decreases in amortization
	of debt discount and losses on changes in valuation of derivatives and higher settlement expenses on debt to stock conversions.


	The net earnings for the year ended December
	31, 2016 increased by $1,474,532, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from the implementing of new product
	line, business model.

	 







	Liquidity and Capital Resources

	Company’s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS  Forward Looking Statements  A number of the statements made by the Company in this report may be regarded as "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning the Company's outlook, pricing trends and forces within the industry, the completion dates of capital projects, expected sales growth, cost reduction strategies and their results, long-term goals of the Company and other statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  All predictions as to future results contain a measure of uncertainty and accordingly, actual results could differ materially. Among the factors that could cause a difference are: changes in the general economy; changes in demand for the Company's products or in the cost and availability of its raw materials; the actions of its competitors; the success of our customers; technological change; changes in employee relations; government regulations; litigation, including its inherent uncertainty; difficulties in plant operations and materials; transportation, environmental matters; and other unforeseen circumstances. For a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that the Company faces, see the discussion in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 entitled "Risk Factors".  Results of Operations  Total sales decreased $ 118,545.49 (71.25%) for the three months ended March, 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is caused by the company business expansion strategy. The Company continues to evaluate additional products to add to its product line as well as expanding its distribution channels.  Gross profit decreased $ 43,323.32 (71.25%) for the three months ended March, 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is caused by the company management and business model change.  Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $ 186,420.15 (28.75%) for the three months ended March, 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in consulting and legal fees as compared to the prior year when the company was closing on the new debt instruments. The company continues to curtail spending to conserve cash during this period of declining revenues.  For the three months ended March, 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had earnings from operations of $ 36,507.58.  Total other expense decreased $ 58,885.05 for the three months ended March, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from decreases in amortization of debt discount and losses on changes in valuation of derivatives and higher settlement expenses on debt to stock conversions.  The net earnings for the three months ended March, 31, 2017 increased by $ 23,931.58, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily from the implementing of new product line, business model.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the three months ended March, 31, 2017, the Company had a net increase in cash of $36,507.58.  There was no significant impact on the Company's operations as a result of inflation for the three months ended March, 31, 2017.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventory obsolescence, intangible assets, payroll tax obligations, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We have identified below the accounting policy on revenue recognition, related to what we believe is the most critical to our business operations and is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition or Plan of Operation where such policy affects our reported and expected financial results.  Revenue Recognition  For natural supplements, revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to, or acceptance by customer, provided title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Provisions, when appropriate, are made where the right to return exists.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  During the three months ended March, 31, 2017, the Company did not engage in any material off-balance sheet activities nor have any relationships or arrangements with unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Further, the Company has not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do they have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
