This is a technique to move teeth with a thin plastic “aligner” that is almost invisible. It allows us to provide orthodontics to people who do not want the wires and metal bands on the teeth.Invisalign OrthodonticsA clear alternative to metal braces. Invisalign consists of a series of aligners that you switch out about every two weeks. Each aligner is individually manufactured with exact calculations to gradually shift your teeth into place.ImplantsDental ImplantsWhen implants are needed to replace missing teeth, we work with a team approach. We work with an oral surgeon or periodontist. They will place the implant in the bone and we will work with the lab technician making the crown or porcelain and metal bridge. This will create the best possible results for our patients. Providing implants to restore missing teeth is very difficult. By utilizing the team approach, we are able to achieve excellent success.RestorativeBridgesFillingsVeneersVeneers, which are sometimes called facings, allow us to “reface” upper and lower front teeth that need cosmetic repair because of poor color, shape, position, or many old fillings. If the tooth is strong enough, we only have to place these on the front of the teeth, thereby saving most of the natural tooth structure. They provide a veneer that makes the teeth look great.CrownsA visit to the office of Dr. Stuart Katz is unique in every way. A comfortable and positive experience awaits you from the time you enter our office, until your treatment is complete. State of the art facilities, professional and friendly staff and personal attention are combined to provide you with outstanding dental care. We design a plan that meets your expectations and more, including preventative care, one-appointment crowns, facings and inlays.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentRoot canal treatment is done when a "nerve" dies in a tooth. It really is removing the soft tissue inside of the root of the tooth and then sealing this area. It is usually painless, with the use of a local anesthetic. With new high tech sonic measuring device to measure the inside length and special high-tech files, most root canals can be done in one appointment with better success and fewer problems than when they used to take two to four appointments. This is one of the many areas that dentistry has advanced in recent years.GeneralTeeth WhiteningTooth whitening is a placing a gel on your teeth to whiten them. Our BriteSmile procedure can whiten about 7 shades in about 1 ½ hours.Cosmetic DentistryCosmetic dentistry is an all-encompassing word to describe many treatments that we can do to make your teeth look lighter in color, straighter, normal shape and size, and make the gum tissues healthy and contoured naturally.General DentistryDr. Stuart Katz has been in the practice of general dentistry over 30 years. A native of Cleveland, Dr. Katz received his undergraduate education at Washington and Jefferson College, in Washington, Pennsylvania. His Doctor of Dental Surgery was earned at Case Western Reserve University and his General Practice Residency was done at Mt. Sinai Medical Center of Cleveland. After working for Uncle Sam (Navy), Dr. Katz joined Dr. Dan Butler in private practice in University Heights in 1972. They enjoyed a close and happy partnership for 16 years, until Dr. Butler's retirement.PreventiveTeeth CleaningFluoride TreatmentThe appointments are usually an hour. This gives our dental hygienists enough time to not only clean your teeth, but review your medical history, take your blood pressure, take the necessary x-rays, give a fluoride treatment, discuss oral hygiene techniques.DiagnosticX-raysOral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryMaxillofacial SurgeryIn 1981 he was awarded a Fellowship in the Academy of General Dentistry and continues his education through monthly meetings that provide information on the most current standards of care in dentistry and medicine. Dr. Katz was an active visiting dentist and instructor in the department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and General Dentistry at the former Mt. Sinai Medical Center, where he served as Head of the General Practice Residency Program for many years. He has been a volunteer in numerous community organizations, and has donated his time to Christina's Smile, an organization that provides free dentistry to inner city children via a mobile dental unit. Dr. Katz was an avid sailor, but has given it up to work in his backyard pond, where he talks to the frogs. In the 30+ years Dr. Katz has lost his hair, but not his sense of humor or his dedication to provide the best dental care possible for his patients.PeriodonticsDeep CleaningSend to PhoneStuart B Katz Inc24100 Chagrin Blvd Ste 170, Beachwood, OH 44122(216) 464-6300Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailStuart B Katz Inc24100 Chagrin Blvd Ste 170, Beachwood, OH 44122(216) 464-6300Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

			Stuart B. Katz, age 62, previously served on the Board from 2002 to 2008 and was reappointed to serve on the Board in April 2011. Mr. Katz serves on our Audit Committee, is Chairman of our Compensation Committee and also serves as Presiding Director. Since 2007, Mr. Katz has served as Chief Executive Officer and member of the board of directors of Alconox, Inc., a private company engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of specialty chemicals. From 2001 to 2010, Mr. Katz was a Managing Director of Jefferies Capital Partners ("JCP"), a private equity investment fund. In 2002, Mr. Katz joined the Board in connection with JCP's investment in the Company. In May 2008, Mr. Katz declined to stand for reelection to the Board in connection with JCP's divestment of its remaining equity interest in the Company. Prior to joining JCP in 2001, Mr. Katz had been an investment banker with Furman Selz LLC and its successors for over 16 years. Mr. Katz received a B.S. in engineering from Cornell University and a J.D. from Fordham Law School. Mr. Katz is a member of the bar of the State of New York. Mr. Katz brings valuable leadership and management skills as a result of his role as Chief Executive Officer of Alconox, as well as a result of his service as a member of the board of directors of a number of other companies, including other public companies. We believe that this experience, as well as the investment management experience he has gained through the ownership of controlling equity positions in connection with his activities with JCP, make him a valuable part of our Board and member of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee.
