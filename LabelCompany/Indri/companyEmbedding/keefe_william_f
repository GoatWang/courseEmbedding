Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. William T Doty & Assoc85 Main StRidgefield, CT 06877(203) 438-2840OptometristsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. William Kenny Assoc195 Tunxis Hill RdFairfield, CT 06825(203) 366-0588Environmental & Ecological ConsultantsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. William Paul & Assocs27 Holland AveWhite Plains, NY 10603(914) 761-0010Printers-Equipment & SuppliesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. William Hyman & Assoc565 Taxter Rd Ste 625Elmsford, NY 10523(914) 332-0555Agriculture InsuranceInsuranceAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection5. William Paul & Assoc16 Yellowstone AveWhite Plains, NY 10607(914) 761-0506Printers-Equipment & SuppliesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection6. William J Loftus Assoc53 Glen Byron AveNyack, NY 10960(845) 353-0324Executive Search ConsultantsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Bill Thompson Assoc131 Walworth AveWhite Plains, NY 10606(914) 285-9525InsuranceAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection8. William Silberstein Assoc1600 Harrison Ave Ste 202Mamaroneck, NY 10543(914) 698-2744Management ConsultantsBusinesses in related categories to AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED9. Schweitzer Marvin P Dr.1 Westport AveNorwalk, CT 06851(203) 847-2788Stress Management & PreventionWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED10. Dermatologic Laser Center Of CT153 East AveNorwalk, CT 06851(203) 853-1191LasersPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoMake an AppointmentVisit our websitecyruschessmd.comFrom Business: Call today to schedule a consultative appointment to discuss your laser skin care needs.Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Brewster Footcare Group314 Clock Tower CmnsBrewster, NY 10509(877) 495-8225Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Offering podiatry and orthotics services.

CEO Clubs Member William F. O'Keeffe











Name: William F. O'KeeffeTitle/Position: President 
/ CEOCompany: O'keeffe's Inc., Safti FirstBusiness 
Description: Chapter: Super PAC 
Please inquire with The CEO Clubs for member contact information. Website: http://safti.com
 
Bio:
Bill was born, raised, educated and resides in San Francisco, CA.  He 
has served as past President of Northern California Construction Institute (NCCI), 
past Commander of the San Francisco Sheriff's Air Squadron, past or active member 
of AAMA, NFPA, BOCA, SBCCI, NGA, CSI, ANSI, ASTM and GANA.  He is a member 
and financial supporter of: St. Brendan's Church, the Arc Angels, the Edgewood 
center, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco opera and the Wheel Chair 
Foundation. Fund raiser and on the committee of the San Francisco Bay Area Boy 
Scouts, the Leukemia& Lymphoma society, and the Little Jim club. Member 
and honored by the Landsmen and the Irish Israeli Italian society. He is also 
a Supporter and current board of director of the San Francisco Playhouse.
Bill is committed to the glass industry's effort to improve the lives and 
safety of the public through the use of safety fire-rated glazing. During the 
company's testing of fire-rated products and the use of these products in the 
early 1980s, they discovered how unsafe wired-glass was in regard to impact 
standards and uncovered a history of serious injuries to the public, especially 
its use in K-12 applications.  This discovery commenced a 20-year battle 
against the exemption given to wired-glass from meeting impact safety standards. 
 Due to Bill raising awareness amongst the industry leaders and code officials, 
he became known as "the Wired Warrior".  Finally in May 2004, 
the battle climaxed with the exemption being removed and wired-glass no longer 
may be used in K-12 schools in areas where impact is of a concerned.  He 
developed the first 'safe' wired-glass product to answer the need for an inexpensive 
safe solution for schools and other public applications.
Bill is considered the 'Father' of fire-rated glazing in the USA by being 
the first to introduce in 1982 a wireless fire-rated glazing rated from 20-180 
minutes with hose stream, first to develop a safe wired-glass to meet the highest 
safety standards of Cat. II requirements, first to manufacture in the U.S. low 
cost tempered products that meet fire endurance test from 20-60 minutes.  Other 
first accomplishments include the first to introduce fire ballistic and forced 
entry glass as a single component, first to combine ballistic and fire-rated 
framing, first with aluminum fire-rated framing, and first with wood clad fire-rated 
framing.  He also employed & trained other leaders in the fire glass 
industry including Scott Foote, past President of InterEdge, Kurt Ratzel, current 
Director of International Fire-Rated Glazing for Vetrotech and Bill Koffel as 
his code consultant in the 1980s until he was hired away by the wired-glass 
industry to represent them as he still does today.  
Bill is active in the day to day management of SAFTI FIRST / O'Keeffe's. 
He enjoys travel, boating, flying, fishing, and good food with great company.

 Modern society, and in particular modern American society, survives, grows, and prospers on the mantra of progress. "Find a better way and don't look back"-that's the rubric that provides the driving power behind America's passion for advancement, invention, novelty.  Well and good, say the thoughtfully inclined. But what of ethics, the branch of philosophy that asks us to judge whether human actions are right or wrong? Is anyone on the right side if ethics is not considered-in, say, performing an abortion? In the cloning of humans? In male "motherhood?"  Such issues, plus others like artificial insemination and the embryonation of women, come to the point of open, violent conflict in William F. Keefe's novel The Male Element. Ethicist James Vandorn takes it upon himself to rid his peaceful community of what he considers crimes against nature. Those so-called crimes center on embryologist, Dr. Emlyn Brand's experiments with simians and then with volunteer human subjects. Brand's target: a "pregnant man."   Can the outcome be settled peaceably once each man decides that his cause is the valid one? Blood flows. A fetus is aborted by the violence that also leads to a protagonist's death.
