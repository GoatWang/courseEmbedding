We welcome inquiries directly from principals as well as intermediaries. Prior to meeting with prospective portfolio companies, we would like to receive and review an executive summary. This summary should include a description of the company and its industry, historical and projected summary financial statements, management biographies and a transaction overview. We will try to respond to your request within one week.
Finally, if your request does not meet our investment criteria, we will make a concerted effort to refer you to other sources of capital known to us that may be a fit.
