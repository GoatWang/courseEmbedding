Product Lines
     
The AutoXpress® Platform  is an automated, functionally closed system that consistently and efficiently concentrates the stem cell-rich buffy coat of blood, and isolates it from the plasma and red blood cell fractions.
The system reduces bulk and concentrates the buffy coat to  a precise volume selected by the operator and does so with the highest precision, safety, and confidence.

Functionally closed system for sterile processing
Rapid, scale-able processing in standard centrifuge
Automates the volume reduction process
Provides consistent cell concentration volumes
Ensures high recoveries of mononuclear cells (MNCs) in a targeted volume
Allows for simultaneously processesing of multiple samples in one centrifuge
Software that enables GMP compliance

AXP®   for Cord Blood Processing
MXP™ MarrowXpress for Bone Marrow Processing
Cryopreservation-BioArchive

The BioArchive® System is the only fully robotic storage and retrieval system for cryopreserving stem cell samples.
By using a proven, computer controlled technology and tracking software, the BioArchive provides the best protection for today’s valuable stem cell samples that meet tomorrow’s stem cell therapy needs.
