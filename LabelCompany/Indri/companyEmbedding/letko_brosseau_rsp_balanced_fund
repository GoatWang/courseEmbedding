Each year API Asset Performance Inc., an investment counseling and research consultancy firm, unveils the list of the best performing managers ranked by various asset classes.
This week the pension consultant released the 2013 winners, which are the managers, or the firms that generated the best one-year performance numbers. The winners are drawn from the firms/pooled funds that are part of its database. Here are the results:
 BALANCED FUNDS The top performer was the Hughes Little Balanced Fund, which posted an annual return of 26.94%. That gain for the Vancouver-based manager was just ahead of the 26.5% gain recorded by the Letko Brosseau RSP Balanced Fund, but comfortably ahead of third placed, Trimark Income Growth Fund which recorded a 22.94% advance.
 CANADIAN EQUITIES North Growth Canadian Equity Fund, managed by Rory North – whose father Rudy was one of the founders of Vancouver-based PH&N — posted the best one-year gain: the fund was up by 46.97%. (The same fund, that has 40% exposure to technology companies, is up 15% this year.) That return was considerably higher than the 33.59% increase generated by CI Cambridge and the 30.96% gain for 1832 Canadian Value.
US EQUITY The 1832 U.S. Growth Fund generated the largest one-year gain: It was up by 51.59%, just ahead of the 51.37% rise for the Louisbourg US Equity Fund and the 50.45% increase posted by Kingwest U.S. Equity Portfolio.
INTERNATIONAL EQUITYThe Q International Fund, managed by Connor Clark & Lunn, posted the largest increase, a 39.05% gain, slightly ahead of the 38.79% increase generated by the Bissett International Equity Fund and the 38.34% jump posted by the Brandes Canada International Equity Trust.
GLOBAL EQUITY It was no contest given that the Orbis Global Equity Strategy was up by 56.17% — about 10 percentage points above the 47.25% gained by the Templeton Global Equity Trust. CC&L’s Q Group Global Fund was up by 44.94% for the year.
 SMALL CAP Over the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, the Mawer New Canada Fund posted a gain of 51.08% — a touch ahead of the 49.36% increase made by the HSBC Canadian Small Cap Equity Pooled Fund, but comfortably ahead of third placed, the QV Small Cap Fund.
UNIVERSE BONDS It was tough to generate any return at all from this asset class: With a gain of 0.35% the 1832 Canadian Bond Fund was the best performer. The second and third placed firms – the Aurion Income Opportunities Fund and the Jarislowsky Fraser Bond Fund – posted gains of 0.24% and 0.09% respectively.

Together, we'll finish something.
5 STEPS TO THE FINISH



1
