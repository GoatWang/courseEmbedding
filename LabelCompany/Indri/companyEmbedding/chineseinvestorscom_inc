Overview:
ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX), founded in 1999, endeavors to be a leading financial information website that provides real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services to Chinese-speaking investors via the company’s dynamic financial website, www.chinesefn.com. The Company went public on OTCQB in January 2012 under the symbol CIIX.
After recognizing unprecedented opportunities in the U.S. cannabis industry, ChineseInvestors.com started laying the groundwork to capitalize on the growing demand for Cannabidiol-based (CBD) nutrition and health products. By the end of 2016, the Company has begun implementing its plans for a new website, mobile application and online distribution of CBD oils for the booming global Medical Marijuana industry. While marijuana use in China is illegal, cannabis-based oils including Hemp based CBD’s are legal, thus opening a potential market of nearly two billion people for the Company.
In order to help patients with epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, cirrhosis of the liver, etc., ChineseInvestors.com will continue to focus on investment in both the distribution and the R&D of CBD medicine and health products. Based on the company’s huge user base of more than 100,000 people and the brand value built over an 18-year period going back to 1999, our mission is to become the leading Chinese Medicine Marijuana public trading company.




Services:


Real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified)


Support services to our various partners


Consultative services to smaller private companies considering becoming a public company


Advertising and public relations related support services


Other services we may identify having the potential to create value or partnership opportunity with our existing services

(CIIX) ("CIIX" or the "Company"), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that Chinesehempoil.com Inc., established last month as a wholly owned subsidiary of CIIX, will officially launch its own premium hemp health product line 'OptHemp,' which will include the Company's first private label product, OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil.The OptHemp products will be available at http://www.ChineseHempOil.com, the Company's official bi-lingual site. CIIX will use multiple sales channels to implement its sales plan including online sales, retail sales and direct marketing. As part of its plan, CIIX is close to completing construction on its first retail store, which will be among the first retail stores to offer premium hemp-based products along with other health products in San Gabriel, CA. The Company is expected to open the retail store this June in an optimal location within one of the city's premier Chinese consumer districts.   "I am very pleased to announce the launch of our first premium OptHemp product," says Warren Wang, founder and CEO of CIIX. "Hemp oil is believed to have positive balancing effects on the mind and body of persons using them."OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil, the line's base level product, is extracted and purified with raw materials from 100% organic farms in Colorado using a supercritical CO2 extraction technology. OptHemp products are GMO-free, making them attractive to consumers concerned about product source and purity."We believe that the desire for better quality of life in the Chinese community, coupled with fact that the aging population continues to grow, will lead to continued growth in the alternative health sector and increased demand for natural hemp-based health products," says Wang. CIIX is confident that its OptHemp product line will lay a solid foundation for the Company's entrance into the legal hemp industry and the alternative health sector."About ChineseInvestors.com (CIIX)  Founded in 1999, ChineseInvestors.com endeavors to be an innovative company providing: (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified); (b) advertising and public relation related support services; and (c) retail and online sales of hemp-based products and other health related products.For more information visit ChineseInvestors.comSubscribe and watch our video commentaries: https://www.youtube.com/user/ChinesefncomFollow us on Twitter for real-time Company updates: https://twitter.com/ChineseFNEnglshLike us on Facebook to receive live feeds: https://www.facebook.com/ChinesefncomAdd us on WeChat: Chinesefn or download iPhone iOS App: Chinesefn.Forward-Looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

SAN GABRIEL, California, May 24, 2017

SAN GABRIEL, California, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) ("CIIX" or the "Company"), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that Chinesehempoil.com Inc., established last month as a wholly owned subsidiary of CIIX, will officially launch its own premium hemp health product line 'OptHemp,' which will include the Company's first private label product, OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil.
The OptHemp products will be available at http://www.ChineseHempOil.com, the Company's official bi-lingual site. CIIX will use multiple sales channels to implement its sales plan including online sales, retail sales and direct marketing. As part of its plan, CIIX is close to completing construction on its first retail store, which will be among the first retail stores to offer premium hemp-based products along with other health products in San Gabriel, CA. The Company is expected to open the retail store this June in an optimal location within one of the city's premier Chinese consumer districts.  
 "I am very pleased to announce the launch of our first premium OptHemp product," says Warren Wang, founder and CEO of CIIX. "Hemp oil is believed to have positive balancing effects on the mind and body of persons using them."
OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil, the line's base level product, is extracted and purified with raw materials from 100% organic farms in Colorado using a supercritical CO2 extraction technology. OptHemp products are GMO-free, making them attractive to consumers concerned about product source and purity.
"We believe that the desire for better quality of life in the Chinese community, coupled with fact that the aging population continues to grow, will lead to continued growth in the alternative health sector and increased demand for natural hemp-based health products," says Wang. CIIX is confident that its OptHemp product line will lay a solid foundation for the Company's entrance into the legal hemp industry and the alternative health sector."

ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. Launches CBD Biotechnology Inc. In British Columbia, Canada









PR Newswire




Jun 14, 2017 8:10 AM EDT













 


















































  SAN GABRIEL, California, June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) ("CIIX" or the "Company"), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that it has incorporated CBD Biotechnology Inc. in British Columbia, Canada. CBD Biotechnology Inc. will focus on research, development and distribution of health products, including hemp-derived cannabidiol ("CBD") products, as well as hemp-based food and beverage products. In April 2017, fulfilling a campaign pledge, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced legislation to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Canada by the middle of 2018. Canada will become the second country to completely legalize marijuana as a consumer product. The law will require purchasers to be at least 18 years old, and it will limit the amount they can carry at any one time to 30 grams. While the federal government will license and regulate growers, each of Canada's provinces will need to decide exactly how the drug will be distributed and sold within its boundaries. "I am delighted about the incorporation of CBD Biotechnology Inc.," says Warren Wang, founder and CEO of CIIX. "CBD Biotechnology Inc. is strategically located in British Columbia, Canada, known to be a cannabis friendly province. The British Columbia cannabis industry produces 40 percent of all Canadian cannabis, making cannabis among the most valuable cash crops in the province. While CIIX has been laying the groundwork to enter the legal cannabis market for some time, the complete legalization of cannabis in Canada provides another great opportunity for CIIX to enter the market." "The incorporation of CBD Biotechnology Inc. is a promising step forward towards CIIX's goals to enter the medical marijuana industry. Through its expansion into Canada, CIIX aims generate significant revenues through sales of CBD-based health products, while helping the nearly one million Chinese in Canada to improve their overall health," concludes Wang.  About ChineseInvestors.com (OTCQB: CIIX)   Founded in 1999, ChineseInvestors.com endeavors to be an innovative company providing: (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified); (b) advertising and public relation related support services; and (c) retail, online and direct sales of hemp-based products and other health related products.

ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. Announces its New Subsidiary Chinesehempoil.com, Inc. and the Launch of its First Premium Hemp Health Product Line 'OptHemp'Back to CIIX Snapshot

Share Story8:01AM ET 5/24/2017 PRNewswire



SAN GABRIEL, California, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --
ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) ("CIIX" or the "Company"), the premier financial information website for Chinese-speaking investors, today announces that Chinesehempoil.com Inc., established last month as a wholly owned subsidiary of CIIX, will officially launch its own premium hemp health product line 'OptHemp,' which will include the Company's first private label product, OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil.
The OptHemp products will be available at http://www.ChineseHempOil.com, the Company's official bi-lingual site. CIIX will use multiple sales channels to implement its sales plan including online sales, retail sales and direct marketing. As part of its plan, CIIX is close to completing construction on its first retail store, which will be among the first retail stores to offer premium hemp-based products along with other health products in San Gabriel, CA. The Company is expected to open the retail store this June in an optimal location within one of the city's premier Chinese consumer districts.  
 "I am very pleased to announce the launch of our first premium OptHemp product," says Warren Wang, founder and CEO of CIIX. "Hemp oil is believed to have positive balancing effects on the mind and body of persons using them."
OptHemp Ultra Premium Hemp Oil, the line's base level product, is extracted and purified with raw materials from 100% organic farms in Colorado using a supercritical CO2 extraction technology. OptHemp products are GMO-free, making them attractive to consumers concerned about product source and purity.
"We believe that the desire for better quality of life in the Chinese community, coupled with fact that the aging population continues to grow, will lead to continued growth in the alternative health sector and increased demand for natural hemp-based health products," says Wang. CIIX is confident that its OptHemp product line will lay a solid foundation for the Company's entrance into the legal hemp industry and the alternative health sector."
About ChineseInvestors.com (OTCQB: CIIX)
