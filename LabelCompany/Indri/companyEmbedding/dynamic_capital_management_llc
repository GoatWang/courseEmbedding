Dynamic Capital Management, Inc.
 














Introduction
 














record of having outperformed the S&P500 on average by 1-2% after fees and commissions, per year, over the last ten years, as detailed in our performance numbers.
 
We don�t take risk because we want to, but because without the potential of the added returns available if one invests wisely in equities, investors aren�t likely to reach their investment goals. Our Wealth Accumulation Analysis identifies the likely wealth generating impacts across different asset allocations and fee assumptions, so you can see how important those things are to investors.
 
If you aren�t already retired, the question often becomes how much money do you need at retirement in order to live the life you want, and what do you have to do between now and then to get there? That is why the asset allocation and investment decisions are so important. Our Retirement Planning Guide shows you how we help clients understand their financial future under various assumptions.
 
Finally, Dynamic Capital Management has special expertise in the management of taxable portfolios, utilizing its patented Efficient Tax software in order to minimize taxes, but not at the expense of future after-tax wealth generation.
 
Please let us show you how we can help you reach your retirement and financial goals
 
 
 
 














Dynamic Capital Management, Inc., is a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) that specializes in the conservative management of Separate Taxable, IRA, Roth, SEP, Trust, College and other stock and bond portfolios. Unlike a Stock Broker/Financial Advisor, who, as a salesperson, has no fiduciary duty to protect the client�s interests in terms of fees, and who often acts with investment prejudice, an RIA is a fiduciary with the authorized discretion to make investment decisions on behalf of the client. And as such, an RIA has a legal, moral and ethical duty to always act in the client�s best interests. 
 
What an investor purchases from their investment management program is after-fee performance, relative to the risk they are taking. One doesn�t want bond performance from an equity portfolio. Beyond that, in the end, it is really one�s after-tax, after-inflation and after-fee performance that determines your wealth generation success. Our fee is 1% of an account value per year. Stock Broker/ Financial Advisors typically cost 2-3% once all their fees, sales commissions, and third party management fees are taken into account. Siphoning off a costly disproportionate share of wealth generating potential.
 
Our bond portfolios contain only high quality investment grade securities, and our stock selections, as a Large Cap Value manager, are designed to take the least amount of risk necessary in order to capture equity returns. As a result, DCM enjoys the enviable track
