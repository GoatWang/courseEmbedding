Coates Family History “Of the Coast”
 



The name Coates is of ancient origin and was written in the earliest records as De Cote (meaning from the coast). It was a Norman name and the letter “a” was added to help in the correct pronunciation in English. The “A” occurs in the spelling as early as 1331, when in the fourth year of Edward III, William De Coates was Lord of Coles DeVille in Leicestershire, England, and again in 1347 John De Coates, with an “a” held lands in Lincoln, although the name was generally written Cotes until the seventeenth century.
There are landed proprietors bearing the name Coates in England, Wales and Ireland. The first Coates family arrived in Ireland in the early 1700s. Shortly after arriving in Ireland, the family bought land in Kildare around Donadea, Kilcock and Ovidstown from the Aylmer family, where they built their family Estate at Knockanally. They also had a house in Brighton, England.
Matthew Coates Esq. built the original Knockanally House, which was to stand for almost 200 years. This was built in the late 1700’s and he was the first of four generations of the Coates family to own Knockanally. He was known to locals as “Miner” Coates, a reference to mines he owned in Africa. His son William Coates Esq. built the present Knockanally House in 1843. He was the local magistrate in the area of Enfield. The estate remained the Ancestral home of the Coates family until 1942 when it was sold to the Irish Land Commission and re-destributed to Irish families. The House still remains today and is the Club House of the Knockanally Golf Course. Nowadays, the family is spread out over five counties, Dublin, Wicklow, Westmeath, Meath and Kildare.

 
The Coates family moved to Dublin in the 1885 and opened a piano factory. Joseph Jennings Coates from Eccleshill in Yorkshire, England, was a composer, pianist and piano tuner. His wife Jessie Coates was a professor of Music from Exeter in Devonshire, England. Since then the family have always had a very musical background. His son, Ernest and his wife Emily were also pianists and music teachers. Most of their children including Harold, Richard and Frederick became musicians, able to play, repair and tune many instruments. In time both Richards and Fredericks children followed in their footsteps, forming several bands that played all over England and Ireland.

Engine Inventor Accused of Fraud


By DIANA B. HENRIQUES


Published: July 23, 1994









                    To the self-chilling beverage can and the speed-boosting horseshoe the Federal Government would now add the Coates Rotary Valve Cylinder Engine, developed and promoted in the last four years by George J. Coates, a New Jersey inventor.        

                    Like the beverage can that can't, and the speedy horseshoe that wasn't -- both features of earlier unrelated schemes that cost public investors dearly -- the Coates engine is now described by securities regulators as a device chiefly useful for generating cash for its inventor.        

                    Lawyers from the New York regional office of the Securities and Exchange Commission went to court yesterday morning against Mr. Coates, 53, of Wall, N.J. In a civil case filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the S.E.C. accused Mr. Coates of lying about the merits of his invention and using those falsehoods to illegally sell $6.5 million in stock to nearly 400 people across the country.        

                    Hours later, Mr. Coates was arrested at his New Jersey office by United States Postal Service inspectors, acting on a criminal complaint signed by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. The complaint charged Mr. Coates with one count of mail fraud in connection with his solicitation of investors.        

                    "Many of these investors were neither wealthy nor sophisticated" and were induced to invest their savings on the basis of Mr. Coates's claims, Herbert J. Cohen, an S.E.C. lawyer, said in an affidavit filed in the civil case. The S.E.C. charged that Mr. Coates had used much of the money he raised for his own personal expenses, including the purchase of $1.1 million worth of real estate. Talk of Fleeing Country        

                    The lawyer for Mr. Coates, William J. Wolf of Lakewood, N.J., did not respond to messages left at his office yesterday. Mr. Coates remained in custody in New Jersey yesterday evening and could not be reached for comment. Under Federal procedure, he was to be arraigned before a magistrate, who would consider a bail request; prosecutors then must obtain a grand jury indictment within a specified period of time, or negotiate an extension with the defendant.        

                    In announcing the arrest, United States Attorney Mary Jo White noted that Mr. Coates had told investors, former business associates and even staff lawyers at the S.E.C. that he intended to flee the country if confronted by the authorities. If convicted on the mail-fraud charge, he would face a possible five-year prison term and a fine of up to twice the gross loss incurred by investors.        

                    According to the lawsuit, Mr. Coates falsely contended that his engine produced less pollution and ran more efficiently than conventional engines. He contended that its performance had been verified by independent testing laboratories; not true, the lawsuit said. In fact, the lawsuit charged that the only emissions tests done on the engine, in 1990 and 1991, showed that it generated so much pollution that it could not hope to meet Federal or state emissions standards.        

                    Nevertheless, many people were fooled by the inventor's claims, the S.E.C. said. Forged and Unreliable Tests        

                    Mr. Coates distributed forged and unreliable tests to potential investors, the commission said, and one test was an "unofficial tuneup test conducted at a local service station." He also said he had received "hundreds of thousands" of orders, the commission charged, when he actually had a single order for two prototypes, "which actually cracked or failed during preliminary testing."        

                    Magazines and newspapers -- including The New York Times -- featured his engine in articles published in 1992. Mr. Coates then distributed some of those articles to potential investors, along with newsletter articles and letters he prepared, according to court documents.        

                    As early as April 1990, the commission charged, Mr. Coates started selling stock to individual investors without registering it with the commission, as required by Federal law. Between April 1990 and the present, according to the commission, his companies raised $5.3 million through stock sales, and he personally raised an additional $1.2 million by selling shares that the S.E.C. said might have been counterfeit.        

                    Those unregistered stock sales have continued ever since, said Richard Walker, regional S.E.C. director -- which is why the commission asked Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday to freeze Mr. Coates's assets and appoint a receiver to take control of his business. Order to Freeze Assets        

                    Judge Wood signed an order at midday freezing the assets and appointing a receiver to oversee the company's affairs.        

                    The S.E.C. has asked Judge Wood to approve both a preliminary and a permanent injunction barring Mr. Coates from any future violatons of securities laws. In most S.E.C. cases, such requests are the legal equivalent of locking the barn after the horse is gone; but in this case, the agency argued in court yesterday, the requested injunctions against future violations have a very compelling goal: to stop Mr. Coates from continuing to sell his stock to the public.        

                    According to S.E.C. documents filed with Judge Wood before Mr. Coates was arrested, Mr. Coates continued to buy and sell his company's stock in violation of securities laws even while the commission was investigating him. "As recently as July 14, 1994, Coates admitted that he buys stock personally from investors and sells it to other investors," a commission lawyer noted in an affidavit. "Coates admits that he makes a profit on each of these transactions and that despite advice from an attorney to stop selling stock, he will 'keep doing it forever.' "

AND SECURE SUPPLIES LLC ARE NOW WORKING ON TOGETHER – THE PRODUCTION OF GASEOUS HYDROGEN FROM THE SUN’S RAYS AND FUELING COATES CSRV INDUSTRIAL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATORS WITH THIS HYDORGEN, TO GENERATE SEAMLESS, CONTINOUS ELECTRICITY – THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST “GREEN ENERGY” PROJECT OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD (SHAREHOLDERS’ UPDATE) Wall Township, NJ – (Globe Newswire – April 26, 2017) For Immediate Release: Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that our projects are moving forward.  The first industrial V12 QST 30-G4 engine for the hydrogen technology was delivered to the Coates plant in New Jersey.  Pictures can be viewed on the company website:  www.coatesengine.com. Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “Scientists around the world have been dreaming about tapping into the sun’s energy to produce electric power on earth.  That is exactly what we are working on now.  Harvesting hydrogen from the sun that can be used to fuel Coates CSRV industrial electric power generators.  We believe this will achieve the highest form of environmental “green energy” technology of its kind.  The Coates CSRV engines are most suitable to operate on gaseous hydrogen because there are no hot spots in the combustion chamber and valve overlap is not required because the volumetric efficiency is more than enough to charge the cylinders.  Conventional poppet valve engines will not work because the exhaust valve gets red hot and causes hydrogen to detonate (so-called pre ignition).  Poppet valves require larger overlap, which means exhaust and inlet valves are open at the same time.  This also causes hydrogen to detonate and backfire. Gaseous hydrogen is normally highly volatile and, may detonate easily, without proper safeguards.  Here, at Coates headquarters, we have developed proprietary technology over the past year to integrate the proper safeguards with our CSRV technology, enabling the gaseous hydrogen to be used safely as the main fuel source.   Patent protection will be applied for in the near future. The Coates CSRV engines were designed to operate on almost any engine fuel type and are particularly well suited to operate on gaseous hydrogen. We have received inquiries regarding large volumes of shares being trading on the open market.  Other than shares issued upon conversion of promissory notes issued six months ago or more, it is not possible to determine any specific reasons for our daily trading volume, because it is not within our control.  Update on activities planned in China:  Chinese officials have visited Coates’ headquarters and senior company directors visited China and executed an Exclusive License with Renown Power.  The Company has already received a $500,000 deposit and delivered one 150 KW N14 electric generator to Coates Power in China and received a $131,000.00 payment.  During the visit by a Chinese delegation last year, top executives expressed that they would put a proposal together for the Coates Company.  Mr. James Pang, the Company’s exclusive liaison agent to China to work on this with the Chinese government.  The Company is in negotiations for possible solar hydrogen projects in China and certain other countries in the UAE and Far East. Hydrogen-based ultra “green energy” projects will be beneficial to the environment, contribute to the reduction of global warming and reduce the volume of (CO2), (HC) and (CO) particles being introduced into our atmosphere, among other benefits.  This is consistent with the Company’s mission statement to benefit both the shareholders and humankind.” There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors. Safe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Contact Information: Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comWednesday - April 19, 2017COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

(OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) received official notification from Secure Supplies Mexico LLC that the solar system project in Mexico is budgeted for $412,000,000 USD over a three year period.  The Company will deliver 40 to 50 CSRV large industrial electric power generators to operate on gaseous hydrogen produced on site.Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “This is only one of the projects that our Company is involved in with Secure Supplies.  These projects work in the following way:  Secure Supplies set out on the site where hundreds of solar panels are erected producing electric power and producing hydrogen, which is stored in special expansion tanks.  When the sun goes down, the Coates CSRV electric power generators fire up operating on the stored hydrogen, which is produced by the sun.  These CSRV generators are synchronous and only produce the power required at any given time up to 50 M.W.  These are the most “green” projects ever.  These projects are many worldwide.  Coates CSRV engines are the only engine suitable to operate on gaseous hydrogen continuously.“Management believes this is a turning point for the Company that will benefit all involved.”There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comTuesday - March 21, 2017CUMMINS DELIVERS THE FIRST V12 QST30-G4 INDUSTRIAL ENGINE TO COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

(OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) has previously entered into a sublicense agreement with Secure Supplies USA LLC and Secure Supplies Mexico LLC (together “Secure Supplies”).  In addition to a $1 million licensing fee to be paid upfront, the Company will also fulfill orders to manufacture and deliver 35 1MW CSRV Hydrogen Powered Industrial Electric Power Generator Sets (“Hydrogen Gen Sets”) for the project in New Jersey and 40 1MW CSRV Hydrogen Gen Sets for Mexico.  Secure Supplies has informed the Company that it anticipates receiving funding from its customers to enable it to remit payments to us for the sublicense fee and deposits for 50% of the order value to be paid with orders it intends to place, beginning in March 2017. Company President and CEO, Mr. George J.

We were disappointed to learn that a number of people directly contacted Secure Supplies after we disclosed the news of our new sublicense. This is inappropriate and interferes in our relationship with Secure Supplies. Our business partners are intensely focused on successfully carrying out their own business plans, which did not include responding to such multiple inquiries. Exercising discretion in this regard is of great importance for everyone;▪  To date, we have not received the proposals from China for manufacturing operations that were previously promised to be submitted to us for review;▪  Mr. Nick Kontonicolas has not been able to secure financing for production operations to date.  While this has been disappointing, we have never exclusively relied on this financing and are continuing to work on alternative sources of financing. Accordingly, the Company expects to be able to continue to pursue its business plans;▪  The Company is planning expansion of its manufacturing capacity on readily available space on its own property in anticipation of the need to fulfill orders to be received from Secure Supplies; ▪  We have received inquiries about the relatively small staff at the Coates plant.  Our research and development activities involve scientific, proprietary technology and we prefer to limit accessibility until development of the technology reaches a stage where it can be patented. This is also a component of our strategy to preserve our working capital;▪  The Company continues to press ahead with its endeavors and business plans.” There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors. Safe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comThursday - December 15, 2016COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD., SECURE SUPPLIES MEXICO LLC AND SECURE SUPPLIES USA LLC HAVE EXECUTED AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT OF COATES CSRV “GREEN” ELECTRIC POWER (HYDROGEN) INDUSTRIAL GENERATOR SETS AND CSRV (HYDROGEN) ENGINES FOR THE COUNTRIES OF THE USA, CANADA AND MEXICO AND THEIR TERRITORIES   THE FIRST PROJECT PHASE PROVIDES FOR ORDERS AMOUNTING TO $400,000,000 USD Wall Township, NJ – (Globe Newswire - December 15, 2016) Coates International, Ltd.

Coates, comments:  “This is a promising opportunity to license an independent Chinese diesel engine and gen set manufacturing company.  We are already into some deals in China where the Chinese government is involved.  However, these deals take a considerably much longer time to complete than it does with independent companies.” Diesel engines, diesel gen sets and heavy diesel trucks are in trouble.  They simply cannot meet the world emissions standards. -  40 CFR part 1039 tier 4 emission standards certification required;-  40 CFR part 1065 exhaust emission test procedure for lab 15 field testing;-  40 CFR part 1068 general compliance provisions;-  40 CFR part 89 tier 3 earlier emissions standards and compliance program. Heavy trucks, buses and engines:-  Gross vehicle weight rating above 14,000 lbs. and some vehicles with gross weight rating between 8,500 lbs.;-  2012 to 2014 final rules for SCR EPA standards for diesel fueled systems requirements criteria pollutants – NOX, HC, PNL greenhouse Gas – CO2 – N2O and CH4. Euro 5 and 6 emissions regulations (EC) No 715/2007 (EC) No 692/2008 January 1, 2015 categories.

Coates, comments:  “When you remove 2,700 parts and components out of an engine and replace them with only two assembly CSRV shafts and make the engine operate better, quieter and smoother – this is an achievement in itself.  This Cummins poppet valve gen set is only a stand-by emergency unit.  When it is retrofitted, it will be a continuous prime time unit.  This will raise the value considerably.”There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comThursday - October 22, 2015CUMMINS POWER SYSTEMS, LLC DELIVERS THE FIRST NATURAL GAS 45KW ELECTRIC POWER GENERATOR SET TO COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRANSACTION WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST MARINE MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD, CSSC, A CHINESE COMPANY OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE’S RUPUBLIC OF CHINA – STOCKHOLDERS’ UPDATEWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – October 14, 2015) Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) the Company is pleased to announce that Mr. James Pang, exclusive liaison agent to China for the Company, is nearing the final stages of the agreements with CSSC and AF Power.  In this deal are Coates Power Ltd. China, Renown Power Hong Kong and the Company USA.-  Mr. Jack Perkowski, Company Director, will be returning to China next week and will be in contact with Mr. James Pang and the Company.-  CSRV parts and components are being manufactured by independent engineering companies in the USA.  Some parts, however, are taking much longer to produce than anticipated.-  The Company is working with Cummins Power to get production up and running of 150 KW, 200 KW and 250 KW CSRV natural gas electric power generator sets and the 35 to 50 KW stand-alone diesel and propane gen sets to fill orders.The Company has received feedback from shareholders and the financial community with respect to the fact the Company’s balance sheet, which is prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reflects less than $2.5 million of total assets. Coates owns many valuable assets that are not permitted to be reflected on its balance sheet by the GAAP rules. When an investor is considering acquiring another company, there are many factors that go into a decision making process that cannot be found in the GAAP-basis financial statements. This includes the fair market value of intangible assets, quality of the customer lists, value of vendor relationships, contingent liabilities, potential income tax exposure and unrecorded assets and liabilities. Explanatory comments from Barry C. Kaye, CFO: “While GAAP is required to be followed by every publicly traded company, Management believes that no single rule can anticipate every circumstance, and therefore, the resulting presentation of a Company’s financial condition may not be very meaningful, in some cases. Proof of this can be found in the hundreds of revisions to GAAP, some of which have been drastic changes, promulgated by the governing bodies that establish GAAP dating back to the 1950’s. In essence, GAAP is an art form that is continuously evolving in an attempt to improve the quality of audited financial statements. However, attempts to keep refining GAAP will likely continue indefinitely and many of the so-called improvements did not achieve the desired outcome and had to be amended and/or superseded. My early exposure to GAAP occurred in the early 1970’s and it is hard to believe how aspects had to be unlearned because of the unimaginable, pervasive revisions over the last 40 years.”The following stockholders’ update has been primarily prepared to provide a more meaningful picture of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.1.  Things to consider about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations:a.  Intellectual property, the Company’s most significant asset, which consists of exclusive rights to patents for manufacturing, sales and distribution, leasing and sublicensing of the Coates CSRV technology throughout the Western Hemisphere is not permitted by GAAP to be presented on its balance sheet. The Company has already received firm orders amounting to future sales of $142 million of CSRV Gen Sets, which is indisputable evidence that these patent rights have current value and substantial future value. The value of intangible assets is determined based on the reasonably expected future stream of cash flows that can only be generated by the owner of the intangible asset.b.  The Company owns numerous prototypes of products that demonstrate the benefits of CSRV technology including industrial generators, synchronous home generators, vehicles and automobile engines. These were all developed over the course of many years through research and development. In accordance with GAAP, all expenses incurred during research and development are required to be charge to expense as incurred, rather than showing the cost of the prototypes as assets on the balance sheet. None of these prototypes are included in the Company’s assets on its balance sheet. Almost $40 million has been expensed during the production of the prototypes, including approximately $10 million invested by the Coates family prior to inception of the Company, according to George J. Coates. These prototypes are used regularly to demonstrate the viability and benefits of the CSRV technology. These are unique assets that cannot be acquired or reproduced without incurring extensive costs over a long timeframe.c.  The Company’s results of operations also include certain expenses that are required to be recorded by GAAP which will never require any outlay of cash. This includes over $17 million for stock-based compensation since the beginning of 2014.There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors. Safe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comFriday - October 9, 2015COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

(OTC:PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has executed a Letter of Intent to manufacture and supply 5,000 CSRV natural gas electric power generators for distribution throughout the countries that comprise the Middle East and North Africa (“M.E.N.A.”).  Meetings with business executives from the Middle East are scheduled for Monday, September 28, 2015, at the Coates headquarters facility in New Jersey.The following is an update for our stockholders:-  A Cummins 250 KW natural gas electric power generator set will be delivered on November 7, 2015.  This gen set is a stand-by emergency unit.  It will be tested under full load:    -  For power output;    -  Fuel consumption; and    -  EmissionsThereafter, it will be dismantled, inspected and completely rebuilt and retrofitted with the Coates CSRV system, which eliminates 2,700 parts of the generator engine, including the engine oil from the head of the engine.  The Coates CSRV system utilizes only two rotating CSRV assembly shafts and 12 floating seals in place of all of the removed parts.-  The retrofitted CSRV gen set will be retested under the same test conditions; this is known as an A and B comparison, which is recommended by the E.P.A.  Mr. George J. Coates is an official inspector licensed by the Motor Vehicle Commission of New Jersey.-  Parts and components are being manufactured; a minimum of 100 pieces at a time.  This results in longer delivery lead times to the Company.-  Factory shut-downs, which are common over the summer, created delays as certain suppliers closed down for up to two weeks.-  The Company continues to move closer towards start-up of the licensing arrangements in China.  The Company has already shipped one 150 KW CSRV electric power natural gas generator to China and as soon as the final documents and agreements are executed for the manufacturing license, shipments will commence.Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “We have more orders in place than we can handle, which has created a desirable backlog to address upon commencement of production in large numbers.  Stops and starts are unavoidable in the beginning. As the time to fulfill these orders stretches out, certain orders can become stale.  For this reason we continue to press on to achieve our goal of manufacturing products in larger quantities.  The Company has engaged many parts and components manufacturers in the USA to supply these items.  These custom parts require a lot of time to be produced to our specifications. Our costs of procurement will be higher than we would expect to incur until we can place our orders in economic quantities.  We expect that we will be able to reduce these costs and generate acceptable gross margins.  We will be required to sell our products at competitive prices even though our CSRV systems are the most advanced in the world.  Our competitor’s gen sets are only suitable as stand-by emergency units and have a relatively short life span when operating on natural gas.  The Coates CSRV units will operate efficiently under continuous operation and deliver longer product life cycles, while requiring substantially less servicing.”There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement:This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax:  732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comFriday - August 28, 2015COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY CERTAIN PEOPLE, ENTITIES AND INSTITUTIONS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE COMPANY CAN CLAIM THAT THE COATES CSRV PATENTED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE WORLDWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – July 9, 2015) Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) Directors asked Company President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, to respond.Comments:The poppet valve engine has been around for more than 100 years and the poppet valves, camshafts, cam followers, rockers, tappets, and push rods are the biggest problems in the design of the poppet valve internal combustion engine.  Manufacturers have tried everything to make the poppet valve engine more efficient adding more poppet valves, overhead camshafts, turbo chargers, and super chargers.  All of these attempts have made very little improvements that will never meet with new regulations, EPA and carbon reduction world standards, it will be quite impossible to create a poppet valve engine that will meet the new required standards of internal combustion engine thermal efficiencies.On the other hand, here at Coates International, Ltd. we have designed the most advanced CSRV internal combustion engine in the world.  We claim this because of the following:1.  In a N.14 or 855 Cummins industrial engine, we eliminate 2,700 parts and components out of that engine.2.  Eliminate the oil pressure supply to the head of the engine and only utilize the engine oil pressure for the cranks shaft bearing supply to the lower half of the cylinders.3.  We replace all 2,700 parts with only two assembly CSRV rotating shafts and two floating seals for each cylinder.4.  Greater volumetric efficiency up to double that of the poppet valve has been achieved.5.  Utilizing higher compression ratios of 12 to 1 and up to 20 to 1.  Poppet valve engines in vehicles using gasoline are approximately 11 to 1, Caterpillar, Cummins 8.5 to 1 operating on natural gas and only operate as stand by emergency systems and not constant operating service.6.  The Coates CSRV engines have been independently tested and have proven results with more (H.P.), higher (R.P.M.s), lower fuel consumption, higher thermal efficiencies while producing lower harmful emissions released into our atmosphere.7.  The Coates CSRV engines operate on natural gas, CNG, LNG, propane, hydrogen, gasoline, diesel, and a combination of these fuels.8.  Poppet valves cannot operate higher than 8.5 to 1 compression ratio operating on LNG, CNG because the poppet valves are constantly in the combustion chamber and get red hot, when the constant temperature of the combustion chamber exceeds 2,400° F when it does, it manufactures No X. (oxides of nitrogen) and Co. (carbon monoxide) and uses much more fuel the engine thermal efficiency is reduced.  The governments around the world are asking the impossible of the poppet engine.9.  The Coates CSRV Spherical Rotary Valve System constantly rotates away from the combustion chamber heat using incoming air to cool the inlet and cooling the exhaust with a water cooling system through the center of the exhaust assembly shaft; 35 gallons of water per minute.10.  There is no servicing or adjusting or maintenance to the CSRV system for the life of the engine.11.  Engine oil changes are extended to 50,000 miles or more.12.  The reason poppet valve engines do not last operating on natural gas; this fuel does not have any lubricating properties contained in it.  As a result, number 1. piston rings in poppet valve engines wear out in a very short time.13.  The Coates CSRV engines incorporate the patented Coates sequential fuel injection system that injects a minute amount of diesel fuel in with the natural gas that the engine operates on.  This prevents excessive wear on number one piston rings.-  Incorporating higher compression ratios-  Incorporating greater volumetric efficiencies-  Less moving parts-  Utilizing a stoic metric mixture throughout the acceleration curve creates the highest thermal efficient internal combustion engineAll this technology was invented and designed by Mr. George J. Coates and his son, Gregory G. Coates, over more than 20 years.  Many patents have been awarded from the USA and from most industrial countries around the world.All of the above technology and design is the reason that we call this CSRV engine ((the most advanced internal combustion engine in the world.))  There is nothing out there that compares.I hope this answers all of the questions that we have been receiving.There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement:This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comTuesday - June 23, 2015COATES INTERNATIONAL SIGNS $20,000,000 EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – June 23, 2015) Coates International, Ltd.

ANNOUNCES BROKERAGE INDUSTRY IS DISSEMINATING FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT COATES TO THEIR CLIENTSWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – June 17, 2015) Coates International, Ltd. (OTC PINK: COTE) (the “Company”) was contacted by one of its shareholders advising company management that her stockbroker erroneously told her that the Company had declared a reverse stock split that would become effective by June 30, 2015. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The Company has not declared any reverse stock splits and has no intention of declaring any reverse stock splits. However, if, and only if, business conditions and other important factors change dramatically; and the board of directors and management of the Company determine that as a result of the changed circumstances, such a reverse stock split would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, then at that time, the Company may consider the possibility of a reverse stock split. This stockbroker also advised the Company’s shareholder not to buy any more shares of the Company’s stock because of this false information. This matter is being investigated by the Company. We were informed by the shareholder’s stockbroker that this information is provided as a data feed from a business segment of Securian Financial Services, which distributes information on stocks on a large scale basis to numerous stockbrokers around the country.Management of the Company felt that it is imperative that all Coates stockholders be made aware of the false and damaging information. This false information is likely discouraging prospective investors from buying shares of the Company’s stock which could be artificially depressing the price of the stock. Unfortunately, there is no realistic way to determine the extent of any damage to the stock price that might have resulted from this false information.The Company is diligently pursuing this matter with Securian Financial Services and expects to have this matter resolved as soon as practicable.There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement:This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comWednesday - June 10, 2015COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. – GREAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH THE COATES PATENTED CSRV MOST ADVANCED GREEN COMBUSTION ENGINES IN THE WORLD – STOCKHOLDERS’ UPDATEWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – June 10, 2015) Coates International, Ltd.

(OTCBB:COTE) (the “Company”).  There are no lubricating elements contained in natural gas.  Poppet valve engines that are put on this fuel only last for a short period and then the engines are totally destroyed.  Coates International, Ltd. designs and builds CSRV engines and gen sets specifically to operate successfully on flare off gas, landfill gas, CNG – LNG and other engine fuels. As referenced in the Associated Press via Yahoo Finance, April 2, 2015:  Bismarck, N.D. (AP) – Five oil companies must reduce their production at certain wells in North Dakota as a penalty for burning off more natural gas than allowed last month, a spokeswoman for the state’s Oil and Gas Division said.The state ordered the five companies to curb their production to 100 barrels per day at certain wells starting this month.  Alison Ritter, a spokeswoman for the division, said this is the largest number of companies and wells the state has sanctioned since new flaring regulations took effect on Jan. 1, the Bismark Tribune reported.The new rules require companies to capture at least 77 percent of natural gas produced during oil production.  Under a policy adopted by the State Industrial Commission, the 100-barrel restriction applies to companies that are not capturing at least 60 percent of the gas from the well.The division ordered production to be restricted at certain wells operated by Emerald Oil, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, QEP, Abraxas Petroleum and Enerplus.Coates International, Ltd. President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “Natural gas, flare off gas, and CNG-LNG do not have any lubricating elements contained in this fuel.  Poppet valve engines that are converted to operate on natural gas simply do not last very long without sustaining permanent and serious damage.  Poppet valves develop pitting and piston compression rings wear out in a very short time.  Scuffing and corrosion is also a problem as this gas is sometimes acidic.“Coates International, Ltd. has designed and developed the patented Coates Spherical Rotary Valve (CSRV) engine that operates on these gases successfully and continuously.-  There are no poppet valves in the combustion chamber of the Coates engines.-  The CSRV system is made of non-corrosive alloys.-  No engine oil is used to lubricate the CSRV system.-  A patented sequential injection system is incorporated that injects a minute amount of diesel onto the walls of the cylinders to lubricate the number one compression piston rings of each cylinder.-  Natural gas only contains 900 BTUs.-  The CSRV system utilizes much higher compression ratios.-  There is no maintenance required to the CSRV system for the life of the engine.-  Engine oil changing intervals are extended from 5,000 to 50,000 miles or more.-  Servicing downtime is reduced.-  Emissions are reduced dramatically.-  Fuel consumption is reduced by 18% or more.-  Much greater volumetric efficiency.-  Less vibration; smoother and quiet running.-  Higher engine thermal efficiency.“Diesel fuel contains a little over 3,000 BTUs, gasoline contains a little over 2,000 BTUs and natural gas contains only 900 BTUs.“Engine manufacturers do not produce engines that operate on flare off gas; they gave up trying.  Standard poppet valve engines operate on natural gas and incorporate an 8 to 1 compression ratio.  The CSRV incorporates a 12 to 1 ratio.  This makes a tremendous difference; in higher thermal efficiency, reducing fuel consumption and lowering emissions.“The Coates organization has a great future once it starts producing these CSRV products in large numbers and fills its customers’ orders.”There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement:This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comMonday - March 23, 2015OIL COMPANIES FLARE OFF 160,000,000,000 CUBIC METERS OF NATURAL GAS INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE EVERY YEAR; THESE COMPANIES MAKE HUGE PROFITS BUT SPEND LITTLE TO SOLVE THE POLLUTION PROBLEM THAT THEY CREATE; HERE AT COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. THE REMEDY TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM IS AT HANDWall Township, NJ – (Marketwired – March 23, 2015) Coates International, Ltd. (OTCBB: COTE) (the “Company”) Now North Dakota adds to this problem.  At some sites or wells there are no pipelines or compression stations to take the gas from the well heads.  There were approximately 40,000 oil wells drilled last year in the United States.  The United States is now among the top ten polluters in the world.  The toxic elements contained in flare off gas are (H2), (N2), (O2), (CO2), (C2), (C3) (1 – BUTANE), (1C4), (NC3), (H2S) and other sulfur compounds.  160,000,000,000 cubic meters of these pollutions are flared off into our atmosphere every year.  Coates International, Ltd. has the remedy to solve this problem with its most advanced patented CSRV engine generator technology in the world that operates on flare off gas, produces electric power, and can be used for compression and pumping while operating the oil rig; solving the pollution problem, saving billions of USD, utilizing the waste gas that would have been flared off and making more profit for the company.Coates International, Ltd. President and CEO, Mr. George J. Coates, comments:  “There exists only a very small film of air around our little planet.  We can only live and breathe up to approximately two miles high.  Above that, we would need a supply of oxygen.  So, it is like living in a bubble of air that surrounds the planet.  Those who say that climate change or global warming is a myth could not be more mistaken.  Every element and natural resource on this planet has a limited supply, even the oxygen we breathe.  Flaring off gas into our atmosphere will most definitely have an adverse affect on all living creatures including plant life and will surely contribute to climate change.This pollution is responsible for illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, heart and lung diseases and more all of which drives up the cost of our health care by billions of USD.Our planet and all life on it and our atmosphere are extremely fragile.  We should not guess or gamble and take chances with these most important aspects of our futures and lives as we depend on these for our existence.Here at Coates International, Ltd., over many years, we have designed and developed the most advanced CSRV combustion engine technology in the world that operates on flare off gas, CNG – LNG, propane, landfill gas, hydrogen and any other combustion engine fuels, producing the highest thermal efficiency while emitting ultra low emissions.  This is a win-win deal for the oil and gas companies.  Instead of wasting the gas we are using it to power whole systems, while making more profit for the companies and addressing this toxic waste practice.”There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.Safe Harbor Statement:This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Contact Information:Coates International, Ltd.Phone: 732-449-7717Fax: 732-449-0764www.coatesengine.comwww.mostadvancedengine.comriday - March 13, 2015TOP EXECUTIVES OF COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

COATES MAKES FURTHER INVESTMENT IN COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. PURCHASING ANOTHER 12,749,162 SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK BY CONVERTING NOTES AND ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADOPTION OF NEW STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN  On May 30, 2014, George J. Coates, President, Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder, converted $369,726 principal amount of 17% promissory notes, due from the Company to Mr. Coates, into unregistered, restricted shares of common stock of the Company at the closing price per share of $0.029 on May 30, 2014. Accrued interest on these notes was not converted and compound interest on this accrued interest will continue to accrue. These promissory notes arose from cash lent to the Company for working capital purposes from Mr. Coates’ personal funds. Accordingly, the Company issued 12,749,162 shares of its common stock to Mr. Coates. This transaction improves the Company’s balance sheet by reducing current liabilities by $369,726 and reducing the amount of the stockholders’ deficiency by the same amount. In addition, annual interest expense will be reduced by almost $63,000. Mr. Coates stated: “I agreed to convert these promissory notes because I wanted to express my continued confidence in the Company and also felt that the recent trading price range of our stock made this an attractive opportunity.”In addition, the Company established the 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"), which was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 30, 2014, subject to stockholder approval. The Stock Plan replaces the prior 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), as all authorized shares of common stock under that plan have been granted. The Stock Plan contains the same provisions as the 2006 Plan. The board of directors views the Stock Plan as an important asset to incentivize and retain the Company’s key employees. The Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock-based awards to employees, officers and directors of, and consultants or advisors to, the Company and its subsidiaries. Stock options and other stock-based awards may be granted under the Stock Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of the Company. A total of 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued upon the exercise of options or other awards granted under the Stock Plan. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which awards may be granted to any employee in a calendar year under the Stock Plan shall not exceed 12,500,000. The Stock Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee.There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of the above endeavors. This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Thursday, May 29, 2014 9:30 AM ET  CHINESE EXECUTIVES VISIT THE COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. HEADQUARTERS AND R&D PLANT IN NEW JERSEY IN AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ESTABLISHING PRODUCTION OPERATIONS OF COATES CSRV® ENGINES AND ELECTRIC POWER GENERATORS IN CHINA.  STOCKHOLDERS’ UPDATEMeetings with visiting executives from China were productive and positive.  Most of Company management’s requests and concerns were agreed upon and addressed to their satisfaction during the multi-day meetings. The Coates CSRV® Industrial power generators were demonstrated, operating under full load on natural gas, achieving output of more than 100 KW’s. In addition, a smaller standalone 4 cylinder, 35 KW propane-powered home generator, a gasoline-powered V-8 performance engine and the Coates Hydrogen Reactor, which transforms water into hydroxy gas used as the sole fuel source to power a 14-HP CSRV® engine were also demonstrated. All demonstrated engines and generators operated flawlessly. Mr. Coates’ comments: “The main purpose of these meetings was to clarify the details of our plans in China and make meaningful progress in our goal to establish mass production of CSRV® products. Our CSRV® products were designed to lower the production of harmful pollutants that are released into our atmosphere continually from the combustion process. These pollutants contaminate the air we breathe and our food supply, contribute to health problems and are adding substantial costs to healthcare worldwide.”The CSRV® engines operate on a wide range of alternative fuels such as; Natural Gas, CNG, LNG, Propane and Hydrogen, as well as all standard engine fuels. The thermal efficiency of the CSRV® engines is due to the design, which incorporates much higher compression ratios than the poppet valve. Greater volumetric efficiency of the CSRV® system, less load required to operate the valve system and the elimination of engine oil in the CSRV® system are the key enablers in the Company’s clean burning and “green” engine products. After the Company receives definitive documentation, management will visit China to inspect the new production facilities and begin laying out plans for production lines, warehousing and supply chain logistics. The Company plans to manufacture its full range of CSRV® products from the smallest engines to the largest industrial engines for trucks, buses and marine applications, among others.   There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of the above endeavors.  This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Wednesday, May 14, 2014 9:30 AM ET CHINESE EXECUTIVES TO VISIT COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

Coates stated:  “This transaction continues to move toward our objective of establishing manufacturing operations in China.  At the conclusion of this meeting we anticipate that we can move into the final stages of negotiations on this transaction with China. Additional developments on this transaction will be disclosed as they occur.” There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of the above endeavors. This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Friday, May 02, 2014 9:30 AM ET COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD PURCHASES 39,000,000 COMPANY SHARES FOR $1,000,000 ON APRIL 30TH 2014.Mr. George J. Coates, President and CEO of the company purchased approximately 39,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock for $1,000,000.  The company owed Mr. Coates approximately $1,900,000, most of which he advanced to the company over a period of time and the balance of which was from voluntarily deferring payment of his compensation. The result of this was to reduce the amount of Company’s current liabilities and increase the common stock outstanding and additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. As a result, it will not be necessary for the Company to satisfy this obligation by a cash payment. Mr. Coates is also the Company’s majority stockholder.Mr. George J. Coates commented: “I am committed to the Company and I made this further investment in the Company because the current stock price was attractive.” This is especially true because with more than 20 years of R&D that produced a number of advanced combustion engine prototypes operating on a wide array of alternative fuels, our Company is ready to move towards large-scale production as soon as it raises sufficient working capital. When I consider the value of the Company I take the following factors into consideration. Millions of dollars were invested into R&D over 20 years resulting in our proprietary technologies and a number of important working prototypes. The value of the intellectual property rights to manufacture, distribute and sublicense our patented CSRV technology is not reflected in our financial statements.We have received a substantial number of orders which will begin to be filled promptly after we are able to commence manufacturing operations.A distribution license for the territory of Canada was granted to a Canadian company for $10,000,000, with a remaining balance owed to the company of $4.8 million for the licensing fees. This licensing arrangement is expected to generate substantial orders once manufacturing commences.An additional distribution license for the territory covering the United States to be granted to this same Canadian company is currently in escrow. The licensing fee for the grant of this license is $50,000,000. This license would likely become active after the Company commences production.There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of the above endeavors. This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

COATES CSRV® electric power generator. This reactor reconstructs water molecules into a type of hydroxy gas that is used as fuel and after it’s used the exhaust turns back into water. Phase II testing will begin now.STOCKHOLDERS’ UPDATE Water to hydrogen project Phase II: The COATES Industrial hydrogen reactor design and construction was completed on April 10, 2014 and is now connected to a COATES industrial 100 K.W. CSRV® electric power industrial generator. Phase II testing for this H2 project will begin now.Our President & CEO Mr. George J. Coates’s comments:  This project was undertaken for a joint venture with a power company based in Colorado.  We have signed agreements in place and a number of other power companies are involved.  There are many governments and companies around the world attempting to use water as a source of fuel.  Here at COATES Headquarters and R&D plant we have designed and built a new type of device to reconstruct ordinary water into a type of hydroxy gas that can be used as fuel for combustion engines, and other types of engines including heating for homes are possible and other uses.   We have found a way of loosening the covalent bond of water molecules that makes it much easier to reconstruct water molecules into a type of hydroxy gas. After it is used it turns back into water. We utilize all of the water molecules (not part of them) there are no byproducts leftover.  The energy used to loosen the covalent bond does not require extra energy used, it’s already there. Water H2O RD 1.000 (4°C): MP 0.000°C. B.P. 100,000°C in the gas phase water consists of single molecules in which the H-O-H  angle is 105° the structure of liquid water is still controversial. Hydrogen bonding of H2O…H-O-H imposes a high degree of structure. Current experimental studies supported by x-ray scattering have short-range order regions; which are constantly disintegrating and reforming. This ordering of the liquid state is sufficient to create the density of water approximately 0°C because of its angular shape. Water molecules have a permanent dipole moment in addition it has a strong hydrogen covalent bond and has a high dielectric constant. Pure liquid water is very weakly dissociated into H2O and OH ions by self ionization. More stable fuel can be produced by adding a type of carbon H2O(G) + C(S) → CO(G) + H2 (G) and the reaction can be used for the production of fuel.The secret is to produce more fuel energy than the energy it takes to produce the fuel or HOH gas. We will start our Phase II testing now and have the answers to these questions when all tests are completed.  The potential of this project is unknown at this time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of the above endeavors. This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed on the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Wednesday, April 9, 2014 8:00 AM ETCOATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. - Two US Navy carrier jet pilots and an engineer visited the Company’s headquarters where they observed a demonstration of the COATES Hydrogen Reactor powering a COATES CSRV® engine operating on water molecules reconstructed into Hydroxy Gas.Many distinguished visitors were in attendance at our open house where the line-up of COATES CSRV® engines were demonstrated operating on alternative fuels such as; Natural Gas, CNG, LNG and Propane. In Addition, the Coates Hydrogen Reactor was activated, whereupon it successfully generated Hydroxy Gas on the spot to power a Coates CSRV engine, thereby validating the feasibility of producing engine fuels from the reconstruction of water molecules into hydroxy gas.Mr. Coates’s comments: This Coates Hydrogen Reactor could be the ultimate “green” technology. We convert water molecules into a type of Hydroxy Gas using all of the water molecules without generating any by-products and without utilizing any ambient air. This is made possible because as the converted hydroxy gas is utilized to power the engine, it immediately reverts back into water from the exhaust.  We are working on Phase II of this project which should be completed shortly, after which, testing will commence.  We have plans to test this system on industrial generators, jet engines, and pulse rocket engines.There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Licenses for this application are available to suitable dealerships and other qualified truck engine servicers. The CSRV® system could meet President Obama’s recently announced objectives for new lower emission standards and reduced fuel consumption. Furthermore, the CSRV® system can be adapted to enable the truck engines to operate on alternative fuels and mixtures of fuels. Phase II of our hydrogen reactor project is progressing well. The second test will take place within approximately two weeks.  We have many energy companies interested in this project and a number of new patents will be applied for soon. Only water and/or sea water is needed as the fuel source, which is split into a form of hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas  maybe converted into liquid forms by adding other elements to the mix to produce fuel suitable for other applications.The Chinese transaction is still progressing. Mr. James Pang is in China negotiating this terms as our representative.  A few things that are slowing down the process include: bad weather, the Chinese New Year, and the fact that different regions of China speak different Chinese dialects, complicating translation and communications.COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. Open House meetings had a good two day turnout. Engines and Gen-Sets were demonstrated, including the COATES Hydrogen Reactor. A number of our original investors and stockholders are now involved in assisting the Company to raise new working capital to commence production here in the USA. We welcome their assistance.There are a number of transactions pending here in the USA for our company and we are diligently working on all of them.Mr. George Coates our President and CEO comments: The COATES CSRV® Retrofit Systems for heavy duty trucks could answer President Obama’s executive order to lower fuel consumption and reduce harmful emissions from heavy truck engines. We believe this is only possible with incorporating the COATES CSRV® system by retrofitting these trucks. There is no other alternative to achieve his objective for new tough standards to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. To achieve this you must raise engine compression ratios from 14-1 up to 20-1 and increase volumetric efficiency by at least 50% and enable the use of alternative fuel mixtures such as natural gas, CNG-LNG, liquid hydrogen, diesel, and combinations of these fuels. Here at COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD. we already have these systems in operation. When we retrofit our CSRV® systems to these engines, we eliminate 2,600 moving parts and components from the engine and replace them with only two moving CSRV® shafts that do not require engine oil.  Oil change intervals maybe extended to over 50,000 miles.  No servicing or maintenance to the COATES CSRV® Retrofit System is required.There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA REQUESTS NEW RULES TO CUT HEAVY TRUCK POLLUTION AND REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH 100 YEAR OLD POPPET VALVE TRUCK ENGINES.President Obama took another step to curb green house gas pollution on Tuesday last week without waiting for Congress as he directed his administration to develop new regulations to reduce carbon emissions from the heavy-duty trucks that transport the nation’s goods.Appearing in a grocery chain truck in a Washington D.C. suburb the President said that the Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency would draft new fuel economy standards for heavy trucks by March 2015. They could be completed a year after that as he rushes to put in place a new regulation structure before leaving office.Mr. Coates is a research scientist in the design and development of Power and Propulsion Systems of numerous types including gas turbines, steam turbines, pulse detonation rocket engines, internal combustion engines, and more.Mr. Coates’ comments:  It’s quite impossible to reduce fuel consumption and lower harmful emissions of heavy-duty trucks by any significant margin as they are designed today with the antique design of the more than 100 year old poppet valve.  For the following reasons:Poppet valves are permanently incased in the combustion chamber and are subject to constant heat of that chamber.  The instantaneous combustion is approximately 3,000°F (the constant temperature of the combustion chamber should not exceed 2400°F) if it does the engine will manufacture NOX (nitrous-oxides) a deadly pollution.  To lower the fuel consumption of heavy truck engines and reduce the harmful emissions produced it is necessary to raise the compression ratio and increase the engine volumetric efficiency.  This is not possible with poppet valve engines because when you raise the compression ratio you create higher combustion chamber temperatures.  Poppet valves get red hot and burn-out while producing much more harmful pollutants, pre-ignition occurs, and will waste more fuel.  Truck engine manufacturers already tried this with adding more poppet valves and incorporating turbo chargers. They failed to achieve success in creating a higher thermally efficient engine.Here at COATES INTERNATIONAL, LTD over many years we have designed and developed industrial Coates Spherical Rotary Valve (CSRV®) Engines precisely for this purpose.Most standard heavy duty truck engines incorporate compression ratios of 14-1.  The COATES CSRV® industrial retrofit truck engine compression ratios range from 15-1 and up to 21-1 and volumetric efficiency can be almost twice that of the poppet valve engine.  Our CSRV® engines will operate on a multitude of alternative fuels.  When we retrofit these engines, we eliminate 2600 parts and components, as well as the oil from a standard poppet valve system in heavy-duty truck engines. (If more technical or scientific information is required please contact the company). The COATES CSRV® engines and retrofit systems are fully warranted. We plan to grant licenses to suitable dealers for our heavy truck retrofit CSRV® systems.There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

PHASE TWO OF THE COATES HYDROGEN REACTOR PROJECT IS RAPIDLY MOVING SUCCESSFULLY FORWARD.Phase two of the Coates Hydrogen Reactor Project is moving forward with great success.Mr. Coates explains, “There are literally thousands of people and scientists researching the energy contained in water H2O all encountering the same obstacles or laws of science (energy in, less energy out). Here at Coates R&D plant we have come up with a new invention that weakens the quantum electromagnetic covalent bond of the atomic structure of molecules in water H2O. In water molecules the oxygen atom attracts the electrons in an OH covalent bond, the hydrogen has no inner shell of electrons to shield the nucleus and there is an electrostatic interaction between the hydrogen proton and the single pair of electrons on the oxygen atom in the associate molecules. Each oxygen atom has two associates pairs of electrons and can make hydrogen bond to two different hydrogen atoms. The strengths of hydrogen bonds are about one tenth of the strengths of normal covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonding does have significant effects on physical properties. It accounts for the unusual properties of water and for the relatively high boiling point of H2O, HF, and NH3 compared with H2S, HC1 and PH3."We have come up with a new device that weakens the covalent bond in water H2O molecules making it much easier to split water into hydrogen in larger quantities in a shorter time period. This new apparatus does not include more energy in to produce hydrogen it requires less energy in to split water into hydrogen.  No new energy is required to weaken the covalent bong of the water molecules. We expect to have the new reactor ready for testing in the next two weeks. We already have CSRV® engines operating on water split into hydrogen so we know it works."The Chinese New Year starts today. We believe it will go on for two weeks. We are ready to go when they are. Letters of Intent, preliminary agreements and nondisclosure agreements have all been signed and will be posted on our EDGAR filings.The Company is continuing talks with financers here in the USA for funding the start up of production here in America.Orders are still coming in for our natural gas industrial CSRV® engine generators from the oil and gas industry. We are now requesting 50% deposits with five months delivery time.We are hoping to have our products out in the market place in 2014. This will enhance the Company value and benefit our shareholders and all involved.There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

GEORGE J. COATES IS TO VISIT CHINA FOR MEETINGS WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REGARDING ESTABLISHING MASS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS OF CSRV PRODUCTS IN CHINA. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT OVER $1,500,000,000 WILL BE INVESTED IN THE PROJECT OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT TERM. PRELIMINARY AGREEMENTS AND LETTERS OF INTENT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXECUTED.The President and CEO is to visit China to meet with government officials and business executives from Chinese manufacturing companies involved in  establishing mass production operations of the Coates CSRV® products in China for distribution throughout Europe, the Far East, and the UAE. Investments in this project are expected to exceed $1,500,000,000. Many Coates products are to be produced including retrofit kits for many makes of engines including heavy trucks, busses, marine applications and more.Mr. Coates comments, “A lot of work and time has gone into this project. We must forge ahead as markets are opening up for our CSRV® products. Just think of it, we eliminate 2,700 parts and components of an industrial 6 cylinder engine and replace them with only two rotating CSRV® shafts and 12 floating seals and eliminate the oil service to the head of the engine. On a V12 engine we would eliminate approximately 6,400 components and parts. The production costs of all these parts and assembly is extremely costly but the CSRV® system could be approximately one tenth of the cost. I cannot wait to see the CSRV® systems in production. This is a game changing technology that I believe will revolutionize the combustion engine and generator industry. The Chinese engine expert is to visit our headquarters any day now and I will be visiting China in a matter of days after that.”Management is working with financiers to get production up and running here in the USA. We expect to get some results this month.Phase two of the hydrogen HOH project is progressing. Many new inventions have been created and cannot be divulged at this time until patenting process has been completed.Interests in dealership licensing from the oil and gas industry for industrial CSRV® natural gas engines and generators are heating up.Here at Coates we would like to wish all our stockholders’ a Happy New Year!There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Certain details of the Coates patented CSRV® engines will be explained and other proprietary details will be omitted. Numerous tests will be ran on different CSRV® engines. We should point out that Mr. Coates is a New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission Licensed Inspector and will be overseeing all of the tests and demonstrations that will be carried out for the Chinese visitor at the Coates plant.Mr. Coates comments, “This is a much better arrangement than shipping one test engine to China. We will demonstrate various CSRV® engines and natural gas industrial gen-sets under full load with all the equipment in operation. We were informed that this new visitor from China is a renowned engine expert. I look forward to this visit. This deal with China to establish Coates mass production operations is a very important step for the Coates Organization. It opens up new major markets for all of the Coates CSRV® products. After this visit we should be in a position to consummate the deal.”There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In attendance were Mr. John Kennedy PHD, Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Jeffery Hoffman, Accounts Manager, Mr. Charles A. Sheffield, President of Sheffield Capital Advisors, and investment banker Mr. Jack Killion Managing Partner of Eagle Rock Partners LLC and Manager of Eagle Rock Diversified Fund, LP. This meeting was in relation to funding the start up production operations of the Coates CSRV® products here in New Jersey, USA.Many Coates CSRV® products were demonstrated for the visitors including an industrial 100 KW CSRV® natural gas electric generator, a 35 KW stand alone CSRV® home propane generator, a V-twin 1600cc air-cooled CSRV® gasoline heavy cruiser Coates motorcycle, a V-8 high powered CSRV® racing engine and a 14 HP CSRV® air-cooled, one cylinder Coates engine operating on water split into hydroxy gas. All visitors expressed to Mr. Coates that they were highly impressed with the Coates CSRV® products and demonstrations. Mr. Coates comments, “Due diligence will start now and it normally takes 30 to 45 days until a decision is made. At the meeting many possibilities were explored for funding the start up of establishing production operations here in New Jersey. We are planning to start production operations small at first and ship out approximately 250 industrial units and reinvest our profits into the expansion of the Company’s production operations.  This will be a step by step process that I believe will grow rapidly and enhance company value and create new quality jobs that are really needed here right now. Even if we had large amounts of funding in place we still have to train all new employees, order parts and castings, etc. so it is a step by step process and takes time. The Company still has the Dutchess Equity Line of Credit for $20,000,000 in place with approximately $19,500,000 left and a Letter of Credit for $30,000,000 with two years left that the Company intends to utilize for its ramp up once initial cash funds are in place”We would like to take this opportunity to wish all of our Stockholders’ and business friends a Merry Christmas and Prosperous Happy New Year!There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the “Company”) has successfully completed the first phase of R&D of designing and manufacturing the first Coates water splitting reactor that produces hydrogel or hydroxyl gas on demand that is used to power a Coates CSRV 14 HP internal combustion engine.Management comments, Our Company is developing innovative solutions addressing environmental problems eliminating the cost of fuel and electric power generation with our hydrogen reactor project. Water is the only source of fuel used in the reactor. The Coates reactor splits the water and produces hydroxyl hydrogen that is used as fuel to operate the CSRV engine. The next phase will be to adapt the Coates reactor to a home CSRV generator. Management is anticipating great future potential for this new Coates hydrogen reactor product.Mr. Coates comments, many companies and individuals are experimenting with hydrogen. For instance, BMW has a car operating on compressed liquid hydrogen. The only problem is the liquid hydrogen costs more than gasoline to produce, so that puts a stop on that. Other companies have busses operating on hydrogen sells that work but take up one third of the buses capacity and cost substantial amounts to produce. On the other hand, the Coates hydrogen reactor splits the hydrogen gas from water on demand. For instance, a 35 KW CSRV home generator would power the hydrogen reactor with a fraction of its output power to produce the hydrogen that the generator operates on. This would mean that electric power required for a home generator would be produced from water and the Coates reactor design is inexpensive to produce.If we can get the next phase on this hydrogen reactor project completed successfully the impact for the United States would be tremendous.Regarding the economy:This could create a new industryAbsolutely no harmful emissions producedA much cleaner environmentManufacturing of new productsThe creation of many new quality jobsExporting new products instead of importing themNew products bring in new moneyThis product could have a very positive effect on our Company and the country. The Company will press on with the next phase of the Coates hydrogen project, which will involve home generators and industrial generators. There can be no assurance made that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Stockholders Update: The Coates Water Splitting Hydrogen Reactor Was Coupled to 35 KW Coates CSRV Electric Power Generator and Operated on Hydroxy Gas (Hydrogen) as Its Sole Fuel Supply Split From WaterThe Coates water splitting hydrogen reactor was coupled to a 35 KW Coates CSRV electric power generator and operated on hydrogen, hydroxy gas, split from water as the only fuel source used to operate the machine.Mr. Coates states, "Hydrogen has quite a lot of explosive power; it was stated by some that there are 900 BTU's in hydroxyl gas. I am not sure if that is correct, we will find out exactly during our future tests. Imagine just putting water into your home generator to create the electric power for your home, including heating and cooling. I believe this is very possible. Hotels, factories, supermarkets and more all powered from water as fuel. Of course the system will have to be refined for commercial use now." The Company has signed with another US company to manufacture and commercialize the hydrogen reactor system and CSRV generator.The Company has numerous CSRV products developed and designed for production including 1 Cylinder, 2 Cylinder, 4 Cylinder, 6 Cylinder and 8 Cylinder engines. Home generators and natural gas industrial generators for the oil and gas industry, also the Coates CSRV 1600 ci heavy cruiser motorcycles. Over the past two years management traveled to numerous states, met with governors and state and city officials, wrote up proposals and inspected buildings, etc. The incurred costs, including company overheads of more than $2,000,000 USD, was mostly funded by the Coates family.The Company's plans have changed. The Company must start producing its products right away or it could lose its firm orders. Plans are in the works to start production in New Jersey first and then expand to other states if necessary. There are some offers on the table to establish production operations in other states.

Management has rejected the latest offer of incentives from the State of Oklahoma and, accordingly, will not proceed with the purchase of the Miami, OK manufacturing property. We have learned that this property has environmental problems including the presence of asbestos.Management has decided to pursue setting up manufacturing and production operations in another state that is more business-oriented and willing to provide better opportunities for the Coates planned production of its CSRV products. Management is working on securing a package of business and tax incentives with another state that could be finalized by the end of August 2012. However there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this endeavor.Management believes that we do not have competitors in this field because the patented CSRV system technology provides all of the following economic and environmental benefits:The Coates Spherical Rotary Valve System Technology provides the following benefits:Eliminates 2,700 moving parts that are incorporated in the 6-cylinder industrial 855ci poppet valve engines and replaces all these parts with only two assembly CSRV shafts.Eliminates the use of engine oil to the top of the engine. The CSRV system does not require oil service from the engine oil pressure system.Requires no servicing or adjustment for the life of the engine.Can operate on LNG-CNG, flare-off well-head gas, and landfill/syngas while producing ultra low harmful emissions.Is patented in most strategic locations worldwide.Is expected to generate strong demand from oil and gas companies, governments and others that have expressed interest in our CSRV engine generators. We have received projected requirements from our licensed distributor in Canada for over 11,000 units per year for the next five years.Is expected to substantially increase engine life expectancy when running on flare-off well-head gas or landfill gas. Our Canadian licensed agent has advised us that poppet valve engines, which are used by other engine manufacturers have short life expectancies when utilizing well-head flare-off gas, syngas, and wet acidic gas. To demonstrate this point, they have shipped poppet valve engines to us that burnt out in a matter of 2-8 weeks operating in the field.Expected reduction of servicing and maintenance down-time of approximately 75%.Servicing cost is expected to be reduced by approximately 60%.Flare-off well-head gas is the burning off of raw natural gas, a byproduct of oil production. 150,000,000,000 cubic meters of this natural gas is flared off into our atmosphere annually, known as waste gas. The dollar value of this waste gas is $30,000,000,000 USD discarded every year. This contributes to global warming and generation of poisonous elements from the flare-off gas, which include (H2), (N2), (O2), (CO), (C1), (C2), (C3), (1-Butene), (iC4), (NC4),(Trans-2-Butene), (CIS-2-Butene), (IC5), (NC5), (C6+), (H2S), and other sulfur compounds. Just one breath of these poisonous pollutants could kill a human being instantly.Coates International, Ltd. believes it can solve these problems with its patented CSRV products and technologies that will be utilized in the oil and gas industry for pumping, compression, and the production of electric power generated from waste gas that would have been otherwise discarded.Coates International, Ltd.'s mission is to utilize this flare-off waste gas in our industrial electric power CSRV generators. We believe this will generate revenues for all the companies that utilize CSRV products.Reduction of the consumption of fossil fuels.Lower the impact of flare-off gas that would otherwise be pumped out into our atmosphere causing global warming, worldwide health hazards, acidic rain, damaging vegetation, contaminating rivers, streams, drinking water, and oceans and causing changes in the weather patterns.We believe that when Coates starts producing and deploying large numbers of our CSRV products around the world, our technology will be able to make meaningful advances in addressing these environmental problems.  It is an arduous task that must be implemented and it will take time and a lot of skill and know-how in various aspects of business engineering. Here at Coates International, Ltd., we believe that our team is up to the task.This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our public filings with the SEC may be viewed and printed from the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.Friday, September 30, 2011 10:05 am EDTCoates International, Ltd. ("the Company") is concentrating most of its efforts on setting up a manufacturing plant in the U.S. to produce its revolutionary, green technology, internal combustion engine products here in the United States and to pursue a corporate mission to create numerous permanent skilled jobs where they are needed most. Coates must first raise sufficient new working capital in order to ramp up production of these products. The Company intends to distribute its products both domestically and through foreign export which would contribute to the U.S. economy by bringing foreign capital into the US.These products which incorporate the Coates CSRV system technology can operate on natural gas which would lower the consumptions of fossil fuels such as oil and possibly reduce the demand in the U.S. for imported foreign oil.Update on transaction in China - Based on the difficulty of working with the management of S.W.T., a heavy equipment manufacturer in China, with which the Company engaged in extensive negotiations over a period of more than a year, management has determined that the risk of proceeding to merge with S.W.T. is greater than anticipated. Accordingly, the Company will instead consider working out an alternate, simpler approach to enable it to have access to the manufacturing capabilities of S.W.T. while affording both companies the opportunity to benefit from CSRV system technology related manufacturing activities.Update on Dubai Power Plant Project – As the Company continued to pursue the opportunity to construct the first power plant in Al Najaf, Iraq, significant additional details came to light which caused Coates' management to conclude that, at the current time, it is not feasible to ensure the security of the employees and contractors that would have been assigned to the construction project. Coates has placed the project on hold at this time and will revisit this opportunity in the future if it is determined that the region has become more stable and secure.Management stated that the company's plans for the new production plant in the United States is to manufacture Industrial Electric Power Natural Gas generators, including Home gen sets,  operating on propane and to retrofit trucks and busses to run on a combination of Natural gas and diesel.About Coates International, Ltd.: Coates has been developing over a period of more than 15 years a patented spherical rotary valve CSRV Internal Combustion Engine invented by George J.

In this securities fraud action brought under the Securities Act of 1933 ("the Securities Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the Commission" or "the SEC") brings this motion for summary judgment seeking (i) a finding that George J. Coates ("Coates") violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 U.S.C. § 240.10b-5, and (ii) an order requiring Coates to pay civil penalties under the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d) ("the Remedies Act"). Coates claims that no civil penalties should be assessed against him. For the following reasons, this court GRANTS the Commission's motion in part and denies it in part and DENIES Coates' motion.
I. BACKGROUND
A. Procedural History
On July 22, 1994, the Commission filed a complaint against defendants, alleging, among other things, that they violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by making false and misleading statements to investors in connection with the sale of Coates International, Ltd. ("CIL") securities. See Pl.'s R.  56.1 Stm't ¶ 1.1 The Commission sought a permanent injunction, disgorgement, and civil penalties against defendants pursuant to the Remedies Act. See id. ¶ 3. On July 22, 1994, the court, upon application made by the Commission on the same date, granted the Commission interim relief, including an asset freeze as to both Coates and CIL and the appointment of a temporary receiver for CIL. See id. ¶¶ 3, 112. The temporary receiver was directed to take possession of the assets of CIL, to operate the business, and otherwise to maintain the status quo. See July 10, 1996 Opinion and Order at 2-3. In violation of this order, Coates' wife subsequently withdrew $25,000.00 from their joint bank account. See id. ¶ 113.
On February 21, 1995, the court entered two final consent judgments as to Coates and CIL ("Coates Judgment" and "CIL Judgment") that settled this matter, except for the issue of civil penalties against Coates. See id. ¶¶ 5, 6. The consent judgments permanently enjoined Coates and CIL from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. See Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 5. The consent judgments also required Coates and CIL to disgorge certain funds and other assets. See id. The extent of the defendants' obligations to disgorge funds depended, in part, on the results of a registered rescission offer to certain purchasers of CIL stock. See id. The CIL Judgment discharged the temporary receiver and, instead, named him as Special Master of CIL, with specific responsibilities including assisting in CIL's compliance with the consent judgments. See July 10, 1996 Opinion and Order at 3.
The Coates Judgment froze all of Coates' assets other than certain salary. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 114. The day after issuing the Coates Judgment, Coates transferred his patents relating to the Coates System to his son, Gregory Coates, in exchange for one dollar, in violation of the asset freeze. See id. ¶ 115. Paragraph XI of the Coates Judgment stated that the court reserved judgment as to the issue of civil penalties against Coates and set forth certain factors for the court to consider in determining whether civil penalties are warranted. See id. ¶ 6.
The consent judgments permanently enjoined Coates and CIL from violating federal securities laws and called for the disgorgement of certain funds and assets. See id. ¶ XX. The CIL Judgment required that CIL make a registered offer ("rescission offer") to all persons who purchased CIL stock from CIL or Coates from April 24, 1990 to February 21, 1995, the date of the rescission offer. Coates and CIL were required to pay the amounts due to the rescinding shareholders. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stm't ¶ 117. Prior to the distribution of funds to rescinding shareholders, the Special Master was to propose, subject to approval and order of the court, a plan of distribution. See id. ¶ 118.
Without seeking the court's prior approval, Coates and CIL solicited and obtained money from some of its remaining shareholders, placed that money in a bank account outside of the Special Master's control, and used that money to pay some of the rescinding shareholders. See id. ¶ 119. The rescission offer has been fully implemented, with only thirty-two shareholders electing to receive cash in exchange for their CIL stock. See id. ¶ 116. The total amount due to the rescinding  shareholders was $1.27 million plus interest at the annual rate of five percent. See id. ¶ 116. Of the total amount due, $900,000 had been invested by two shareholders. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 119B.
The CIL Judgment required that CIL file a registration statement with respect to the rescission offer by July 21, 1995. CIL's registration statement was twice amended, and on November 13, 1995, the Second Amended Registration Statement was declared effective. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 9-10. Coates signed the Second Amended Registration Statement on CIL's behalf in his capacity as, among other things, president, principal executive officer, and a director of CIL. See Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 6.
The proceedings in this case were initially before Judge Wood who oversaw the defendants' conduct after the entry of the consent judgment as well as the funding of the rescission offer. Judge Wood entered multiple rulings some of which appear in the following court orders: (1) Opinion and Order dated July 10, 1996, (2) Opinion and Order dated August 19, 1996, (3) Order dated August 20, 1996, and (4) Order dated September 9, 1996. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 12.
In the August 19, 1996 Order, the court rejected a request by Coates that he not be ordered to relinquish tangible assets to satisfy his obligation to fund payments to the rescinding shareholders unless a sale of his intangible assets (i.e. his CIL stock) failed to generate the required amount of cash, and held as follows:
In light of the bad faith that Coates has demonstrated throughout this litigation as set forth in this order and in my previous orders in this matter — see, e.g., [August 1994 Order] (describing withdrawal of $25,000 from Coates' bank account by Coates' wife after Coates had been informed of temporary restraining order issued by this court freezing his assets) — I order Coates to transfer title to his automobiles and his Rental Property to the Special Master on or before August 26, 1996.
See id. ¶ 120. In this order, the court also required Gregory Coates to transfer the patents back to Coates on or before August 26, 1996 and required Coates to transfer the patents to the Special Master on August 27, 1996. See id. ¶ 121. In the August 20, 1996 Order and the September 1996 Order, the court extended the deadlines for performance of the transfers to September 10, 1996. See id. ¶¶ 122, 123. The September 1996 Order also required Coates to transfer title to all of his automobiles to the Special Master on or before September 10, 1996. See id. ¶ 123. The transfers of the patents and automobiles did not take place on or before September 10, 1996. See id. ¶ 124. Untimeliness aside, Coates complied with every order of the court. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 124B.
The rescission offer process concluded in July 1997. On July 15, 1997, Judge Wood entered an order detailing the conditions under which the Special Master would be discharged. See July 15, 1997 Order. The July 15, 1997 Order also appointed the Special Master to be Escrow Agent for the sole and limited purpose of holding the escrow sum which consisted of the interest payments still owed to two of the rescinding shareholders. See id. On July 31, 1997, Judge Wood entered an Order Vacating Restraints Against George J. Coates. In this order, the restraints imposed in Paragraph VII of the Coates Judgment were vacated; however, the terms of all prior orders including the Coates Judgment were not altered. See July 31, 1997 Order.
On July 10, 1997, Coates filed a motion seeking an order stating that civil penalties would not be assessed against him,  and in response, the Commission sought leave to file a motion for summary judgment against Coates. On September 30, 1997, the court granted the Commission leave to bring its motion for summary judgment.
In an order dated August 8, 1997, Judge Wood denied defendants' request that they should be relieved of their obligation under the CIL Judgment and subsequent court orders to pay interest to the Quintas Trust and Rainer Heubach, two of the rescinding shareholders. See August 8, 1997 Order. The interest is in an escrow account under the auspices of the Escrow Agent, the former Special Master. See id. By order dated August 15, 1997, Judge Wood denied a motion by defendants to reconsider her August 8, 1997 order; however, she granted a stay of the August 8, 1997 order to pay interest until a final decision was issued on the summary judgment motion regarding civil penalties. See August 15, 1997 Order.
This case was subsequently transferred from Judge Wood to Judge Motley on October 30, 1998. The pending motions were argued orally on November 19, 1998.
B. Factual History
Coates founded CIL in October 1991. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 13. Coates is the inventor of the Coates System, a spherical rotary valve system for use in piston driven internal combustion engines. See id. ¶ 16. CIL's business is entirely dependent on the activities of Coates, who at times has been CIL's president, chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling stockholder. See id. ¶ 15. From CIL's inception through November 1, 1995, the Coates System has been the only actual or potential source of operating revenue for CIL. See id. ¶ 19. During the period subject to the rescission offer, Coates and CIL sold a total of 478,350 shares of CIL stock at prices of $5, $10, $20, and $30 per share for a total of $6,578,000 in gross proceeds. See id. ¶ 14.
1. EPA Emissions Standards
All new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines for sale in the United States intended for road use, including those with engines equipped with the Coates System, are subject to Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") emissions standards and are required to pass a series of tests known as the Federal Testing Procedure or "FTP" tests. See id. ¶¶ 20, 22; see also 40 C.F.R. § 86.090-5. Included in the regulations governing the emissions testing component of the FTP tests is a requirement that emissions tests be conducted using a machine known as a chassis dynamometer ("dynamometer"). See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 21; see also 40 C.F.R. § 86.135. Prior to July 1994, CIL never received a Certificate of Conformity from the EPA stating that engines modified with the Coates System were in compliance with applicable federal emission standards. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 25. Before July 1994, the EPA never conducted any emissions tests or other tests involving the Coates System or vehicles associated with the Coates System, CIL, or Coates. See id. ¶ 26.
Engines modified with the Coates System technology were tested in February and August 1990 and February 1991 at Compliance and Research Services, Inc. ("Compliance"), an independent motor vehicle emissions testing contract laboratory recognized by the EPA. See id. ¶ 27. The tests performed at Compliance indicated emission levels of pollutants that were substantially higher than the maximum emission levels permitted under EPA regulations. See id.; see also Pl.'s Ex. 2, CIL Second Am. Registration Stmt. ("Reg.St.") at 26. The Compliance tests were performed  using a dynamometer, a machine required under federal regulations to be used for independent emission testing. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 21, 28. Coates received the results of the Compliance tests and was aware of the EPA emissions standards. See id. ¶¶ 29, 32.
CIL disseminated two documents dated December 6, 1991 to CIL stockholders and other potential investors regarding a private offering of CIL's Series A Preferred Stock ("December 1991 Offering"). See id. ¶ 33. These documents were titled "Confidential Private Offering Memorandum" and "Confidential Information Memorandum." Coates testified at his deposition that he personally provided Deloitte & Touche, the preparers of the December 1991 memoranda, with the information contained therein. See id. ¶ 35. The Confidential Information Memorandum stated that the Coates System modified "engine, under an internally supervised test, far surpassed the emission standards imposed by the [EPA]." Id. ¶ 38. It further stated that the "Coates engine emits significantly lower levels of pollutants than a conventional engine" and listed comparisons between the federal emissions standard and the Coates System in a chart entitled "Comparative Analysis":

   Exhaust       Federal    Coates
  Emissions     Standard    System   Improvement
  CO (%)           1.2        .2         84%
  HC (ppm)         220        97         56%

Pl.'s Ex. 10, Confidential Info. Mem. at 13. However, the testing that produced the figures listed above was not performed at an independent motor vehicle emissions testing contract laboratory recognized by the EPA. The tests were performed at a CIL facility using a machine other than a dynamometer. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 40. Additionally, neither memoranda referenced above disclosed anything about the 1990-91 Compliance test results, which stated that the emissions levels of a Coates System engine were substantially higher than the maximum levels permitted by the EPA. See id. ¶ 41.
In a letter to CIL stockholders and other potential purchasers of CIL stock dated March 24, 1992, Coates wrote:
[O]ur first official independent emission test has indicated the lowest emissions in the world.... Further testing with the EPA is continuing and should be completed within six weeks depending on the schedules.
Pl.'s Ex. 7, Larkin Decl. Ex. A, March 24, 1992 Letter. The letter also contained a solicitation to purchase additional CIL stock. See id.; see also Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 45.
Similarly, in a letter to CIL stockholders and other potential purchasers of CIL stock dated March 26, 1992, Coates wrote:
The results of our first independent emissions test have demonstrated that our design produces the lowest level of pollutants in the world. In fact, we have eliminated some of the most harmful emissions completely.... With further EPA testing going as scheduled, this phase of evaluation should be finished within six weeks.
Pl.'s Ex. 8, Carter Decl. Ex. A, March 26, 1992 Letter. The letter also contained a solicitation to purchase additional CIL stock. See id.; see also Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 49.
2. Harley-Davidson
The Coates System was evaluated by two third parties, Harley-Davidson, Inc. ("Harley") and Chrysler. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 52, 68. Under a July 1991 prototype manufacturing agreement between CIL and Harley, CIL tried to retrofit the Harley motorcycle engine with the Coates System. Harley conducted dynamometer tests of two prototype motorcycle engines modified with Coates System technology.  On or about November 1991, Harley notified Coates of the test results on the Harley modified engines. See id. ¶ 53. The test results indicated that the prototype engines had experienced mechanical durability problems. See id. ¶ 52; see also Pl.'s Ex. 11, Tuttle Dec. Ex. B, Harley November 18, 1991 Letter to Coates ("Harley Letter"). Specifically, the Harley tests revealed several problems with the modified Harley engines, including "valve train failure" of one engine and deep score marks on the rear exhaust rotary valve and seal of the second engine. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 54; see also Harley Letter. The Harley engineers offered the following conclusions as to the two prototype engines equipped with the Coates System in their November 18, 1991 letter to Coates:
1. The reliability /durability of the current rotary valve trains systems for both engines is inadequate.
2. The exhaust valve to seal clearance appears to be insufficient.
3. The durability of the valve seal itself is questionable.
4. The engine power potential of the 1340 is far less than required, probably due to the insufficient flow through the ports and valves.
Harley Letter.
The November 18, 1991 letter advised Coates of Harley's decision to discontinue testing of the engines equipped with the Coates System in favor of other projects. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 53; see also Harley Letter. The letter did not terminate the relationship with Coates; rather, it stated that Harley would contact Coates "regarding possible ways to proceed with the development of your system for our engines." See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 56G; see also Harley Letter. Harley sent a subsequent letter to Coates dated December 3, 1991 in which it reiterated its continued interest in the Coates System. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 56G; see also Pl.'s Ex. 11, Tuttle Dec. Ex. C, Harley December 3, 1991 Letter to Coates. As of November 1, 1995, CIL had never developed a retrofitted Harley motorcycle engine using the Coates System that was acceptable to Harley. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 58.
CIL's December 1991 Confidential Information Memorandum stated that engine prototypes were sent to a "major motorcycle manufacturer." Id. ¶ 59. However, the memorandum did not disclose any of the problems detailed in the November 18, 1991 Harley letter to Coates. See id. ¶ 61. In a letter to CIL stockholders and potential purchasers of CIL stock dated July 6, 1992, Coates wrote: "Harley-Davidson's Motorcycle Engine is now complete, and has been returned to them for final testing. We are awaiting their response." Pl.'s Ex. 8, Carter Decl. Ex. B, July 6, 1992 Harley Letter. The letter also contained a solicitation to purchase additional CIL stock. See id.; see also Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 65. The July 6, 1992 letter does not disclose any of the problems detailed in the November 18, 1991 Harley letter to Coates. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 66.
3. Chrysler
Chrysler also evaluated engines equipped with the Coates System technology at a CIL facility in May 1993. See id. ¶ 68. In a report dated June 3, 1993, Chrysler engineers advised that "no further activity should be undertaken at this time" due to the lack of "documented proof ... to substantiate that [the Coates] valve train system functions as claimed." Pl.'s Ex. 12, Chrysler Report. The report further detailed other shortcomings of the Coates System, noting that "documented proof of component durability, system performance, and emissions characteristics does not exist" and that the "[c]omponents demonstrated at the [CIL facility]  were not acceptable to the [Chrysler] engineering team for the proper material application nor their tribology interaction." Id. However, the report did describe the potential benefits of the Coates System, including its potential for good emission development and its compatibility with alternative fuels. See id. Coates admitted that he received a copy of the Chrysler report and stated that the "tests [CIL] had to date at that time were not anywhere near the standards that Chrysler has for testing." See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 74.
The following statement appeared in a letter distributed to CIL investors dated August 4, 1993:
Seven engineers from Chrysler Corporation visited our plant where we demonstrated a number of engines for them. They appeared very interested and are making reports to the Executive Committee in Chrysler Corporation. We are waiting to hear from them.
Pl.'s Ex. 13. This letter stated that the private stock offering was closed and that no more stock could be sold under that offering. See id. The letter also contained an offer to refund the investment of any investor who was not satisfied with CIL's progress. See id.; see also Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 76. The letter did not disclose the contents of the June 1993 Chrysler Report.
4. Orders for the Coates System
In order to continue the development and testing of the Coates System, CIL required substantial amounts of additional funding. See id. ¶¶ 79-80. Prior to July 1994, CIL did not obtain the necessary additional financing to complete the development and testing of the Coates System nor did it have the manufacturing capability to mass produce or sell the Coates System engines. See id. ¶¶ 81, 87. Prior to November 1, 1995, CIL had neither the manufacturing capacity nor the financing to manufacture or sell engines on a commercial scale. See id. ¶ 88. Furthermore, CIL had no binding sales orders for the Coates System engines as of November 1, 1995. See Reg. St. at 22-24.
The March 24, 1992 and March 26, 1992 stockholder letters both state that CIL had firm orders for 5000 four-cylinder Coates Spherical Rotary Valve Systems per year. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 91, 92. The July 6, 1992 stockholder letter states: "We have just received five engines from Italy for which the actual order has gone up to 15,000 yearly." Pl.'s Ex. 8, Carter Decl. Ex. B, July 6, 1992 letter. Additionally, a potential purchaser of CIL stock received from CIL a letter, dated October 7, 1992, that states: "We have orders for literally hundreds of thousands of engines for different types of applications." See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 94; see also Pl.'s Ex. 14, Hervert Decl. Ex. B, October 7, 1992 letter. All of these letters included solicitations to purchase CIL stock; however, these letters did not disclose CIL's inability to manufacture or sell engines on a commercial scale nor the fact that none of the orders taken by CIL were firm orders. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 95-97; see also Reg. St. at 22-24. In his sworn testimony before the Commission on July 14, 1994, Coates explained that because final testing and other prerequisites to "mass production" had yet to be completed, "it is going to take at least twelve months or maybe two years" before CIL can "have a product to sell to the public." Pl.'s Ex. 4, Coates Tr. at 396-98.
5. Defendants' Failure to Disclose the Reassignment of the Coates System Engine Patents
Five patents for the Coates System were issued to Coates before February 5,  1991. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 99. Coates assigned these patents to CIL on December 5, 1991, one day before the beginning of the December 1991 Offering. See id. ¶ 100. These assignments were disclosed in the appendix to the Confidential Information Memorandum. See id. ¶ 101. On January 1, 1992, CIL's Board of Directors authorized the transfer of these patents back to Coates in return for an exclusive right to negotiate licenses and transfers of technology associated with the patents, and on June 29, 1992, CIL reassigned the patents to Coates. See id. ¶¶ 102, 103. These authorizations and reassignments were not disclosed by Coates or CIL prior to July 1994. See id. ¶ 104.
C. The Arrest and Incarceration of Coates in Connection with this Action
On July 22, 1994, the same day that the Commission obtained the initial injunction from the court, Coates was arrested by members of the United States Postal Inspection Service pursuant to a warrant for his arrest issued that same day by the court on the basis of a mail fraud complaint sworn to by a Postal Inspector and approved by an Assistant United States Attorney. See Pl.'s R. 56.1 Reply Stmt. ¶ 3A. The complaint was based in part on evidence obtained by the Commission through its inquiry and investigation. See id. Because Coates was arrested late on a Friday, he was incarcerated in the Mercer County jail until he could be moved to the federal jail in Manhattan. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 3B. Upon application by counsel, Coates was released from jail by a federal magistrate in the Southern District of New York on July 26, 1994, without the posting of cash or a bail bond. See id. ¶ 3C. Coates was incarcerated for five days. See id. ¶ 3D. The Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York dismissed the criminal charges. See id. ¶ 3F.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment should be granted where "[t]he pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). To defeat a summary judgment motion, the opposing party must "[c]ome forward with `specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.';" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). A genuine issue is present when the record would enable a reasonable trier of fact to return a verdict for the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.
B. Coates' Violations of the Exchange Act
The Exchange Act and its promulgating regulations prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities. See 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. With respect to fraud, the Exchange Act provides:
It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange ... (b) To use or employ, in  connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). Pursuant to the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 was promulgated to prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, providing that:
It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
To have violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, defendant must have: (1) made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he had a duty to speak, or used a fraudulent device; (2) with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. See SEC v. Monarch Funding Corp., 192 F.3d 295, 308 (2d Cir.1999).
To be material, misrepresented or omitted information must be relevant to the investor's decision of whether to purchase, hold, or sell the relevant security. See, e.g., Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-232, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). An omission of information is material if there is "a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the `total mix' of information made available." TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976).
"The scienter needed in connection with securities fraud is intent `to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,' or knowing misconduct." Press v. Chemical Inv. Servs. Corp., 166 F.3d 529, 538 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting SEC v. First Jersey Sec., 101 F.3d 1450, 1467 (2d Cir.1996)). As a threshold matter, the complaint must allege that Coates acted with sufficient scienter. See SEC v. U.S. Environmental, Inc., 155 F.3d 107, 111 (2d Cir.1998). The complaint in this case alleges that Coates acted knowingly or recklessly. "Knowing misconduct" is sufficient to establish liability under securities fraud statutes. See First Jersey Sec., 101 F.3d at 1467. Furthermore, "[i]n order to establish scienter ..., [it is sufficient that] the plaintiffs ... identify circumstances indicating conscious or reckless behavior by the defendants." Chill v. General Elec. Co., 101 F.3d 263, 267 (2d Cir.1996).
Although determining issues of materiality and scienter on summary judgment requires caution, this court nonetheless has the authority to determine these issues on motion. See FED. R. CIV. P. 56. As to the issue of materiality, the Supreme Court has articulated the following standard:
 The determination [of materiality] requires delicate assessments of the inferences a "reasonable shareholder" would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him, and these assessments are peculiarly one for the trier of fact. Only if the established omissions are "so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality" is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriate for summary judgment.
TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126. As to the issue of scienter, this court notes that determining a person's subjective state of mind is peculiarly inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment. Here, however, as discussed below, various representations were clearly material and knowingly false and various omissions were obviously material and were known to Coates.
This court notes that the Commission's motion for summary judgment was supported by extensive documentation of Coates' fraud violation. The documentation included a transcript of Coates' testimony taken during the Commission's investigation2 and documents drafted by the defendant himself, including the registration statement Coates submitted to the Commission. In response to the Commission's well-documented motion, Coates' Revised Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts admits the truth of the majority of material facts set forth in the Commission's Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts.
After considering the parties' voluminous submissions, this court finds that Coates has violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act by knowingly making misrepresentations and omissions of material facts in connection with the sale of CIL securities. Coates violated the Exchange Act with respect to his statements regarding (1) the EPA emissions testing, (2) CIL's interactions with Harley-Davidson, (3) the orders for the Coates System, and (4) the reassignment of the patents from CIL to Coates. This court also finds that Coates statements regarding Chrysler did not violate the Exchange Act.
1. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding EPA Emissions Standards
Coates' statements concerning the EPA emissions testing violated the Exchange Act's anti-fraud provisions. In the Confidential Information Memorandum, which was disseminated to potential investors regarding a private offering of CIL stock, Coates stated that the Coates System engine "under an internally supervised test, far surpassed the emissions standards imposed by the [EPA]." In addition to this, the memorandum included a chart listing comparisons between the federal emissions standards and the Coates System engine emissions.
The "internally supervised test" was not performed at an EPA-approved laboratory, and was not performed with a dynamometer. Thus, the statements in the memorandum and the comparisons in the chart give a false impression that the Coates System engine's emissions levels would satisfy EPA requirements. Coates states that the statement in the memorandum is accurate because the tests referred to were conducted internally. However, Coates does not address CIL's inability to  determine through its in-house tests whether its engines could comply with EPA or federal requirements without the use of a dynamometer. "A recklessly inaccurate and incomplete placement memorandum cannot be used to gull and lull an investor." Spatz v. Borenstein, 513 F.Supp. 571, 585 (N.D.Ill.1981).
Furthermore, Coates represented in the March 24, 1992 and March 26, 1992 stockholder letters that the Coates System engines were either being testing by the EPA or were undergoing some sort of EPA testing. Coates also referred to an independent emissions test which indicated that the Coates System engines had the lowest emissions in the world. On the whole, the letters indicate that the independent emissions test is related to official EPA testing or EPA testing requirements. In fact, the EPA never conducted any testing of the Coates engines and the only EPA testing facility that did conduct tests on the Coates System engines found emissions levels higher than those required by the EPA.
Coates states that EPA emissions standards are irrelevant because Coates was designing racing engines which do not require EPA approval. Although it is true that one of CIL's targeted industries was the racing industry, the December 1991 Offering memoranda and the Second Amended Registration Statement do not limit the applications of Coates System engines to racing. In addition, Coates himself made the EPA standards relevant by promoting their importance in his correspondence with stockholders and potential stockholders. This court therefore finds that Coates statements in the December 1991 memorandum and in the two March 1992 stockholder letters were material misrepresentations. See, e.g., Hoffman v. Estabrook & Co., Inc., 587 F.2d 509, 514-15 (1st Cir.1978) (representation that company had working prototype of computer system violated the anti-fraud provisions where company at most had developed laboratory and engineering prototypes). Furthermore, Coates knew at the time that he made the statements in the December 1991 memorandum and the March 1992 stockholder letters that the EPA was not involved in any testing of the Coates System and that the independent testing to which he referred was not conducted by an EPA-approved facility.
Coates also omitted information in the December 1991 memorandum and in the March 1992 stockholder letters concerning the results of the Compliance tests which revealed emission levels that were substantially higher than the EPA maximums. Coates states that the Compliance test results are immaterial because (1) the purpose of the testing was not to access emissions levels; (2) the vehicle tested was not equipped with an air pump, EGR valve, or catalytic converter which are pollution reduction devices; and (3) following the Compliance tests but prior to the December 1991 memorandum, Coates made improvements to the Coates System. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 27C, 32A; see also Pl.'s Ex. 4, Coates Tr. at 278-282. Given the lapse of time between the Compliance tests and the December 1991 Offering, the possible improvements made to the Coates System between those times, and the lack of pollution reduction features on the vehicle tested, this court cannot determine whether a reasonable investor would have found the Compliance test results "so obviously important" as to make their omission material. See TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126.
2. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Harley-Davidson
Coates' omissions regarding Harley's test results do not violate the Exchange  Act; however, Coates' misrepresentations with regard to Harley's testing of the Coates System do violate the Exchange Act's anti-fraud provisions.
In November 1991, Harley notified Coates that it was discontinuing testing of the Coates prototype engines because of mechanical durability problems. However, Coates did not include this information or the adverse results of the evaluations performed by Harley in the December 1991 Offering memoranda. Coates contests the materiality of the Harley test results stating that the malfunctions were caused by the Harley engineers' disregard of Coates' test protocol. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 56C. Coates also states that the only parts of the engine that were damaged were Harley parts rather than Coates parts. See id. ¶ 56E. The issues raised by Coates concerning the November 18, 1991 Harley test results prevent this court from deciding whether a reasonable investor would find the omission of this information important given the total mix of information. See TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126. Therefore, this court cannot determine on this motion whether the omission is material.
However, in addition to omitting information regarding the Harley test results, Coates represented in the July 6, 1992 stockholder letter that Harley was conducting final testing on the Coates System engines. It is not contested that, in fact, Harley was not conducting final testing on any Coates engines. Coates' misrepresentations concerning Harley's testing of the Coates System in the July 6, 1992 stockholder letter are material. See, e.g., Alna Capital Assocs. v. Wagner, 532 F.Supp. 591, 598 (S.D.Fla.1982) (finding inaccurate report concerning nature of distributorship agreement for major product material). Coates acted with the requisite scienter since he knew before July 6, 1992 that Harley had discontinued testing and was not engaged in any final testing of the Coates prototype engines.
3. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Orders
Coates violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act due to his misrepresentations and omissions regarding orders for Coates System engines. The March 24, 1992, March 26, 1992, July 6, 1992, and October 7, 1992 stockholder letters Coates mailed to investors or potential investors indicated that CIL had a substantial number of firm orders for engines equipped with the Coates System. The Commission has demonstrated that CIL did not possess firm orders for Coates System engines at the time these letters were mailed. The Commission also points to Coates' investigation testimony and the registration statement he submitted to the Commission to show that Coates knew his representations concerning the orders were misleading. Coates' misrepresentations concerning firm orders and his omissions concerning CIL's inability to manufacture or sell engines commercially are material since there is a substantial likelihood that such information would be perceived as important by a reasonable investor. See, e.g., SEC v. Research Automation Corp., 585 F.2d 31, 35 & n. 8 (2d Cir.1978); see also San Leandro Emerg. Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 810 (2d Cir.1996) ("[M]aterial facts include not only information disclosing the earnings and distributions of a company but also those facts which affect the probable future of the company and those which may affect the desire of investors to buy, sell, or hold the company's securities.") (quoting SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 849 (2d Cir.1968)).
 Coates has failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the orders. He submits that CIL did possess thousands of engine orders. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 83H. However, his attached exhibit of these orders shows that the orders are either provisional orders or inquiries establishing interest in ordering; Coates' exhibit does not demonstrate any firm orders. See Def.'s Ex. 44. Coates also submits that although CIL could not manufacture engines at the time his statements were made, CIL was capable of entering into licensing agreements. See Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 84-88. However, Coates cannot establish that any licensing agreement was successfully finalized during the time his statements were made.
4. Mispresentations and Omissions Regarding the Patents
Coates also violated the Exchange Act with respect to his representations regarding the ownership of the five patents for the Coates System. By assigning his rights in the Coates System patents to CIL one day before the December 1991 Offering and failing to disclose that CIL authorized the transfer of the patents back to him in January 1992, Coates fraudulently misrepresented his rights to the Coates System. These misrepresentations and omissions are material and relevant to the sale of stock because the ownership of the engine patents was one of CIL's principal assets. Furthermore, Coates clearly acted with the requisite scienter since he knew the patents were transferred to him by CIL in January 1992 and did not update the information contained in the December 1991 memorandum. Cf. IIT v. Cornfeld, 619 F.2d 909, 927 (2d Cir.1980) (accounting firms "do have a duty to take reasonable steps to correct misstatements they have discovered in previous financial statements on which they know the public is relying."); SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, 458 F.2d 1082, 1095 (2d Cir.1972) ("Post-effective developments which materially alter the picture presented in the registration statement must be brought to the attention of public investors."). Coates does not deny the reassignment of the patents and the nondisclosure of this reassignment.
5. Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Chrysler
Coates' statements and omissions concerning his dealings with Chrysler did not violate the Exchange Act. Coates received the results of the Chrysler test, dated June 3, 1993, which found no proof that the system functioned as claimed. The results of the Chrysler tests were not included in the August 4, 1993 stockholder letter, and furthermore, this letter misrepresents Chrysler's level of interest in the Coates System.
The court need not decide whether the omission and misrepresentation concerning Chrysler contained in the August 4, 1993 letter are material. The omission and misrepresentation do not fall within the ambit of section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 because they were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. See Superintendent of Insur. of New York v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U.S. 6, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971) (indicating that where a deception touches a purchase or sale of securities the "in connection with" requirement of section 10(b) is met). In fact, the letter was only sent to stockholders of CIL and explicitly stated that the private stock offering was closed. See, e.g., Kellman v. ICS, Inc., 447 F.2d 1305, 1308-09 (6th Cir.1971) ("Their ownership of that stock inherently would make them `purchasers' in the sense that at some point in time they would have had to acquire the stock. However, their ownership of the stock does not make them `purchasers'  ... since their `purchases' occurred prior to the alleged fraud of which they complain.").
C. Civil Penalty Against Coates
As discussed above, this court finds that Coates has violated federal securities laws due to: (1) his misrepresentations concerning EPA emissions standards in the December 1991 memorandum, the March 24, 1992 stockholder letter, and the March 26, 1992 stockholder letter; (2) his misrepresentations concerning Harley's testing of the Coates prototype engines in the July 6, 1992 stockholder letter; (3) his misrepresentations and omissions concerning orders for Coates System engines in the March 24, 1992, March 26, 1992, July 6, 1992, and October 7, 1992 stockholder letters; and (4) his failure to correct the statement contained in the December 1991 memorandum with regard to ownership of the Coates System patents.
Due to Coates' violations of the Exchange Act, the Commission asks this court to impose civil penalties against Coates pursuant to the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3) ("the Remedies Act").3 The Commission suggests that each of Coates' violations should fall under the third tier of civil penalties available under the Remedies Act and that the total amount imposed should be $100,000. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)(B)(iii) (allowing $100,000 penalty against a natural person if violation involved fraud and created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons).
The Remedies Act was enacted to achieve "the dual goals of punishment of the individual violator and deterrence of future violations." SEC v. Moran, 944 F.Supp. 286, 296 (S.D.N.Y.1996). The House Report on the Remedies Act states:
The Committee believes that the money penalties proposed in this legislation are needed to provide financial disincentives to securities law violations other than insider trading.... Absent a criminal prosecution or a private suit for damages ... even the defendant who makes a deliberate decision to violate  the law and causes significant harm to the markets does not risk any monetary sanction more severe than an order of disgorgement. Disgorgement merely requires the return of wrongfully obtained profits; it does not result in any actual economic penalty or act as a financial disincentive to engage in securities fraud. A violator who avoids detection is able to keep the profits resulting from illicit activities. Currently, even a violator who is caught is required merely to give back his gains with interest, leaving him no worse off financially than if he had not violated the law. The Committee therefore concluded that authority to seek or impose substantial money penalties, in addition to the disgorgement of profits, is necessary for the deterrence of securities law violations that otherwise may provide great financial returns to the violator.
H.R.Rep. No. 101-616, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1379, 1384-86. The Exchange Act provides that any civil penalty is to be determined by the court "in light of the facts and circumstances" of the particular case. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3).
Paragraph XI of the Coates Judgment specifically reserved the issue of whether civil penalties would be imposed against Coates in light of all facts and circumstances. The Coates Judgment set forth the following factors for the court to consider in determining whether to impose civil penalties:
(1) The egregiousness of the defendant's conduct;
(2) The degree of the defendant's scienter;
(3) Whether the defendant's conduct created substantial losses or the risk of substantial losses to other persons;
(4) Whether the defendant's conduct was isolated or recurrent;
(5) The success of the Rescission Offer as measured by whether those shareholders who request a return of their investment receive a refund equal to the full amount of the money invested;
(6) The report of the Special Master to be prepared following the completion of the Rescission Offer; and
(7) Compliance by the defendant with the terms of this Final Judgment. The court may also consider whether the amount of any such penalty that would otherwise be appropriate should be reduced due to the defendant's demonstrated current and future financial condition.
Def.'s Ex. 23, Coates Judgment ¶ XI.
Coates argues that penalties should not be imposed against him because (1) he has complied with the terms and provisions of the Coates Judgment, including successfully completing the rescission offer, and (2) he believed that entering into the consent agreement with the Commission prevented the Commission from seeking such civil penalties. In opposition, the Commission argues that the greatest weight in determining the level and amount of penalties should be given to (1) the egregiousness of Coates' violations, (2) the degree of Coates' scienter, (3) the risk of loss to investors, and (4) Coates' lack of remorse and misconduct during the litigation.
After reviewing all of the evidence, this court finds that civil penalties are warranted in this matter. Coates' argument that he would not have entered into the Coates Judgment had he known that the Commission would later seek civil penalties against him is belied by the very terms of the consent judgment. Coates agreed to the terms of the Coates Judgment which included an express reservation of jurisdiction to this court to consider the appropriateness of a civil penalty. Therefore, this  court rejects Coates' argument that a civil penalty should not be imposed in a dispute that is settled. See, e.g., SEC v. Custable, 1996 WL 745372 (N.D.Ill.1996) (imposing a civil penalty for securities act violations despite fact that defendants had voluntarily entered into consent agreements with the SEC).
As to the seriousness of the violations and Coates' degree of scienter, Coates' anti-fraud violations went to the heart of the investment he was soliciting. The Coates System was both the centerpiece of Coates' promotional campaign and the sole potential source of future revenue for CIL. Thus, misrepresentations and omissions concerning the durability and marketability of the Coates System created a greater amount of risk to investors than they were aware of because they lacked the information necessary to access the pros and cons of their investment.
In addition to his violations of the Exchange Act, this court must also consider Coates' misconduct while this case was under the supervision of Judge Wood. Coates twice violated the terms of the asset freezes in place against him, did not comply with the provisions governing the rescission offer, and created repeated delays in carrying out the terms of the Coates Judgment, thereby requiring continuing intervention by the court.
Coates has also failed to take responsibility for his own actions and has instead placed blame for the difficulties this litigation has caused CIL on the Commission. Coates claims that the Commission brought this litigation in bad faith and seeks the ruin of CIL. Coates has also stated that the Commission has a "personal vendetta against Coates." Def.'s R. 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 5R. In SEC v. Moran, the court cited the defendant's penchant for "blaming others, including the SEC for his own conduct" and "downplaying of the violations for which he is liable" as additional factors warranting the imposition of a civil penalty. See SEC v. Moran, 944 F.Supp. at 296.
Against the above factors must be weighed the success of the rescission offer, the small number of investors who elected to take part in the rescission offer, the degree of support evinced by the non-rescinding shareholders, Coates' cooperation with the Special Master, and the arrest and incarceration of Coates. Although Coates did not conduct the rescission offer in the manner specified by the court, the rescission offer was ultimately successfully completed. Only 32 investors with a total investment of $1.27 million chose to participate in the rescission offer, and of those 32 investors, two shareholders had invested $900,000 of the $1.27 million. Those shareholders who did not elect rescission have repeatedly petitioned this court in favor of Coates voicing their belief in his commitment to CIL and to the best interests of CIL's shareholders. Coates also cooperated with the Special Master during the time that the Special Master was involved with the operations of CIL. Finally, it cannot be overlooked that Coates was arrested and spent five days in jail at the commencement of this action.
Given the above factors and considering them within the context of all of the facts and circumstances, this court finds that Coates should be assessed civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 per violation. This court has discussed four violations of the Exchange Act, and therefore, Coates is ordered to pay a civil penalty of $40,000 to the Treasury of the United States.
D. Interest Held by Escrow Agent
Having resolved the issue of summary judgment and civil penalties, this court vacates the August 15, 1997 stay of the  August 8, 1997 order to pay interest to the Quintas Trust and Rainer Heubach. This court therefore orders the Escrow Agent to oversee the distribution of the monies held in the escrow account to the Quintas Trust and Rainer Heubach.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons detailed above, the Commission's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part and denied in part. Coates' motion for a finding that no civil penalties shall be assessed is DENIED.
The court finds that Coates has violated federal securities laws and ORDERS that Coates pay $40,000 to the Treasury of the United States.
This court also VACATES the August 15, 1997 stay and ORDERS the Escrow Agent to oversee the payment of interest to the Quintas Trust and Rainer Heubach from the monies held in the escrow account designated for this purpose.
The Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly.
SO ORDERED.
