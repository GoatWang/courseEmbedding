2017 New Venture Pitch CompetitionFriday, April 7, 2017Northwest-Kansas CityOverview | Guidelines | Event and PrizesOverviewCollege students, high school students and members of the community interested in presenting their business ideas in a competitive setting are invited to register for the fifth annual New Venture Pitch Competition at Northwest Missouri State University-Kansas City.
The deadline to enter is Friday, March 3, 2017. The competition will take place from 7:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Friday, April 7, Northwest - Kansas City located at 6889 North Oak Trafficway, Gladstone, MO 64118. There is no entry fee and lunch will be provided.
The event provides students and entrepreneurs the opportunity to present ideas to professionals, small business owners and potential investors. It also gives students the chance to network with business professionals and gain presentation experience.
“The pitch competition brings together individuals from around the area to advance entrepreneurship. Many alumni and friends of Northwest volunteer their time to make the event possible,” said Dr. Ben Blackford, assistant director, Melvin D. and Valorie G. Booth School of Business. “During the competition, students gain real-world experience presenting to a variety of individuals with backgrounds similar to those who may someday be their colleagues, supervisors or customers,” said Larry Lee, Entrepreneurship instructor and organizer of the competition.
The Northwest Missouri State University New Venture Pitch Competition aims to bring together future or current entrepreneurs and small business owners to provide educational, informational, and networking opportunities.
Kevin Fullerton, founder of Springboard Creative in Mission Kansas will be our Kick-Off Speaker.  Prizes for the winning teams include funding and services to assist in the pursuit of their new venture. Total purse of cash and in-kind is $80,000.

Now accepting entries through Friday, March 3
 
For additional information please contact:
Larry LeeMelvin D. and Valorie G. Booth School of BusinessColden HallPhone: 816.752.8052Email: llee@nwmissouri.eduGuidelinesView printable version and scoring guide 
I. Eligibility
The competition is open to two types of entries.
The first type is all students currently enrolled in an accredited higher education institution, regardless of class status. All members of teams entering the competition must be students at an accredited institution. The venture being presented in the pitch developed by the team is only eligible to enter the competition once and must not be attached to a business currently in operation.
The second type is current high school students. All members of the team must be currently enrolled in a recognized school. Teams must include at least two members and no more than five members. The venture being presented in the pitch developed by the team is only eligible to enter the competition once and must not be attached to a business currently in operation.

II. Entry
A team may enter by completing the registration form and emailing a short summary of their business idea. llee@nwmissouri.edu Entries will be accepted until March 3, 2017. All teams that enter do so with the understanding that they will compete in the first round on April 7, 2017. Space will be limited and applying but not competing prevents another team from having the opportunity to participate in the competition. There is no entry fee for the competition.

III. Decisions and Changes to Rules
While no changes are expected, the committee overseeing the competition reserves the right to alter or clarify rules at its discretion. Every attempt will be made to comply with the published rules at all times. All decisions of the committee and judges are final.

IV. Confidentiality
Every effort will be made to limit exposure of ideas presented during the competition, although this cannot be guaranteed. In addition, the competition is open to the public and thus teams should not assume any amount of confidentiality. Judges, staff, other competitors, and others in attendance will not be asked to sign confidentiality agreements. Teams will not be penalized for declining to answer a question if the answer is deemed to potentially lead to disclosure of key intellectual property.

V. Waivers and Releases
The views expressed by the judges, competition committee, and all those associated with the competition are their own and do not represent those of Northwest Missouri State University. Everyone associated with this competition is volunteering his or her time and are under no obligation to provide advice or services to the contestants. Contestants release all involved in the competition from any responsibility or liability arising from decisions, feedback, or advice rendered before, during, or after this competition.

VI. Competition Format
The competition will consist of three rounds of competition. The initial presentations will be one minute elevator pitches. Fifteen seconds will be allowed for transition between teams. Following the elevator pitch round, all participating teams will exhibit displays that explain their venture.
Judges will tour the exhibits and meet with the teams that most impressed them during the elevator pitches. Following the exhibit round, the judges will meet to select the four finalists. The four teams selected for the final round will present again and the judges will select an overall winner for each track. During the final round, teams will have 10 minutes to present their business followed by 10 minutes of Q&A. Teams should be prepared for this format and structure their presentations accordingly in order to communicate the most important portions of their pitch to the judges. The schedule for the competition will be made available following the submission deadline.

VII. Evaluation Criteria
Teams will be judged on the effectiveness and persuasiveness of the presentations, the innovativeness of the ideas, the quality of the ideas, the competitive advantage of the proposed businesses, effective discussion of financials, and the proposed management team. While all of these criteria will impact who advances and ultimately wins the competition, the final decision will be based on the investment potential. Presentations cannot contain fabricated information including (but not limited to) stage of product development, experience of members involved, or market research. Student teams will be evaluated using the same criteria, but within the context of this is a learning experience to help them improve and with a special focus on innovative ventures.
Judges will use the scorecard included at the end of the guidelines to evaluate each presentation.

VIII. Disclosure Statement
Presentations do not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, any securities of these Corporations, companies or sole proprietorships. Such an offer or solicitation, if and when made, will be made only through an offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and applicable state securities regulatory authorities) or under an available exemption from such registration.Event and PrizesThe Northwest Missouri State University 2017 New Venture Pitch Competition aims to bring together future or current entrepreneurs and small business owners to provide educational, informational, and networking opportunities.

Review of Technical Exhibits




Members of the AAPM Technical Exhibits Subcommittee will be on hand to advise Exhibitors of any rule violations during the initial stages of booth setup. During the setup process, an informal review of the exhibits will take place. Written notice will be given to any company in violation of the AAPM Booth Design Rules and Regulations during the set up period so that Exhibitors will be given ample opportunity to correct any violations. All infringements must be corrected prior to the show opening at 12:30 pm on Sunday, July 31. If the infringement has not been corrected by that time, the following penalty will apply:
Penalty Rule for Booth Design/Setup Violations:

Minor Violation: Verbal and written warning.
Major Violation: Exhibitor will be responsible for payment equivalent to 25% of total booth fee and a loss of 10 placement points.
Second Time offenders:  Exhibitor will be responsible for payment equivalent to 50% of total booth fee and a loss of 20 placement points.

Any Exhibitor showing a potential violation during setup will be adequately warned by Exhibit Management if at all possible to allow correction before final inspection.
Final judgment of violations will occur during final inspection and will be at the sole discretion of Exhibit Management 




Exhibit Hall Lighting Check




The lighting in the Exhibit Halls will be turned up to full capacity on Saturday, July 30 (1:00 pm - 4:00 pm) to allow Exhibitors the opportunity to make booth adjustments. Please inform the necessary personnel. 




Exhibit Design




The regulations listed herein are presented to create and maintain an open atmosphere on the exhibit floor. To this end, 100 percent occupancy of allowed exhibit space is discouraged. In designing exhibits, good judgment and consideration for neighboring exhibitors and attendees should be primary objectives. 




Booth Construction & Arrangement




Exhibits will be so arranged as not to obstruct the general view, nor hide the exhibits of others. Plans for specialty-built displays not in accordance with regulations are to be submitted to Exhibit Management before construction is ordered.
 Non-Island booth regular and specially-built back walls, including signs, may not exceed an overall height of 8 feet. The maximum booth height of 8 feet may extend 1/2 the depth of the booth from the back wall. Height limitation of the display in the balance of the area is 4 feet, except for products or equipment, which in itself exceeds 4 feet.
No display material exposing an unfinished surface to neighboring booths will be permitted.  Exhibitors are responsible for carpeting their assigned booth space. 




Connection of Islands Across Official Aisle Space




If an Exhibitor wishes to connect one island formation with a second island formation across an official designated aisle, be it with a sign or archway, the Exhibitor will be responsible for the rental of the entire aisle space that runs the length of each booth. The price of the aisle space is $3,000 per 10 feet x 10 feet space.
 Example: 
              If two 20 feet x 30 feet booths are rented by one Exhibitor and said Exhibitor wishes to connect the two booths across an official aisle, and that aisle space measures 10 feet x 30 feet in space, the Exhibitor will be responsible for the rental of the entire 10 feet x 30 feet aisle space. ($3,000 x 300 sq. ft. = $9,000)

Use of Lighting Truss




Overhead lighting systems, attached to the facility steel structure, are permitted ONLY if the exhibit exceeds 400 square feet. Exhibitors wishing to hang lighting systems will be required to submit a Lighting Truss Diagram to AAPM along with the Booth Design form by May 13. All requests must be reviewed and approved by AAPM. Exhibit elements are not to be attached to the lighting truss. 
Exhibits built in non-compliance of the AAPM regulations are subject to a fine up to 25% of total booth space cost and loss of 10 booth placement points.
Lighting instruments, regardless of the type, must be positioned inside the perimeter boundaries of the purchased floor space. Projecting light beams or images outside the perimeter boundary of the booth (including external aisles) is prohibited. Special effects (spinning, rotating, and pulsating) must not interfere with other exhibits or detract from the professional atmosphere of the exhibition.




Request to Blackout Overhead Lights




Overhead hall lights may be requested to be shut off to those exhibitors with island formations measuring 900 square feet or greater. Make your request by using the Booth Design Form found in the AAPM Exhibitor Service Kit. Lights may only be turned off when directly overhead and in the confines of your booth. No light will be turned off if located outside the confines of your booth or too close to an aisle. AAPM has the final decision on which building lights will remain operational. The exhibitor will be responsible for all costs associated with this request. To request a lighting grid showing the placement and the number of lights located over your booth, an exhibiting company or appointed EAC can contact the official utility provider as listed in the AAPM Exhibitor Service Kit.




Submission of Scale Drawing for Island Formations




Exhibitors reserving island space are required to submit for approval complete scale drawings, both concept and construction, indicating all dimensions including applicable set back, to AAPM HQ by May 13. Exhibitors will be assigned the size of island space as requested on their Exhibitor Application and Contract. Therefore, prior to the submission of the Application, it is the responsibility of the Exhibitor to make sure the space requested will accommodate a booth design that conforms to the AAPM Booth Design Rules and Regulations pertaining to island booths.
If the scale drawing submitted on May 13 does not comply with the AAPM Booth Design Rules and Regulations, the Exhibitor must either redesign the booth to come into compliance or request a larger space. There is no guarantee that larger space will be available at that time.
Scale Drawing Requirements:

Both aerial and side views of booth designs must be provided.
Mandatory 1 foot setback must be labeled on each drawing.
Island exhibits may not exceed 24 feet in height from the floor to the top of any exhibit structure. This includes, but is not limited to, hanging signs. Any exhibit structure or display exceeding sixteen (16) feet in height must be approved by a licensed structural engineer prior to installation. A copy of the engineer's certificate or stamped floor plans must be submitted for approval.
Must identify equipment pieces and booth structure.
Must indicate booth structure construction material (i.e. cloth, hard wall, glass, metal mesh, etc.)
Canopy or covered areas must be identified and construction material must be disclosed.
Canopy or covered areas that are structurally supported from the floor or  hanging from ceiling  may extend to edge of booth.
Canopy or covered areas with signage or graphics MUST  be setback 5 feet from edge of booth.
Bottom of canopy or covered area must be at least 8 feet from the floor of the booth.
Once approved, if booth design changes, must resubmit for approval prior to set up.

Email or fax documents to: rachel@aapm.org / (571) 298-1301




Submission of Scale Drawing for Hanging Signs or Graphics




All exhibitors requesting to hang signs or graphics are required to submit detailed floorplans to AAPM Show Management no later than May 13.

Hanging signs and graphics will be permitted in the Exhibit Hall for booths 20' x 20' or larger. 
All hanging signs and graphics should be set back 5ft from the edge of the booth. 
All hanging signs and graphics must hang within the perimeters of the booth. 
AAPM Show Management must approve all hanging signs and graphics in advance.
If approved, we recommend all hanging signs and graphics be shipped in advance to the warehouse, but it is not required. 

              An order form with prices will be included in the Online Service Kit.
Email or fax documents to: rachel@aapm.org / (571) 298-1301




Issues Common to All Booth Types




Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
 All exhibiting companies are required to be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are encouraged to be sensitive, and as reasonably accommodating as possible, to attendees with disabilities. Information regarding ADA compliance is available from the U.S. Department of Justice ADA Information Line at +1(800-514-0301) or visit its Web site at: www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/infoline.htm.
Structural Integrity
All exhibit displays should be designed and erected in a manner that will withstand normal contact or vibration caused by neighboring exhibitors, hall laborers or installation/dismantling equipment such as fork lifts. Displays should also be able to withstand moderate wind effects that may occur in the exhibit hall when freight doors are open. Refer to local building codes that regulate temporary structures.
Exhibitors should ensure that any display fixtures such as tables, racks or shelves are designed and installed properly to support the product or marketing materials to be displayed upon them.
Flammable and Toxic Materials
All materials used in display construction or decorating should be made of fire retardant materials and be certified as flame retardant. Samples should also be available for testing. Materials that cannot be treated to meet the requirements should not be used. A flame proofing certificate should be available for inspection.
Exhibitors should dispose of any waste products they generate during the exhibition in accordance with guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency and the facility.
Electrical
 Every exhibit facility has different electrical requirements; however, minimum guidelines are suggested:

All 110-volt wiring should be grounded three-wire.
Wiring that touches the floor should be "SO" cord (minimum 14-gauge/three-wire) flat cord, which is insulated to qualify for "extra hard usage".
Cord wiring above floor level can be "SJ" which is rated for "hard usage".
Using zip cords, two-wire cords, latex cords, plastic cord, lamp cord, open clip sockets, and two-wire clamp-on fixtures is not recommended and is often prohibited. Cube taps are not recommended and are often prohibited.
Power strips (multi-plug connectors) should be UL approved, with built-in over-load protectors.

Storage
 Fire regulations in most exhibit facilities prohibit storing product, literature, empty packing containers or packing materials behind back drapes or under draped tables. In most cases, however, exhibitors may store a limited supply of literature or product appropriately within the booth area, so long as these items do not impede access to utility services, create a safety problem or look unsightly.
Demonstrations
 As a matter of safety and courtesy to others, exhibitors should conduct sales presentations and product demonstrations in a manner which assures all exhibitor personnel and attendees are within the contracted exhibit space and not encroaching on the aisle or neighboring exhibits. It is the responsibility of each exhibitor to arrange displays, product presentation, and demonstration areas to ensure compliance. No activities should be planned or products displayed in a manner that would require an audience to gather in the aisles. Show Management reserves the right to determine if a demonstration interferes with adjacent exhibit spaces and when it must be discontinued.
Special caution should be taken when demonstrating machinery or equipment that has moving parts, or any product that is otherwise potentially dangerous. Exhibitors should establish a minimum setback of three feet (3') and/or install hazard barriers as necessary to prevent accidental injury to spectators. Sound demonstrations should not exceed 85 decibels. Additionally, demonstrations should only be conducted by qualified personnel.
Sound/Music
 In general, exhibitors may use sound equipment in their booths so long as the noise level does not disrupt the activities of neighboring exhibitors. Speakers and other sound devices should be positioned so as to direct sound into the booth rather than into the aisle. Rule of thumb: Sound and noise should not exceed 85 decibels.
Exhibitors should be aware that music played in their booths, whether live or recorded, may be subject to laws governing the use of copyrighted compositions. ASCAP, BMI and SESAC are three authorized licensing organizations that collect copyright fees on behalf of composers and publishers of music.

ÂVentria is leading the way in developing innovative technologies that enable the production of a broad number of human health products and I am excited to be a part of this innovative company. Â
