Filtration technology for a sustainable future







 


Why settle for plastic?

Introducing:
Ceramic Picofiltration
The Cerahelix PicoHelix filter is made out of renewable ceramic material and is used to make products from biomass, to re-use and recycle resources, and to purify water. The combination of high purity with high durability helps the PicoHelix reduce energy use by more than 90% compared to thermal separation methods. Combined, these features make ceramic picofiltration a leading separation technology for the emerging circular economy. The PicoHelix high purity is achieved by using DNA to form the really small pores in the membrane. Cerahelix is committed to delivering high performing filter products to help our customers meet their sustainability goals.
Interested in the PicoHelix™? Contact us today.

Company








Cerahelix designs and manufactures ceramic picofiltration products used for high purity filtration. Our filters meet our customers needs for energy and water conservation and they improve process efficiency for a wide range of industries.

History
Cerahelix was founded in 2011. That same year we were selected as a finalist in the MassChallenge accelerator. We have been awarded $2.5 million in federal SBIR grants from both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to take our technology from proof of concept to working full scale prototype.

Cerahelix has raised $2.9 million in seed stage Angel investment to support early sales of filter elements to prospective customers in each of our key market segments.

Intern Profile: Brandon Smith

		
		
			Posted on July 27, 2015 by Jon Duke


 
			
 
			Tweet




When I started looking for internships, I wanted to find something at a start-up that would allow me to use my technical background in chemistry and engineering.  I was ecstatic when I was given the opportunity to work at Cerahelix through the Maine Venture Fund (MVF) summer internship, and knew this opportunity would provide me with the wealth of experiences I was hoping to get from my summer position.
My responsibilities as a summer intern are split between the MVF and two of the fund’s portfolio companies, including Cerahelix.  Cerahelix is building a ceramic membrane that performs molecular filtration for produced water  and other  applications under extreme conditions. My prior education as a PhD chemist and experience as an R&D Engineer have helped me come up to speed quickly on the technology behind the product being developed, allowing me to dive into the business development and marketing opportunities they would like me to address.
At Cerahelix, I am helping the company prioritize their market opportunities and am performing a competitive and cost analysis on those key markets.  It has been a great experience to translate the business theory of the classroom that I learned during my first year at Tuck into tangible solutions that have a meaningful impact on the success of a start-up company. It is a unique professional and educational experience to interact with the team of a start-up company, and I doubt that I could have found such meaningful experiences like I am getting at Cerahelix in another internship.
 
 
Brandon is currently an MBA student at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, and holds a PhD in Chemistry from Dartmouth College and a BA from Willamette University.

PicoHelix™ Products



PicoHelix ceramic membrane products employ a patented DNA template process to form nano-sized pores used for filtration. Our DNA technology provides control over the pore size. This results in filter products that range from loose nanofiltration (<2000 Daltons) down to high purity picofiltration (<500 Daltons).


 




 Commercial Products


Filter Element Sizes:
Cerahelix filter products are currently available in two sizes:

Single channel elements for lab scale and small pilot scale studies
Multi-channel elements for commercial scale projects

Filter Versions:


Cerahelix filters can be made with different size cutoffs. The current versions are shown below: 



PicofiltrationMW Cutoff <500 Da


Tight NanofiltrationMW Cutoff <1000 Da


Loose NanofiltrationMW Cutoff <2000 Da


Single Channel6 mm ID,10 cm to 1m length


Multi Channel3.3 mm ID,19 channels, 1m length
3.3 mm ID, 85 channels, 1m length (available late 2017)




Interested in a product datasheet? Contact Us


 



Filter Element Housings:
Cerahelix housings are designed for individual and multi-element configurations. Our standard housings are made from 316 stainless steel.  We also offer custom housings for industry specific processes including solvent filtration applications.


 

Laboratory Test Systems
Cerahelix sells and leases bench-top cross flow filtration systems for small scale research and development testing needs. The system’s innovative housing design  provides a flexible approach to scalability by allowing an increase in membrane surface area from 0.01 m2 to 0.40 m2 without sacrificing optimum cross flow velocities or increasing flow rate requirements. This provides a 40X increase in filter surface area that can be tested using the same test stand.











Tank Volume3.5 L


Feed Flow Rate11 Liters/minute


Pump1HP with a speed controller


Filter Elements1-6 in series


Membrane Surface area0.01 m2 to 0.40 m2

Cerahelix’s New Look
On December 5, 2013by Brian RahillTweet  

Cerahelix Inc.‘s revolutionary technology, the helix NFM, uses DNA to make incredibly small, uniform holes in ceramics, creating a filter for liquids that is chemical resistant, resists fouling, and creates liquids of high purity.
The helix NFM can have a significant impact on the sustainability of the earth: according to CEO Susan MacKay, replacing a commercial evaporator with Cerahelix filtration tubes in an industrial setting where they’re trying to remove 6,000 gallons of water a day could save 1,200 tons of carbon per year–equivalent to about 400 acres of forest.
What does that have to do with us? Cerahelix sought out RainStorm to help bring this message to the world.
The new Cerahelix website is built using the WordPress content management system. It sports informative videos explaining the patented technology, as well as information on their product and investors and an exciting news page. Additionally, the website is adaptable to fit screens of any size, so the site can be viewed easily on mobile devices without losing its color and vibrancy.
We’re proud to have worked with Cerahelix in designing their new website, and we encourage you to check it out today at www.cerahelix.com!

Filtration technology for a sustainable future







 


Why settle for plastic?

Introducing:
Ceramic Picofiltration
The Cerahelix PicoHelix filter is made out of renewable ceramic material and is used to make products from biomass, to re-use and recycle resources, and to purify water. The combination of high purity with high durability helps the PicoHelix reduce energy use by more than 90% compared to thermal separation methods. Combined, these features make ceramic picofiltration a leading separation technology for the emerging circular economy. The PicoHelix high purity is achieved by using DNA to form the really small pores in the membrane. Cerahelix is committed to delivering high performing filter products to help our customers meet their sustainability goals.
