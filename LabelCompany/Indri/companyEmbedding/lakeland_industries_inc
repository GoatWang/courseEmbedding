About Lakeland Industries, Safety Clothing






About Lakeland

Mission Statement
Our mission is to create and manufacture a wide variety of technologically advanced protective clothing that saves lives and protects workers both in private and public employment from fire, hazardous chemicals and diseases  throughout the world.Among leading companies designing and manufacturing protective garments for industry, municipalities, and the burgeoning healthcare field, Lakeland Industries' products have established and maintained their global reputation for overall quality. Indeed, our products have long been recognized as the field's gold standard for quality - that essential, expected and deserved constituent of any protective wear.   
Quality is Factor Number One
Before quality comes quality assurance. Lakeland has an ISO 9001: 2008 Certified Quality Management System, in addition to meeting ANSI to 101-1996 requirements. This latest enhancement of Lakeland's global reputation for overall product quality -- long recognized as the field's gold standard -- is additional assurance of superior product performance. Quality is the first factor considered by our designers in the product development process, the first tested by our technical staff, and the first attribute sought by the users of our products worldwide. Lakeland quality is the primary reason why workers wearing our garments put them on with confidence and wear them with peace of mind. Companies that supply their employees Lakeland products show they care. These companies, our valued customers, are experiencing less absenteeism due to injury, lower insurance rates and increased production. 
Multiple Product Lines to Meet Your Needs
Lakeland manufactures a broad array of industrial protective clothing. The lineup includes limited-use and disposable clothing, chemical protective clothing, flame resistant clothing, woven and anti-static clothing, aluminized industrial heat protective clothing and hand and arm protective products. 
We're Saving by Growing
Lakeland is reaching out to world markets with its broadening array of protective products, and producing them at international sites as well as domestic ones. We became slightly Canadian with the establishment of Lakeland Protective Wear Inc. in Burlington, Ontario. A year later we opened a new factory in Celaya Mexico, a move that augmented our manufacturing network and tripled our production capacity. Recently, we entered China, again increasing our production while lowering costs. At home, we've picked up speed, too. Lakeland has added 36,000 sq., ft. to its Decatur, Alabama facility enabling us to store more raw materials and finished goods. This cut our response time on orders. Customers demand quick delivery and they're showing it with repeat and increased orders. 
Placing Your Order Gets Easier and Faster
You can place your order through e-mail at order@lakeland.com or orders@lakeland.com.  You may also send your order by fax to 256-350-0773.  Lakeland is in the process of installing new computer software that will streamline orders and shipments.  In the near future, you will be able to place orders through EDI.
Up-to-Date Information on the Web
For late breaking product or pricing information, visit our website at www.lakeland.com. Besides seeing the latest Lakeland products, you can email us for technical support. Customer Service is just a mouse click away!
Reliable Protective Wear Across Three Generations
Lakeland Industries Inc. is a multidivisional, publicly held producer of quality, high performance protective garments for industry in both domestic and worldwide markets.  Headquartered in Ronkonkoma, New York since 1982, its more than $95.7 million in sales last year is hard evidence of growth and recognition, factors attributable directly to its ongoing research and development programs.  Lakeland's protective clothing products are proven on the job every day, and are specified routinely for workers in the chemical, petrochemical, healthcare, automotive, glass, cement and other industries in which hazardous materials must be handled. These reliable and, therefore, popular lines are widely diversified, yet stand prominently on the common foundation of quality for which the Company is well-known and respected, and to which it continues to pledge its efforts.  Lakeland is proven around the world. Prove it to yourself. Call us today at 1-800-645-9291. Give your people, and your company, the assurance of our Protective Clothing Products.

About Lakeland Industries, Safety Clothing






About Lakeland

Mission Statement
Our mission is to create and manufacture a wide variety of technologically advanced protective clothing that saves lives and protects workers both in private and public employment from fire, hazardous chemicals and diseases  throughout the world.Among leading companies designing and manufacturing protective garments for industry, municipalities, and the burgeoning healthcare field, Lakeland Industries' products have established and maintained their global reputation for overall quality. Indeed, our products have long been recognized as the field's gold standard for quality - that essential, expected and deserved constituent of any protective wear.   
Quality is Factor Number One
Before quality comes quality assurance. Lakeland has an ISO 9001: 2008 Certified Quality Management System, in addition to meeting ANSI to 101-1996 requirements. This latest enhancement of Lakeland's global reputation for overall product quality -- long recognized as the field's gold standard -- is additional assurance of superior product performance. Quality is the first factor considered by our designers in the product development process, the first tested by our technical staff, and the first attribute sought by the users of our products worldwide. Lakeland quality is the primary reason why workers wearing our garments put them on with confidence and wear them with peace of mind. Companies that supply their employees Lakeland products show they care. These companies, our valued customers, are experiencing less absenteeism due to injury, lower insurance rates and increased production. 
Multiple Product Lines to Meet Your Needs
Lakeland manufactures a broad array of industrial protective clothing. The lineup includes limited-use and disposable clothing, chemical protective clothing, flame resistant clothing, woven and anti-static clothing, aluminized industrial heat protective clothing and hand and arm protective products. 
We're Saving by Growing
Lakeland is reaching out to world markets with its broadening array of protective products, and producing them at international sites as well as domestic ones. We became slightly Canadian with the establishment of Lakeland Protective Wear Inc. in Burlington, Ontario. A year later we opened a new factory in Celaya Mexico, a move that augmented our manufacturing network and tripled our production capacity. Recently, we entered China, again increasing our production while lowering costs. At home, we've picked up speed, too. Lakeland has added 36,000 sq., ft. to its Decatur, Alabama facility enabling us to store more raw materials and finished goods. This cut our response time on orders. Customers demand quick delivery and they're showing it with repeat and increased orders. 
Placing Your Order Gets Easier and Faster
You can place your order through e-mail at order@lakeland.com or orders@lakeland.com.  You may also send your order by fax to 256-350-0773.  Lakeland is in the process of installing new computer software that will streamline orders and shipments.  In the near future, you will be able to place orders through EDI.
Up-to-Date Information on the Web
For late breaking product or pricing information, visit our website at www.lakeland.com. Besides seeing the latest Lakeland products, you can email us for technical support. Customer Service is just a mouse click away!
Reliable Protective Wear Across Three Generations
Lakeland Industries Inc. is a multidivisional, publicly held producer of quality, high performance protective garments for industry in both domestic and worldwide markets.  Headquartered in Ronkonkoma, New York since 1982, its more than $95.7 million in sales last year is hard evidence of growth and recognition, factors attributable directly to its ongoing research and development programs.  Lakeland's protective clothing products are proven on the job every day, and are specified routinely for workers in the chemical, petrochemical, healthcare, automotive, glass, cement and other industries in which hazardous materials must be handled. These reliable and, therefore, popular lines are widely diversified, yet stand prominently on the common foundation of quality for which the Company is well-known and respected, and to which it continues to pledge its efforts.  Lakeland is proven around the world. Prove it to yourself. Call us today at 1-800-645-9291. Give your people, and your company, the assurance of our Protective Clothing Products.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
