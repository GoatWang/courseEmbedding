We do not believe that is usually necessary because it costs $75 and it would be easier to just file the company to see if the name is available.

Prepare stock certificates for one or more stockholdersOrdering our attorney-developed shareholder agreement will help keep the stock from being transferred to unwanted third parties. This is recommended for all corporations with more than one stockholder.    What is a Corporation, and what does Incorporating mean?A Corporation is a legal entity or legal “person” that exists completely separate from natural persons, and is typically composed of natural persons that hold stock in the corporation.Incorporating is the act of filing a new corporation.When incorporating, you have the ability to select the state of incorporation, which is the state where the initial paperwork is filed and the state that will govern the internal affairs of your business (relationship between decision makers and owners).Delaware General Corporation Law will protect your corporation only if you select to incorporate in the State of Delaware.Delaware has the most desirable legislature, statutes, case law and court system for corporate governance. Starting in Delaware is an easy choice that some business owners overlook in the haste to get started, but may regret later. Rarely is the state in which you reside as favorable as where the owners reside. After comparing all 50 states, business owners frequently decide to incorporate in Delaware.    Why Should I Incorporate in Delaware?Delaware has a reputation as the forerunner in corporate law in the United States. Industry leading companies, from credit cards (Discover, Bank of America) to technology (Google, Apple) to restaurants (McDonald’s, Chipotle) are incorporated in Delaware. So why should you join them and incorporate your business in Delaware?1. Delaware has the strongest Corporate Shield of any StateThe main reason to incorporate in Delaware is to protect personal assets from your business’s liability. This protection is referred to as the “corporate veil” or “shield”, and is especially strong in Delaware.2. Business-Friendly Government Services Many of the businesses that chose to organize in Delaware have done so because of the business-friendly government in Delaware. Delaware’s Court of Chancery is a specialized business court. With its established body of case law, the Delaware courts are experts at resolving business conflicts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has ranked Delaware’s litigation system the best in the country for fairness every year.3. Ability to Operate a Delaware Corporation in every State or almost any CountryWith a Delaware corporation, you have the ability to conduct business in every state and almost every country. Delaware corporations do not need a bank account or business address in Delaware, they need only a Registered Agent to forward Delaware annual notices and legal notices.4. Predictability in Ownership and Management StructureDelaware’s predictable laws on ownership and management allow you to structure your business with confidence. You can even have the protection of a corporation for a one-person business. For example, one individual can be sole Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the sole shareholder.5. Directors and Officers are protected from lawsuitsBusiness officers and Directors have the ability to take risks and make routine business decisions without fear of having those decisions second guessed by stockholders. Even if losses result, as long as the decisions were not self-dealing, the officers and directors should be protected from personal liability.6. No Delaware income tax returns  for Corporations operating outside of DelawareDelaware corporations do not have to file Delaware tax returns if they do not conduct business in Delaware.7. Tax AdvantagesA corporation is taxed as a C-Corporation unless it elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation. If the stockholders are eligible and timely elect to be taxed as an S-Corporation with the IRS, it can save the stockholders thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes by splitting income 50/50 between self-employment income and an “S-Dividend”.8. Delaware offers speedy document approval and filings The Secretary of State’s office in Delaware maintains extended hours for filing and can approve documents in as little as one hour for additional fees.9. A Delaware Corporation can be used to manage almost anythingCorporations can range from a one personal consulting company to a multi-million dollar technology business. Corporations are not recommended for holding passive assets, like real estate.10. Delaware has the fairest courts and laws of any stateThe United States Chamber of Commerce has recognized Delaware’s business dispute and incorporation climate by ranking Delaware’s litigation system #1 over the past 9 years. The advantage of having so many business disputes resolved in Delaware is that previous conflicts have established an extensive body of case law.    How to Start a Delaware Corporation1. Choose a NameChoose a unique corporate name that is not registered with the Delaware Secretary of State. The name must include a corporate ending or abbreviation thereof (ex. “Inc.”, “Incorporated”, “Company”, “Co..”, “Corporation”, “Corp.”, “Association”, etc.) You can always file a name amendment in the future. For example, when we incorporated “Pinterest,” the original name was “Cold Brew Labs.”2. Find a Registered AgentEvery Delaware corporation is required to have a registered agent in Delaware. The registered agent will forward lawsuits and correspondence from the Delaware Secretary of State to you.You do not need to visit or have an office or any other connection to Delaware to incorporate a corporation in Delaware. Select Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) to act as your registered agent.3. Draft a Certificate of IncorporationThe Certificate of Incorporation officially brings the corporation into existence in the public record. IncNow will prepare a Certificate of Incorporation that includes:Name of the corporationName and address of the Registered Agent of the corporationStatement of the type of business that the corporation will engage inNumber of shares of authorized stock that the corporation will issuePar value of each shareName and signature of the incorporatorIndemnification clause for breaches of Duty of CareAllowance for Director Amended BylawsThe standard form from the Secretary of State leaves off recommended provisions, such as the director amended bylaws and relaxed director liability. These provisions must be included in the Certificate of Incorporation and cannot be enforced if included only in the bylaws or elsewhere.4. Annual Taxes and FeesSimilar to most states, Delaware corporations pay a “franchise tax”, or annual fee. This fee is based either on the shares authorized by the corporation on its Certificate of Incorporation, or any Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that change the number of shares of stock the corporation is allowed to issue.We recommend incorporating with 1500 shares of voting stock to minimize both filing and annual fees. If additional shares of restricted or non-voting stock are desired or required in the future, the authorized number of shares can be amended.5. Stockholder AgreementIf your corporation has more than one stockholder, it should have a Stockholder Agreement.Stockholder agreements are optional, but recommended.They set out the powers and rights of stockholders, as well as their relationship with the corporation and must be executed by all stockholders.A stockholder agreement can place restrictions on transferring stock.Delaware law specifically allows certain restrictions on the rights of stockholders to sell their shares.In closely held corporations with very few stockholders, these agreements are especially important because they will govern the relationship between the stockholders.Notice of the stockholder agreement must also be on the stock certificates to provide notice to possible assignees of the restrictions.Any corporation with more than one stockholder should have a Stockholder Agreement to minimize future problems of valuation, buyback, and unwanted third parties owning stock as transfers or assignees.6. Stockholder Agreement ServiceTo the surprise of many business owners, bylaws do not include provisions for rights of first refusal or buy-out provisions for stockholders. Corporation stockholders should consider a Stockholder Agreement — an important additional service to protect their stockholders’ expectations.We offer a standard Delaware Stockholder Agreement for $199.A Delaware attorney developed this Stockholder Agreement in the course of practice.It has been modified for our customers to provide extra rights and protection for stockholders to prevent outsiders from becoming unwanted stockholders in their company in the event of a sale of stock or death of a shareholder.This document gives you a running start to future planning for your Corporation.    C-Corporations vs. S-CorporationsThe “C” vs. “S” discussion should not impact your pre-incorporation decision. While corporations are C-Corporations by default when they are incorporated, it is very easy to change classifications between C-Corporations and S-Corporations.There is no distinction between the Certificate of Incorporation for a C-Corporation and that for an S-Corporation. Every Corporation filed with any of the 50 US States starts out simply as a general Corporation.    ConclusionDelaware’s pro-business climate, makes it the location of choice for anyone seeking to incorporate their business. Whether large or small, your business can reap the benefits of incorporating in Delaware.

With years of experience, the incorporation specialists at IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) can assist you with any questions you may have about forming a limited liability company in Delaware. IncNow can help you understand topics such as the common provisions included in Operating Agreements and Certificates of Formation.As a Delaware Commercial Registered Agent, IncNow has a higher filing priority than agents outside of Delaware and self-filers, which means your documents are normally returned to you in 1-3 days, not weeks.    How do you form a Delaware LLC?Choose a Delaware LLC NameRegistering a Delaware LLC requires 2 things:Filing a Certificate of FormationDocumenting your Operating AgreementBefore filing the Certificate of Formation, you must first check the prospective business name with the Delaware Secretary of State for conflicts, which can be done online at Incnow.com.Additionally, Delaware law requires that all new LLCs have either “Limited Liability Company”, “LLC”, or “L.L.C.” in the company name. If, at a later date, you want to change your LLC name, you can do so through an Amendment to the Certificate of Formation.Delaware Registered Agent RequirementYou can form an LLC in Delaware without visiting, opening an office, or maintaining a bank account in Delaware; however, the Delaware LLC Act requires any company incorporated in Delaware to have a Delaware Registered Agent with an in-state street address. Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) will act as Registered Agent for companies incorporating in Delaware for a small annual fee.After formation, the Registered Agent receives State of Delaware notices and is required to be generally available during business hours to accept and forward court notices to you (service of process). The Registered Agent will be there for the life of your company, so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable. Agents and Corporations (IncNow) has been a Delaware Registered Agent since 1974, and at the same office since 1982. IncNow is family operated by Delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate law.Delaware Certificate of Formation RequirementsOur office will sign as the authorized person (also known as an organizer) and file a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State’s Division of Corporations to form the Delaware LLC on public record. Your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you. Other states refer to this document as Articles of Organization, but Delaware does not use that term.A Certificate of Formation must include:The name of the LLCThe name and address of the registered agentThe signature of an authorized individualOf special note, if the Delaware LLC is a Series LLC, which protects assets of parts of the LLC from the liabilities of other parts of the LLC, then this must be indicated on the Certificate of Formation (more information on the Series LLC may be found elsewhere on this site). Many optional provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Formation. Upon special request, we can include the names of members and/or managers on the Certificate of Formation.Delaware LLC Operating AgreementWith our complete package, we draft an Operating Agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures. Delaware requires that LLCs have an Operating Agreement that will govern it; however, Delaware does not require that the Operating Agreement be filed with the state, or even be in writing.It is recommended that you have a written, signed agreement. Even in a single-member Delaware LLC, the Operating Agreement is important because it provides a decision-making structure that will benefit the LLC when dealing with other entities, increase protection, and increase credibility for financial transactions. The Operating Agreement will include provisions such as liability, ownership, dissolution, and transfer of interest, among others.Many incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems. A well-crafted Delaware Operating Agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different direction.Signing the LLC Operating AgreementOnce the Delaware Operating Agreement has been drafted and approved, all members should execute it. Most Delaware LLCs, as a practical matter, will not draft and finalize the Operating Agreement until after formation. Many formal requirements of corporations, such as those related to voting and annual meetings, are not required by LLCs.  To this extent, many well-crafted Operating Agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operations.While an Operating Agreement can be enforceable unsigned, it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned Operating Agreement was agreed upon by all members. In multi-member LLCs, it is especially important to have a signed Operating Agreement. Should you change the agreement or ownership structure, an amended and restated LLC Operating Agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes.    Top 10 Reasons to Form an LLC in Delaware1. Delaware LLCs offer the most protection for you and your business with two-way protectionBy forming a Delaware LLC, you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities. This means that, if the business itself cannot pay a creditor, then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets, such as your house, car and other personal possessions.Delaware explicitly makes the “Charging Order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of LLC members. This prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company. Creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the LLC’s distributions to that member, not a control interest or a right to liquidate the LLC.2. Delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any stateDelaware governs the internal affairs of your company, including its liability shield. The corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the Delaware LLC Act, which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business, is thicker than any protection offered in any other state.3. Delaware LLCs can operate in almost any State or CountryYou can form a Delaware LLC no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the United States. Outside the United States, there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a Delaware LLC, and a Delaware LLC does not need to have a bank account or office in Delaware. A Registered Agent, such as IncNow, maintains a physical address in Delaware required to forward court and Delaware government notices to you.4. Delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businessWhen entering into a Delaware LLC, it is flexible in ownership and management structure. One individual can serve as both the owner and manager. An LLC is governed by its Operating Agreement, allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written. Since the LLC is a contractual entity, it is important that the Delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written. Furthermore, there is no required annual general meeting, and there is much less administrative paperwork in general, compared to a corporation.5. Managers are protected from lawsuitsThe LLC Agreement in Delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties. This allows business managers and controlling, managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors, provided such actions are not in bad faith. Even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced, business managers have the freedom to make business decisions, even if losses result without manager liability, provided the decisions are not self-dealing. Even self-dealing is not entirely prohibited; instead, self-dealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members.6. No Delaware income tax if your operations are in other states (and other business tax loopholes)There is no Delaware tax return to file for LLCs that are formed in Delaware, provided they conduct no business in Delaware.As with LLCs in other states, profits are taxed personally at the member level, but not at the LLC level. An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership, unless it elects S-Corporation or C-Corporation tax status.Having an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation can save thousands in self-employment taxes because your income can be split 50/50 between self-employment income and “S-Dividend” income. The S-Dividend can reduce your taxes by thousands. For example, splitting $200,000 of income would save the S-electing LLC member more than $4,000 in social security and Medicare taxes. Learn more about these advantages in our LLC tax tips section.7. Delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsThe Delaware Secretary of State’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour.8. You can use a Delaware LLC to own and manage almost anythingThe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multi-million dollar commercial properties. It may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets, like real estate or intellectual property.Most common uses include:To hold real property, such as personal or business real estateTo operate a service businessTo hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes, automobiles, boats and patents9. Delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks, not yearsDelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes, the Court of Chancery. Its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases, and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not. There are no jury trials in the Court of Chancery, so Court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the Court.The Delaware court system can act very quickly. Sometimes, the whole process, from start to finish (discovery and motions to trial decisions), can be over in two months. Written decisions from the Court of Chancery are the standard, and are often 100 pages long. This well-reasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes. Even appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court can be expedited. The Delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials.10. Delaware has the most pro-business laws of any US stateDelaware’s law is generally thought to be pro-business, and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses. Because of the maturity of Delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by Delaware’s judicial system, there is predictability in outcomes.This means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your LLC, there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome, which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate. Even when judges change, it is not a favoritism or political system. Judges in Delaware make reasoned, non-political decisions.

This is demonstrated by a US Chamber of Commerce study of state liability systems that has rated Delaware #1 in all eight studies it has conducted on all 50 states. A few examples of Delaware’s benefits include:Easy and ReliableDelaware law has been tested and provides predictability.Delaware regularly updates its laws to remain the leading state for incorporation.Delaware has a separate Court of Chancery that handles Corporation law cases quickly and competently.Lower CostsThe Delaware Corporation minimum annual franchise tax is $175 and the filing fee is $50.The Delaware LLC annual fee is $300, regardless of capitalization.Delaware does not tax intangible property such as leases or royalties (the “Delaware loophole”).ProtectionPiercing the corporate veil, or making individuals personally liable for claims against their business, is very unlikely in Delaware.Delaware explicitly makes the charging order the sole and exclusive remedy of creditors of LLC members, meaning that creditors of members can only receive distributions from the LLC, and not control foreclosure, or liquidation.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER TRANSFERING VENUE
JOHN R. TUNHEIM, District Judge.
The question before the Court is whether exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed in Minnesota, while the same parties are currently involved in litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia after a venue change, is proper. The Court ordered the parties to submit simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issues of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), compulsory counter claims, and the doctrine of abstention, as outlined in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 259 F.3d 949, 953 (8th Cir. 2001). Both parties have responded. For the reasons set forth below, the Court transfers venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
BACKGROUND
The defendants in this litigation (collectively, "Noteholders") were plaintiffs in an earlier action brought in the District of Minnesota against CompuCredit Holdings Corporation ("CompuCredit"), who is the plaintiff in this action. Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al. v. CompuCredit Holdings Corp., Case No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Dec. 21, 2009) (hereinafter, the "Georgia litigation"). In that litigation, CompuCredit moved for a transfer of venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), citing expense and the convenience of the parties. The Court granted the request for a change of venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
Within weeks of the transfer, CompuCredit filed suit in Minnesota alleging antitrust violations (the "Minnesota litigation"). (Docket No. 1.) The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are closely related to the issues in the Georgia litigation. For example, Noteholders' complaint in the Georgia litigation alleges that on December 3, 2009, CompuCredit announced a plan to give away $24 million and spin off a profitable subsidiary primarily to insiders. (Compl. ¶ 21-26, Docket No. 1). This announcement resulted in a dramatic drop in the trading prices of CompuCredit notes. After the drop in prices, CompuCredit initiated a tender offer for the notes at the lower prices. Noteholders boycotted this tender offer, which is a key fact in CompuCredit's antitrust claims in the Minnesota litigation. (Id.) Noteholders initiated the Georgia litigation to try to protect the value of their shares and were required to enter into settlement negotiations with CompuCredit, portions of which are now a part of the allegations of conspiracy in the Minnesota litigation. (Id. ¶78-79.)
DISCUSSION
"[A] district court should . . . consider[] abstaining from exercising jurisdiction in [a] case where a parallel . . . lawsuit is pending. Th[e] court may raise the issue of the appropriateness of abstention sua sponte." Cincinnati Indem. Co. v. A & K Const. Co., 542 F.3d 623, 624-25 (8th Cir. 2008) (discussing abstention in a case involving parallel federal and state claims) (internal citations omitted). Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly noted that federal courts should avoid duplicitous litigation ongoing in other federal courts, particularly when potentially compulsory counterclaims are involved. Nat'l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Fowler, 287 F.2d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 1961).
Further, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),1 the general transfer provision, provides: "For the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought." In analyzing a motion to transfer under § 1404(a), a district court employs a three-factor balancing test that considers "(1) the convenience of the parties, (2) the convenience of the witnesses, and (3) the interests of justice." Terra Int'l Inc. v. Miss. Chem. Corp., 119 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir. 1997). These factors are not exclusive, and a district court's decision on a motion to transfer "require[s] a case-by-case evaluation of the particular circumstances at hand and a consideration of all relevant factors." Id. Ultimately, a district court enjoys "much discretion" when deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer. Id. at 697. See also Cent. Reg'l Emps. Benefit Fund v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., No. 09-2125, 2010 WL 3515693, at *1 (D. Minn. Aug. 21, 2010).
In the instant case, the Court finds that the relevant factors to the decision to transfer venue are whether the issues raised in the Minnesota litigation could be considered compulsory counterclaims and whether the Colorado River doctrine of abstention is implicated.
I. Venue Considerations
In the Georgia litigation, the Court found that venue transfer was warranted primarily for the expense and convenience of the parties. Regarding the first factor of the balancing test, the Court noted that all of the parties are corporations, more than two-thirds of whom have no ties to Minnesota at all. Hr'g on Mot. to Change Venue at 34:19-20 (Docket No. 81), Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al., No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Mar. 19, 2010). Further, Noteholders claimed CompuCredit was insolvent, so the Court found that none of the parties would be served by the increased expense of litigating in Minnesota as opposed to Georgia, where CompuCredit is located. Id. at 34:15-20. Regarding the second factor, the Court also noted that the primary witnesses in the case were located in Georgia and that no fact witnesses were located in Minnesota. Id. at 35:18-36:6.
Finally, on the third factor, the Court noted the considerations for evaluating the interests of justice are "the relative familiarity of the two courts with the law to be applied, the relative ability of the parties to bear the expenses of litigating in a distant forum, judicial economy, the plaintiff's choice of forum, obstacles to a fair trial, and each party's ability to enforce a judgment." Id. at 36:7-17 (citing Graff v. Qwest Commc'ns Corp., 33 F.Supp.2d 1117, 1122 (D. Minn. 1999)). The Court determined the last consideration was not relevant and the others either carried no weight or were equally balanced, with the exception of the ability to bear the costs of the litigation. Id. at 36:18-39:4. Again, the Court cited CompuCredit's potential insolvency as determinative on this point. Id.
The Court finds that the earlier determination on these three factors is applicable to the instant litigation since the parties are the same and the issues to be litigated revolve around the same factual scenarios. The Court notes that the instant litigation presents further issues related to judicial economy and the interests of justice that support a transfer of venue that were not present in the Georgia litigation: the potential of compulsory counterclaims and Colorado River concerns of duplicative litigation.
II. Compulsory Counterclaims
While a claim that could be a compulsory counterclaim in a different litigation does not necessarily make venue improper, courts have noted that when "[t]here undoubtedly are judicial economy and preclusion issues involved . . . the availability of a counterclaim in [another court] is a factor to consider in determining whether to transfer the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)." Jomico, LLC v. Traxys N. Am., LLC, No. 09-342, 2010 WL 2640100, at *4 (E.D. Okla. June 29, 2010) (emphasis omitted). Without determining precisely if claims were compulsory counterclaims, other courts have transferred cases to districts with pending litigation in part because "[e]ven if the cases are not ultimately consolidated, having the matters resolved in the same forum will increase the probability of consistent results." Neb. Beef, Ltd. v. Advanced Food Co., Inc., No. 8:09CV107, 2009 WL 2225816, at *3 (D. Neb. July 17, 2009); see also Avaya, Inc. v. Mitel Networks Corp., 460 F.Supp.2d 690, 692 (E.D. Va. 2006).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state:
A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that — at the time of its service — the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:
(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and
(B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1).
The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are factually intertwined with the claims asserted in the Georgia litigation. Indeed, one portion of the instant motion concerns settlement negotiations that occurred in the Georgia litigation prior to the venue transfer. The Eighth Circuit applies the "logical relation test" to determine if a counterclaim is mandatory. Tullos v. Parks, 915 F.2d 1192, 1195 (8th Cir. 1990). Under that test, compulsory counterclaims "may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship." Id. (citing Moore v. N. Y. Cotton Exch., 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926)).
Under this test, the allegations in this complaint are logically related to those in the Georgia litigation since they are the reactions of two parties to each other's actions around the sale of the notes at issue. In this manner, the two lawsuits are intrinsically intertwined. The Court declines to determine whether the claims in the Minnesota litigation are actually compulsory counterclaims — this determination properly belongs with the court hearing the underlying claims. However, the Court finds that the probability that the Minnesota claims are compulsory in the Georgia litigation weighs in favor of transferring venue in the interests of justice.
III. Colorado River
The Supreme Court has noted that when an action in federal court is closely related to an action already pending in state court, prudential factors should be considered when deciding whether to exercise federal jurisdiction. Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 817-20. The principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is even stronger with regard to parallel proceedings in two federal courts. Id. at 817; see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon, 259 F.3d at 952-53. When faced with duplicative litigation, a court has at its disposal a "variety of mechanisms . . . to deal with this issue [such as] venue transfer . . . ." Mastro v. Momot, No. 09-01076, 2009 WL 1993772, at *2 (D. Ariz. July 9, 2009); see also Haworth, Inc. v. Herman Miller, Inc., 821 F.Supp. 1476, 1482 (N.D. Ga. 1992) ("Where exceptional circumstances, grounded on considerations of wise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, exist, a district court may decline to review a case where proper jurisdiction exists or transfer the case to a more appropriate venue." (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817)). Given identical parties and the similarity of issues presented in the instant case, the Court finds that the Colorado River principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is a relevant factor in the interests of justice weighing in favor of venue transfer.
In sum, the Court determines that the convenience of the parties and witnesses weighs in favor of venue transfer. Further, for the interests of justice, the purpose of judicial economy, and to avoid potentially duplicitous proceedings with contradictory outcomes, the Court transfers venue for the instant case to United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia through its discretionary power under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).
ORDER
Based on the above considerations, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this case is transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.


FootNotes 
1. Under Section 1404(a), a court must first determine whether the action "might have been brought" in the proposed transferee district. However, given that the Minnesota District Court previously reached this conclusion with regard to the same parties and over intrinsically similar factual allegations, this Court does not repeat this analysis.

Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > FAQs > How can I find out if the name I want is already taken?How can I find out if the name I want is already taken?IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) provides two easy ways to discover the availability of an entity name.The first way is to submit an order to IncNow and we will check the name that business day.The second way is to call us at 1-800-759-2248 or email agents@incnow.com, where a representative can check the availability of a desired entity name at no charge.Checking the State of Delaware’s website for availability can be misleading because the business search tool shows former names that are no longer conflicts but does not display some names which may pose conflicts, for example when the corporate ending is different.You can use the “name reservation” tool at corp.delaware.gov to confirm availability. We do not believe that is usually necessary because it costs $75 and it would be easier to just file the company to see if the name is available.

With years of experience, the incorporation specialists at IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) can assist you with any questions you may have about forming a limited liability company in Delaware. IncNow can help you understand topics such as the common provisions included in Operating Agreements and Certificates of Formation.As a Delaware Commercial Registered Agent, IncNow has a higher filing priority than agents outside of Delaware and self-filers, which means your documents are normally returned to you in 1-3 days, not weeks.    How do you form a Delaware LLC?Choose a Delaware LLC NameRegistering a Delaware LLC requires 2 things:Filing a Certificate of FormationDocumenting your Operating AgreementBefore filing the Certificate of Formation, you must first check the prospective business name with the Delaware Secretary of State for conflicts, which can be done online at Incnow.com.Additionally, Delaware law requires that all new LLCs have either “Limited Liability Company”, “LLC”, or “L.L.C.” in the company name. If, at a later date, you want to change your LLC name, you can do so through an Amendment to the Certificate of Formation.Delaware Registered Agent RequirementYou can form an LLC in Delaware without visiting, opening an office, or maintaining a bank account in Delaware; however, the Delaware LLC Act requires any company incorporated in Delaware to have a Delaware Registered Agent with an in-state street address. Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) will act as Registered Agent for companies incorporating in Delaware for a small annual fee.After formation, the Registered Agent receives State of Delaware notices and is required to be generally available during business hours to accept and forward court notices to you (service of process). The Registered Agent will be there for the life of your company, so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable. Agents and Corporations (IncNow) has been a Delaware Registered Agent since 1974, and at the same office since 1982. IncNow is family operated by Delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate law.Delaware Certificate of Formation RequirementsOur office will sign as the authorized person (also known as an organizer) and file a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State’s Division of Corporations to form the Delaware LLC on public record. Your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you. Other states refer to this document as Articles of Organization, but Delaware does not use that term.A Certificate of Formation must include:The name of the LLCThe name and address of the registered agentThe signature of an authorized individualOf special note, if the Delaware LLC is a Series LLC, which protects assets of parts of the LLC from the liabilities of other parts of the LLC, then this must be indicated on the Certificate of Formation (more information on the Series LLC may be found elsewhere on this site). Many optional provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Formation. Upon special request, we can include the names of members and/or managers on the Certificate of Formation.Delaware LLC Operating AgreementWith our complete package, we draft an Operating Agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures. Delaware requires that LLCs have an Operating Agreement that will govern it; however, Delaware does not require that the Operating Agreement be filed with the state, or even be in writing.It is recommended that you have a written, signed agreement. Even in a single-member Delaware LLC, the Operating Agreement is important because it provides a decision-making structure that will benefit the LLC when dealing with other entities, increase protection, and increase credibility for financial transactions. The Operating Agreement will include provisions such as liability, ownership, dissolution, and transfer of interest, among others.Many incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems. A well-crafted Delaware Operating Agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different direction.Signing the LLC Operating AgreementOnce the Delaware Operating Agreement has been drafted and approved, all members should execute it. Most Delaware LLCs, as a practical matter, will not draft and finalize the Operating Agreement until after formation. Many formal requirements of corporations, such as those related to voting and annual meetings, are not required by LLCs.  To this extent, many well-crafted Operating Agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operations.While an Operating Agreement can be enforceable unsigned, it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned Operating Agreement was agreed upon by all members. In multi-member LLCs, it is especially important to have a signed Operating Agreement. Should you change the agreement or ownership structure, an amended and restated LLC Operating Agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes.    Top 10 Reasons to Form an LLC in Delaware1. Delaware LLCs offer the most protection for you and your business with two-way protectionBy forming a Delaware LLC, you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities. This means that, if the business itself cannot pay a creditor, then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets, such as your house, car and other personal possessions.Delaware explicitly makes the “Charging Order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of LLC members. This prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company. Creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the LLC’s distributions to that member, not a control interest or a right to liquidate the LLC.2. Delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any stateDelaware governs the internal affairs of your company, including its liability shield. The corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the Delaware LLC Act, which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business, is thicker than any protection offered in any other state.3. Delaware LLCs can operate in almost any State or CountryYou can form a Delaware LLC no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the United States. Outside the United States, there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a Delaware LLC, and a Delaware LLC does not need to have a bank account or office in Delaware. A Registered Agent, such as IncNow, maintains a physical address in Delaware required to forward court and Delaware government notices to you.4. Delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businessWhen entering into a Delaware LLC, it is flexible in ownership and management structure. One individual can serve as both the owner and manager. An LLC is governed by its Operating Agreement, allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written. Since the LLC is a contractual entity, it is important that the Delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written. Furthermore, there is no required annual general meeting, and there is much less administrative paperwork in general, compared to a corporation.5. Managers are protected from lawsuitsThe LLC Agreement in Delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties. This allows business managers and controlling, managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors, provided such actions are not in bad faith. Even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced, business managers have the freedom to make business decisions, even if losses result without manager liability, provided the decisions are not self-dealing. Even self-dealing is not entirely prohibited; instead, self-dealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members.6. No Delaware income tax if your operations are in other states (and other business tax loopholes)There is no Delaware tax return to file for LLCs that are formed in Delaware, provided they conduct no business in Delaware.As with LLCs in other states, profits are taxed personally at the member level, but not at the LLC level. An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership, unless it elects S-Corporation or C-Corporation tax status.Having an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation can save thousands in self-employment taxes because your income can be split 50/50 between self-employment income and “S-Dividend” income. The S-Dividend can reduce your taxes by thousands. For example, splitting $200,000 of income would save the S-electing LLC member more than $4,000 in social security and Medicare taxes. Learn more about these advantages in our LLC tax tips section.7. Delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsThe Delaware Secretary of State’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour.8. You can use a Delaware LLC to own and manage almost anythingThe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multi-million dollar commercial properties. It may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets, like real estate or intellectual property.Most common uses include:To hold real property, such as personal or business real estateTo operate a service businessTo hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes, automobiles, boats and patents9. Delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks, not yearsDelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes, the Court of Chancery. Its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases, and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not. There are no jury trials in the Court of Chancery, so Court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the Court.The Delaware court system can act very quickly. Sometimes, the whole process, from start to finish (discovery and motions to trial decisions), can be over in two months. Written decisions from the Court of Chancery are the standard, and are often 100 pages long. This well-reasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes. Even appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court can be expedited. The Delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials.10. Delaware has the most pro-business laws of any US stateDelaware’s law is generally thought to be pro-business, and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses. Because of the maturity of Delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by Delaware’s judicial system, there is predictability in outcomes.This means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your LLC, there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome, which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate. Even when judges change, it is not a favoritism or political system. Judges in Delaware make reasoned, non-political decisions.

What is a Corporation, and what does Incorporating mean?A Corporation is a legal entity or legal “person” that exists completely separate from natural persons, and is typically composed of natural persons that hold stock in the corporation.Incorporating is the act of filing a new corporation.When incorporating, you have the ability to select the state of incorporation, which is the state where the initial paperwork is filed and the state that will govern the internal affairs of your business (relationship between decision makers and owners).Delaware General Corporation Law will protect your corporation only if you select to incorporate in the State of Delaware.Delaware has the most desirable legislature, statutes, case law and court system for corporate governance. Starting in Delaware is an easy choice that some business owners overlook in the haste to get started, but may regret later. Rarely is the state in which you reside as favorable as where the owners reside. After comparing all 50 states, business owners frequently decide to incorporate in Delaware.    Why Should I Incorporate in Delaware?Delaware has a reputation as the forerunner in corporate law in the United States. Industry leading companies, from credit cards (Discover, Bank of America) to technology (Google, Apple) to restaurants (McDonald’s, Chipotle) are incorporated in Delaware. So why should you join them and incorporate your business in Delaware?1. Delaware has the strongest Corporate Shield of any StateThe main reason to incorporate in Delaware is to protect personal assets from your business’s liability. This protection is referred to as the “corporate veil” or “shield”, and is especially strong in Delaware.2. Business-Friendly Government Services Many of the businesses that chose to organize in Delaware have done so because of the business-friendly government in Delaware. Delaware’s Court of Chancery is a specialized business court. With its established body of case law, the Delaware courts are experts at resolving business conflicts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has ranked Delaware’s litigation system the best in the country for fairness every year.3. Ability to Operate a Delaware Corporation in every State or almost any CountryWith a Delaware corporation, you have the ability to conduct business in every state and almost every country. Delaware corporations do not need a bank account or business address in Delaware, they need only a Registered Agent to forward Delaware annual notices and legal notices.4. Predictability in Ownership and Management StructureDelaware’s predictable laws on ownership and management allow you to structure your business with confidence. You can even have the protection of a corporation for a one-person business. For example, one individual can be sole Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the sole shareholder.5. Directors and Officers are protected from lawsuitsBusiness officers and Directors have the ability to take risks and make routine business decisions without fear of having those decisions second guessed by stockholders. Even if losses result, as long as the decisions were not self-dealing, the officers and directors should be protected from personal liability.6. No Delaware income tax returns  for Corporations operating outside of DelawareDelaware corporations do not have to file Delaware tax returns if they do not conduct business in Delaware.7. Tax AdvantagesA corporation is taxed as a C-Corporation unless it elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation. If the stockholders are eligible and timely elect to be taxed as an S-Corporation with the IRS, it can save the stockholders thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes by splitting income 50/50 between self-employment income and an “S-Dividend”.8. Delaware offers speedy document approval and filings The Secretary of State’s office in Delaware maintains extended hours for filing and can approve documents in as little as one hour for additional fees.9. A Delaware Corporation can be used to manage almost anythingCorporations can range from a one personal consulting company to a multi-million dollar technology business. Corporations are not recommended for holding passive assets, like real estate.10. Delaware has the fairest courts and laws of any stateThe United States Chamber of Commerce has recognized Delaware’s business dispute and incorporation climate by ranking Delaware’s litigation system #1 over the past 9 years. The advantage of having so many business disputes resolved in Delaware is that previous conflicts have established an extensive body of case law.    How to Start a Delaware Corporation1. Choose a NameChoose a unique corporate name that is not registered with the Delaware Secretary of State. The name must include a corporate ending or abbreviation thereof (ex. “Inc.”, “Incorporated”, “Company”, “Co..”, “Corporation”, “Corp.”, “Association”, etc.) You can always file a name amendment in the future. For example, when we incorporated “Pinterest,” the original name was “Cold Brew Labs.”2. Find a Registered AgentEvery Delaware corporation is required to have a registered agent in Delaware. The registered agent will forward lawsuits and correspondence from the Delaware Secretary of State to you.You do not need to visit or have an office or any other connection to Delaware to incorporate a corporation in Delaware. Select Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) to act as your registered agent.3. Draft a Certificate of IncorporationThe Certificate of Incorporation officially brings the corporation into existence in the public record. IncNow will prepare a Certificate of Incorporation that includes:Name of the corporationName and address of the Registered Agent of the corporationStatement of the type of business that the corporation will engage inNumber of shares of authorized stock that the corporation will issuePar value of each shareName and signature of the incorporatorIndemnification clause for breaches of Duty of CareAllowance for Director Amended BylawsThe standard form from the Secretary of State leaves off recommended provisions, such as the director amended bylaws and relaxed director liability. These provisions must be included in the Certificate of Incorporation and cannot be enforced if included only in the bylaws or elsewhere.4. Annual Taxes and FeesSimilar to most states, Delaware corporations pay a “franchise tax”, or annual fee. This fee is based either on the shares authorized by the corporation on its Certificate of Incorporation, or any Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that change the number of shares of stock the corporation is allowed to issue.We recommend incorporating with 1500 shares of voting stock to minimize both filing and annual fees. If additional shares of restricted or non-voting stock are desired or required in the future, the authorized number of shares can be amended.5. Stockholder AgreementIf your corporation has more than one stockholder, it should have a Stockholder Agreement.Stockholder agreements are optional, but recommended.They set out the powers and rights of stockholders, as well as their relationship with the corporation and must be executed by all stockholders.A stockholder agreement can place restrictions on transferring stock.Delaware law specifically allows certain restrictions on the rights of stockholders to sell their shares.In closely held corporations with very few stockholders, these agreements are especially important because they will govern the relationship between the stockholders.Notice of the stockholder agreement must also be on the stock certificates to provide notice to possible assignees of the restrictions.Any corporation with more than one stockholder should have a Stockholder Agreement to minimize future problems of valuation, buyback, and unwanted third parties owning stock as transfers or assignees.6. Stockholder Agreement ServiceTo the surprise of many business owners, bylaws do not include provisions for rights of first refusal or buy-out provisions for stockholders. Corporation stockholders should consider a Stockholder Agreement — an important additional service to protect their stockholders’ expectations.We offer a standard Delaware Stockholder Agreement for $199.A Delaware attorney developed this Stockholder Agreement in the course of practice.It has been modified for our customers to provide extra rights and protection for stockholders to prevent outsiders from becoming unwanted stockholders in their company in the event of a sale of stock or death of a shareholder.This document gives you a running start to future planning for your Corporation.    C-Corporations vs. S-CorporationsThe “C” vs. “S” discussion should not impact your pre-incorporation decision. While corporations are C-Corporations by default when they are incorporated, it is very easy to change classifications between C-Corporations and S-Corporations.There is no distinction between the Certificate of Incorporation for a C-Corporation and that for an S-Corporation. Every Corporation filed with any of the 50 US States starts out simply as a general Corporation.    ConclusionDelaware’s pro-business climate, makes it the location of choice for anyone seeking to incorporate their business. Whether large or small, your business can reap the benefits of incorporating in Delaware.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
