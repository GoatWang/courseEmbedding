Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $80,000 as anticipated.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Stepan
Feodosiadi, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company
funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary
if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our
business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic
Bulletin Board when and if our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Feodosiadi will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Stepan Feodosiadi. Mr.
Feodosiadi will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate
additional revenues to pay the obligation.


Based on the fact that we are a start-up Company that has recently started our
operations we assume we will have strong competition from well-developed
companies in our area of work. We face strong competition from Expose Prod Video
Production, Production Service Network, and XYZ Productions, which are all based
in Greece and have developed their names in the industry.


Company Description
Battlers Corp. was incorporated in February 3, 2016, in the state of Nevada,
USA. The Company is located in Greece and is working in the field of short video
production area.
 
Developing our company the management believes that marketing videos remains to
be trendy for every area of advertising


 and keep being popular among developed
and start-up companies. We believe that for the companies, having such a
marketing tool on their websites and any promotions stages it is a step ahead of
competitors in the same area of work. Stepan Feodosiadi, our sole office and
director, believes that powerful video marketing is the most leading marketing
tool that in this industry will have more success in the future perspective.

Marketing videos on the Internet or your website enables you to generate the
engaging experience that you need in successful online marketing. When using
online video marketing on your website, you are informing your website visitors
that they are needed and important to you and that you will invest some time and
effort to ensure that they have a thorough experience when showing up at your
company website or any promotion activities of your company.
