Only one is built on the foundation of our ACE Integrated Fitness Training® Model, created to help health and fitness professionals deliver the type of individualized programs people need to adopt long-term, healthy behaviors. Once you become a Certified Personal Trainer, you will have a career advantage at thousands of facilities nationwide and the expertise you need to stand out among your peers with a certification accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).
Why Choose ACE?
Earning additional ACE certifications means meeting a standard accepted by other leaders in the healthcare industry. In addition to being NCCA accredited for all four certification programs, such as our group fitness certification, ACE also goes above and beyond when it comes to taking care of our professionals. We advocate on your behalf every day—among policymakers, among partners who share our vision of eliminating the obesity epidemic, and among employers exploring workplace wellness solutions.

Declining fuel volume
Decline in retail profit
Stringent environmental regulations
High & dry in a supply emergency
Restrictive credit markets


Difficulty in appealing to consumers
DHEC violations
Aging c-store sites
Environmental, marketing and business challenges with nowhere to turn
Varied knowledge in retail pricing strategies and/or technology use

			Save more with ACE Price Plus		
Any fuel wholesaler can give you a great price - on a good day. Availability changes, though, and many contracts that look attractive at first end up robbing you in the long run.
Consider also the trade-off of a provider who only talks about price. Can you expect a quick response from them when you need fuel fast? What about help on environmental compliance or equipment maintenance? When you go after the cheapest contract, sometimes you unfortunately get what you pay for.
At ACE, we believe the best value is the one that saves you money now and in the long run. That's why we treat your situation as unique, and help you discover the best pricing plan to fit your needs now - and in the future.
Talk to one of our representatives for a no-risk discussion about your fuel needs.
