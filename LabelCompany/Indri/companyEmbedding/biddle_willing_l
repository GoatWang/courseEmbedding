Urstadt Biddle Properties Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying And 4.31% Yield (UBA)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Last Will and Testament

                        Identifies who should receive your property, defines who you want to carry out your wishes and names guardians if you have minor children. All wills must be approved by a court after you pass away.

Living Will

                        Describes your preferences for care in a medical emergency and names someone to carry out your health care wishes. This document is sometimes called an advance directive, health care directive, or medical power of attorney.

Power of Attorney

                        Names someone you trust to manage your finances if you can no longer make decisions for yourself. A power of attorney is only valid while you are alive.
