Description:

FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to keratin hydrolysate complexes with naturally occurring amino acids cystine-cysteine; the keratin derived modified protein being referred to hereinafter throughout the specification as KDMP. The hydrolysate keratin product is prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of a fibrous keratin which contains a family of structurally related water soluble peptides. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a process and product whereby animal parts containing keratin, such as chicken, poultry, or other avian feathers, nails, beaks, and cattle or other animal horns, hooves and hair, are converted into KDMP complexes useful for topical application to human skin and nails to condition the same as hereinafter described. Water soluble peptides present in fibrous keratin, on the average, contain fewer than ten amino acids, and under the conditions of the hydrolysis a number of the component amino acids are subject to chemical modification other than cleavage of peptide bonds. Amino acid analysis reveals an abundance of acidic and neutral amino acids as well as the presence of cystine and its oxidation products, most important of which is cysteine. An amber colored pigment exhibiting both cationic and hydrophobic properties is associated with the protein component. Of the peptides obtained in the initial hydrolysate, in accordance with this invention, approximately 20% exhibit adsorption during a chromatography hydrophobic chromatographic support. During subsequent formulation steps an increasing number of the more polar peptides is lost, such that approximately 90% of the peptides present in the final formulation exhibit hydrophobic properties. Summarily, the protein component is composed of a family of structurally related low molecular weight peptides exhibiting both anionic and hydrophobic properties and containing the amino acid cystine. The presence of naturally occurring cystine-cysteine has been found to be of particular importance in order to provide a product which is free from unpleasant odors. Where cysteine-cystine itself (unnatural) is added, it has been observed that there is a strong tendency for auto-oxidation and decomposition to occur and which produces a product having an unpleasant odor. Whereas, naturally derived or occurring cystine-cysteine obtained from KDMP, and produced as hereinafter described, is stable. The particular characteristic is explained by its reactivity, particularly its redox behavior (cysteine-cystine) which is of fundamental importance in cellular processes. The cystine in KDMP interacts with the abundant disulphide bridges present in keratin, found in the skin, hair and nails, thus markedly influencing the suppleness and elasticity of the skin treated. Apart from the direct improvement in the mechanical properties of the skin, the cystine also exhibits a stimulating effect on the metabolism of the epidermis. It is known with respect to protein components of hair follicles, for example, that they are hydrophobic in nature and contain numerous sulfhydryl amino acid residues. Further, under the neutral or alkaline conditions, in accordance with this invention, cysteine reduction is accelerated in the presence of sulfhydryl containing compounds. Moreover, since the protein component of the present formulation, which contains a natural quantity of cystine, it serves as a thiol reducing reagent, thus increasing the cystine content of the hair. The peptides are absorbed by the hair, and it has been found that their affinity for a hydrophobic surface is favorably affected. These two independent phenomena acting in concert result in the formulation of a proteinaceous film which increases surface solubility, and protects the impact of environmental factors on the hair. The enhanced highlights observed with light reflecting hair colors also is attributed to the presence of a proteinaceous film which is a desirable attribute. In addition, it has been observed that when utilizing the products of this invention, and wherein skin and nails are treated during the process with hot air flow drying, it results in the acceleration of cystine oxidation. Inasmuch as cystine associated with the protein component is absorbed by the hair, the oxidation results in the formation of cysteine molecular bridges between the hair follicle and proteinaceous film; thus stabilizing the film and producing a relatively hard and tough resistant surface on the skin or nail being treated.   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is particularly illustrated by the following examples. In these examples, the keratin protein material is in the form of powder or meal commonly referred to as feathermeal. It should be understood, however, that even though the animal parts are generally cleansed to some extent prior to partial hydrolysis, it is possible and in fact quite often probable that associated non-keratin bearing parts are not removed from the keratin bearing parts. Thus, such material as blood, chicken feet, chicken heads and visera, as well as cattle legs and skin may be mixed with the desirable keratin bearing animal parts. EXAMPLE 1 KDMP Product A round-bottomed flask containing 166 ml. of water is heated to near reflux. To the hot water, 20 grams of strontium hydroxide is added. When the strontium hydroxide is completely dissolved, 20 grams of dry weight feathermeal is added. Where the feathermeal comprises excess fat, the feathermeal is initially washed with acetone or the like fat-solvent material. The mixture is then refluxed for approximately twenty hours at 100 degrees C. under one atmosphere of pressure. Thereafter, the solution is cooled and filtered to recover the hydrolysate, which is then reduced to a pH of 3.0 with a 15% solution of sufuric acid. The precipitate which forms during neutralization is removed by vacuum filtration. The tea-colored solution at pH 3.0, and constituting the KDMP complex, is then heated to near boiling and evaporated to 1/2 its original volume. The resultant concentrated viscous liquid is brought to pH 7.0 with 1N. sodium hydroxide solution. This neutralized viscous liquid proteinaceous extract is stored for about seven days at room temperature (22-25 degrees C.). At the end of the storage time, the extract is heated and all precipitate material re-dissolved. The final KDMP product is a clear viscous liquid which was found to inhibit microbial growth after incubation at room temperature (approx. 25 degrees C.) for 72 hours. The KDMP bactericidal product is useful as a skin mask, anti-blemish skin conditioner, moisturizer, and skin deodorant. EXAMPLE 2 Concentrated KDMP Product A one-liter round-bottom was filled with 249 ml. of water (deionized water was used) and the water was heated to approximately 80 degrees C. To the hot water 30 g. of strontium hydrate were added. Next, the dry weight equivalent of 30 g. of feathermeal as described in Example 1, were added. (On an average summer day in a temperate climate, feathermeal might contain 10-15% moisture. Accordingly, additional feathermeal was added to compensate for the moisture content.) The mixture was then refluxed for eight hours at sea level pressure (1 atmosphere). The solution was allowed to cool in the flask (pH at 11-12.5). A 50% solution of sulfuric acid was added to reduce the in-flask pH to 8.5 to 9.0 (approximately 2 ml. of 50% H2 SO4.) The solution was filtered (filter cake discarded) and stored at room temperature for 48 hours. The filtrate was brought to pH 6.8-7.0 with additional 50% sulfuric acid (approximately 2-3 ml.). The pH 6.8-7.0 filtrate was filtered after sitting at room temperature for two hours with a final KDMP filtrate of pH 7.0. The final KDMP filtrate at pH 7.0 was evaporated by heating and stirring to one-half of its original volume. A portion of the concentrated KDMP (100 ml.) was mixed with 150 ml. of pure methanol (>95%). The resultant white milky mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. After 24 hours the mixture had separated into a straw colored upper phase and white lower phase. The upper phase was decanted and the white lower phase retained as the finished product which is useful as a shampoo enhancer, shaving lotion and nail hardener and conditioner. EXAMPLE 3 KDMP Detergent Type Shampoo A detergent mixture comprising (by volume) 5% coconut diethanolamide and 95% modified alkylolamide is diluted with deionized water by adding 5 volumes of water to each volume of the detergent mixture. The diluted detergent is then allowed to stand for approximately 18 hours or until all air bubbles are removed. Thereafter, to the diluted detergent mixture is added 1 part of concentrated KDMP, as described in Example 2. To this detergent-KDMP mixture is admixed 2 parts water to provide a product having one volume of diluted detergent one volume of KDMP, and which mixture, when stored for 16-18 hours separates into two phases. The resultant precipitate phase is removed by filtration to recover a heavy viscous bottom phase solution. To produce the shampoo product, three different preservatives may be used such as Methyl paraben (methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate) at a concentration of 0.2 percent of the total volume of shampoo being produced. Methyl paraben is dissolved in the detergents. Propyl paraben (propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate) at a concentration of 0.12 percent of the total volume of shampoo being produced. Propyl paraben is dissolved in the water used for formulation. Mercaptoethanol (ME) at a concentration of 0.1 percent of the total volume of shampoo being produced. ME is added to the formulation as the final ingredient. In the production of a shampoo wherein methyl paraben preservative is added to the above-described bottom phase solution, the mixture consists of four parts (by volume) of the bottom phase solution and one part of concentrated KDMP. To the resultant mixture two parts of water is introduced to produce the final shampoo product. Where other preservatives are utilized, for example, mercaptoethanol, it is added as a final step and uniformly mixed into the mixture to provide the shampoo product. Where it is deemed unnecessary, or not desired, no preservative need be introduced in formulating the shampoo. The detergent shampoo product, with or without a preservative, may be utilized as a shampoo enhancer, for example, admixed with other shampoo products, or as a lotion, such as a shaving cream or skin conditioner or as refresher, or as a nail hardener and toughening of film nail conditioner. When the keratin protein cystine-cysteine enriched shampoo is used as an enhancer, e.g., in conjunction with another shampoo, it has been found to improve the body and luster of hair, improve the clarity and reflectivity of the hair's natural highlights, reduce split ends, and observable hair loss on the brush. This use of applicant's new preparation, i.e. as an enhancer, means that the preparation is added to or used in conjunction with a shampoo to improve or enhance the final shampoo product. Its high substantivity results in additional retardation of water loss from the hair strands reducing brittleness and breakage. It fills in irregularities in the hair strands, providing fuller, stronger and more uniform strands of hair. It also has excellent cleansing characteristics, helping the shampoo itself to leave the hair with a longer lasting, "squeaky clean" shampooing effect, with no shampoo build-up. EXAMPLE 4 Alkaline Hydrolysate Preparation A roundbottom flask with 996 ml. of water is heated. To the hot water, 120 grams of strontium hydrate (hydroxide) is added. Next, 120 grams of dry weight feathermeal is added. The mixture is then refluxed for eight hours at 100 degrees C. at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. The cooled solution (pH 11-12.5) is then brought to pH 8.8 to 9.0 with a 15 percent solution of sulfuric acid, and filtered. The resultant alkaline hydrolysate solution at pH 8.8-9.0 can be stored at room temperature and is stable for a period of at least five months. EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of Concentrated KDMP (clear solution) The alkaline hydrolysate of Example 4 is reduced to pH3.0 with the addition of a 15 percent solution of sulfuric acid. The resultant precipitate is removed by vacuum filtration, and the acidified hydrolysate (KDMP) is stored in a covered container for a minimum of two days and up to five days. After the storage period the KDMP is again filtered. The filtrate KDMP at pH 3.0 is heated to boiling and evaporated to one-half of its original volume. The resultant liquid is brought to pH 7.0 with 1 N.-NaOH. This neutralized solution is again reduced to pH 3.0 with the addition of 15 percent sulfuric acid. The resultant heavy viscous fraction is removed by filtration and the clear solution is recovered and returned to a pH 7.0 with 1 N. NaOH. The final product at pH 7.0 is concentrated KDMP as a clear solution. EXAMPLE 6 KDMP and Detergent Partition Formulation A mixture of 5 percent coconut diethanolamide and 95 percent modified alkylolamide is prepared. The detergent mixture is diluted with dionized water by adding 5 volumes of water to each volume of mix detergent. This diluted detergent mixture is allowed to stand for approximately 18 hours or until all bubbles are removed. The diluted detergents are next mixed with concentrated KDMP (of Example 2), the KDMP mixture consisting of one part by volume of diluted detergent to one volume of KDMP. The two phases separate within 6-18 hours and a bottom layer (50-60% volume) is recovered, the top layer being discarded. To the bottom layer, a number of preservatives are added as follows: Methyl paraben (methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate) is added at a concentration of 0.25 percent of the total volume of the formulation being produced. Methyl paraben is dissolved in the detergents. Propyl paraben (propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate) is added at a concentration of 0.10 percent of the total volume of the formulation being produced. Propyl paraben is dissolved in the water used for formulation. Germal 115 (Imidazolidinyl Urea) 0.07 grams per ounce is added at a concentration of 0.25%. In this formulation, a mixture of preservatives is utilized and which comprise modified alkylolamide, triethanolzmine salt of normal dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and coconut diethanolamide in a ratio of 8.5:3:0.5 and wherein 0.5 represents 50 ml., 3 represents 300 ml., and 8.5 equals 850 ml. for a total volume of 1200 ml. Methyl paraben is dissolved in this detergent mixture. To this detergent mixture 4 parts (400 ml.) of the bottom phase and 1 part (100 ml.) from above are combined. To this mixture 2 parts (200 ml.) of water are added. Where parabens are being used as preservatives, propyl paraben and Germal 115 are dissolved in the water prior to its addition to the formulation. The resultant product is the final formulation with the preservatives. The detergent KDMP product is particularly useful as a hair and nail conditioner such as that described in Example 3. Further, inasmuch as keratins have a close structural relationship to human hair, skin and nails, and the natural cystine contained in KDMP, the products of this invention are especially useful for conditioning hair, skin and nails. With respect to nails, for example, the inventive product conditions and helps to prevent the nail from drying out and becoming brittle. Current data indicates that the spaces occurring from normal wear and tear on the surface of the nail are filled in by the product's strong proteinaceous film which also enables the product to adhere strongly to the nail surface. Splitting and peeling of the nail layers is reduced while hardness (thickness) is enhanced, brittleness is reduced, and moisture is retained, making the nail more supple. The product of the invention does not require or contain coloring agents or formaldehyde, such as are commonly found in related products. EXAMPLE 7 Non-concentrated KDMP For use in the preparation of various KDMP products, in accordance with this invention, the alkaline hydrolysate solution, as described in Example 4, is brought to a pH of 3.0 by the addition of a 15% solution of sulfuric acid and the resultant precipitate formed removed by vacuum filtration. The acidified hydrolysate solution is thereafter stored in a closed container for approximately five days. Afer the storage period the hydrolysate solution is again filtered to recover a filtrate constituting the non-concentrated KDMP product, and which is preferably utilized in the preparation of the KDMP product within 18 to 24 hours. Whereas the keratin modified protein products of the invention are adapted for use on natural nails as a hardener and conditioner, it may also be applied, likewise, over lacquer nail polishes where the nail surface is free to receive the same as a tough flexible film coating. While this invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention as described hereinbefore and as defined in the appended claims.

With him on the brief were Joseph F. Nakamura, Sol. and Fred E. McKelvey, Deputy Sol. Also on the brief were Joseph E. DiGenova, U.S. Atty., Royce C. Lamberth, R. Craig Lawrence, Michael J. Ryan and Robert E.L. Eaton, Jr., Asst. U.S. Attys. Before DAVIS, NIES and BISSELL, Circuit Judges. DAVIS, Circuit Judge. This is an appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia upholding the decision of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO or Patent Office) to suspend appellant Edmund Jaskiewicz from practice before the PTO for a period of two years and to place him on probation for an additional five years, based on three counts of misconduct. The District Court (Curran, J.), in a Memorandum Opinion, granted appellee summary judgment and denied appellant's petition for review. We reverse Counts One and Three of the charges of misconduct, uphold Count Two, and remand for reconsideration of the penalty. Appellant was found to have committed three counts of misconduct before the PTO. Count One involved misconduct surrounding appellant's execution and filing of a patent application in the name of Pierre Baronnet. The client was a West German assignee of the inventor, Baronnet. During the course of the United States patent prosecution, Jaskiewicz sent the client a colloquial English version of the Baronnet German patent claims, together with the U.S. claims, with a request that the inventor review the translation in conjunction with the entire patent application. Appellant also requested that Baronnet sign and date an attached declaration. Under 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.57 (Rule 57)2  the inventor was required to sign an oath or declaration in person acknowledging the specification and claims to which it applied.3  The client, in a telephone conversation with appellant, verbally approved the colloquial English translation and requested that Jaskiewicz submit the application along with a declaration that the inventor Baronnet had signed a few months earlier in conjunction with the same application but acknowledging a literal, rather than colloquial, translation of the German claims involved.4  The PTO charged that submission of a patent application with a noncontemporaneous declaration of the inventor was improper under both Rule 57 and 35 U.S.C. § 111.5  The misconduct alleged in Count Two sprang out of appellant's request to amend the filing date of the Baronnet application. Appellant claimed that he had deposited the Baronnet application with the PTO on March 17, 1978, but received a filing date of March 30, 1978. On receipt of the petition to change the date, the PTO sent appellant a Requirement for Information,6  which appellant claimed not to have received. The PTO then sent appellant a duplicate Requirement for Information, which appellant completed and remitted to the PTO. The PTO felt that Jaskiewicz had not adequately answered the queries posed and subsequently sent him a Second Requirement for Information, containing questions identical to those of the First Requirement, and requiring the inventor to answer questions three through seven. Upon reviewing the answers supplied, the PTO was dissatisfied with the replies and forwarded a Third Requirement for Information containing different questions from the First and Second Requirements. In response to the third inquiry, rather than respond to the questions asked, appellant withdrew his Request for a Correction of Filing Date, and petitioned that the application be accorded the March 30, 1978 filing date. The PTO then informed appellant that, since he had failed to answer the questions put forth in the Third Requirement for Information, the application was considered abandoned and forwarded it to the Solicitor of the PTO for review in light of the questions raised. Appellant subsequently submitted his responses to the Third Requirement for Information. In originally answering three of the questions posed by the PTO, the PTO found that appellant tried to mislead the PTO into thinking that the inventor had all the application papers (including the colloquial English version) in front of him when he signed the declaration.7  There was, however, evidence that the inventor had signed the declaration in conjunction with an earlier, literal English translation of the German claims and, at best, only verbally ratified the later colloquial translation some months later. The PTO contended that appellant breached his obligation of candor and good faith as required under 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.56 (Rule 56) in answering the Requirement for Information regarding the Baronnet application. The PTO further contended that appellant had engaged in fraud, deceit and misrepresentation in answering the questions, in violation of 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344, Canon 1 and DR 1-102(A) (4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association (1970). Count Three involved misconduct surrounding appellant's filing of a patent application in the name of Schorwerth. Appellant Jaskiewicz prepared a specification and claims and sent them, along with a blank declaration, to the patent department of his West German client with instructions that the inventor review and return all the documents to appellant so that appellant could file them with the PTO. The client sent Jaskiewicz only the signed declaration and remitted the remaining materials directly to the PTO. Jaskiewicz was unaware that the client had remitted the original application to the PTO and, in light of a potential priority deadline, independently filed the executed declaration plus a copy of the specification and claims with the PTO. Jaskiewicz's application was therefore duplicative and the Patent Office held it abandoned as unnecessary. When questioned about the filing activity surrounding the Schorwerth Application, Jaskiewicz presented uncontroverted testimony that he communicated by telephone with the West German client after he received the signed declaration but prior to filing the application with the PTO. Appellant asserted that the client in the West German patent department was not certain whether it had already submitted the application to the PTO. Appellant testified that, because a priority deadline was approaching, he submitted the duplicate materials to the PTO in order to secure priority. Jaskiewicz also submitted notes allegedly substantiating this telephone communication, but the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that the notes had been fabricated. The ALJ's conclusion was based, however, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of the facts in the case. Specifically, the ALJ confused the facts incident to the Baronnet application with those in the Schorwerth application. Appellant did not produce any other papers regarding the Schorwerth application, contending that he had disposed of the files upon learning that the application had been abandoned as duplicative. The PTO concluded that Jaskiewicz knew or should have known that the Schorwerth application was improperly signed but nonetheless deposited the application in the Patent Office. The PTO alleged that such actions violated Rule 56, 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344, Canon 1 and DR 1-102(A) (4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association. A hearing was conducted before an ALJ of the PTO on September 26, 1983. By Recommended Decision of August 16, 1984, the ALJ found that there was sufficient evidence8  that appellant had committed the acts of misconduct charged and recommended disbarment. On appeal to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, the Commissioner adopted, with modifications, the recommended decision of the ALJ on October 1, 1984.9  The Decision and Order stated that appellant had violated 37 C.F.R. Secs. 1.344, 1.56, and 1.57, as well as Canon 1 and DR 1-102(A) (4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association. Appellant was suspended from practice before the PTO for a period of two years and placed on probation for an additional five years. Jaskiewicz then filed a petition in the District Court for the District of Columbia under 35 U.S.C. § 32. The District Court concluded that substantial evidence supported the decision of the PTO, granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee and denied appellant's petition for review. This appeal followed.10  The Government's position is essentially that, in prosecuting the Baronnet and Schorwerth patent applications, the appellant was derelict in his duty of candor and good faith in practice before the PTO, in violation of Rule 56. The Government also asserts that appellant's actions amounted to fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit in violation of 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344, Canon 1 and DR 1-102(A) (4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Appellant urges us to adopt the position that under Rule 56, which pertains to inequitable conduct before the PTO, sanctions are limited solely to holding a patent unenforceable. Appellant therefore claims that no attorney sanctions are proper under Rule 56.11  However, Rule 56 expressly charges the attorney with a duty of candor and good faith before the Patent Office. In instances where a person entitled to practice before the PTO has breached that duty of candor and good faith in prosecuting a patent application, it may well be appropriate or necessary to issue sanctions directly against that attorney or agent--at least in circumstances where there has been an intent to deceive, defraud, or make misrepresentations to the PTO. This view is consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in Kingsland v. Dorsey, 338 U.S. 318, 319, 70 S. Ct. 123, 124, 94 L. Ed. 123 (1949), where the Court, in affirming an order of the Commissioner of Patents barring an attorney from practicing before the PTO, stated that "the relationship of attorneys to the Patent Office requires the highest degree of candor and good faith." Furthermore, in In re Milmore, 196 USPQ 628 (Comr.Pats.1977) a registered patent agent was suspended by the Commissioner for having intentionally breached his duty of candor and good faith after having failed to call a pertinent reference to the attention of the patent examiner during the prosecution of the application. The Commissioner stated: It is in my opinion an abuse of a patent practitioners [sic] professional responsibility to knowingly withhold from the examiner the name and number of any reference which he believes would render certain claims of an application invalid if he were to succeed in getting them allowed.... For the foregoing reasons, the single charge placed against respondent is sustained. Id. at 630 (emphasis added). We agree with this position.12  In addition to holding that Jaskiewicz had violated his duty of candor and good faith, the ALJ and the Commissioner also concluded that appellant's conduct in prosecuting the Baronnet and Schorwerth applications violated Canon 113  and DR-1-102(4)14  of the American Bar Association (ABA) Code of Professional Responsibility15  and 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344.16  The basis for the ALJ's conclusion and the Commissioner's position on this appeal is that Jaskiewicz engaged in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation in prosecuting the two applications in this case. This court and one of its predecessors have discussed at great length the issues of fraud and misrepresentation (as they relate to Rule 56 in the context of inequitable conduct before the PTO relating to prosecution of a patent application). E.g., J.P. Stevens & Co. v. Lex Tex Ltd., 747 F.2d 1553, 223 USPQ 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 822, 106 S. Ct. 73, 88 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1985); American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F.2d 1350, 220 USPQ 763 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 821, 105 S. Ct. 95, 83 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1984); Norton v. Curtiss, 433 F.2d 779 (CCPA 1970). In Norton the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals took account of the high degree of confidence and trust that must exist between the PTO and applicants for patents, but also noted that materiality was a critical concern in analyzing fraudulent conduct. Norton, supra at 793-94. Materiality (under Rule 56) is defined as "a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent." Intent (or knowledge) is another critical element which must be present in determining whether there has been fraud or inequitable conduct. There must be not only a misrepresentation, but also actual knowledge of falsity or an obligation to know it. Mere negligence is not sufficient to infer fraud or dishonesty though gross negligence may lead (in proper circumstances) to a finding of inequitable conduct. N.V. Akzo v. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 810 F.2d 1148, 1 USPQ2d 1704 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We hold that, as to Counts One and Three, there was insufficient evidence, under the "clear and convincing evidence" standard, to sustain the administrative findings of fraud and deliberate intent to mislead. That higher standard is normally applicable to proof of fraud or dishonesty. SSIH Equipment S.A. v. United States Int'l. Trade Comm'n, 718 F.2d 365, 380-81, 218 USPQ 678, 691 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (separate opinion of Nies, J.). Correlatively, the judicial standard of review calls for more scrutiny than if the trier's standard were merely "preponderance of the evidence." Id. at 383, 218 USPQ at 692. We do not reach the question whether appellant's departures from normal requirements in filing the Baronnet and Schorwerth applications created material differences (or whether materiality is important in this kind of case) because we hold that there was inadequate proof that Jaskiewicz intended to deceive the PTO when he filed those applications.17  True, the PTO is under severe limitations as to time and manpower, and it is incumbent upon attorneys and agents who prosecute patent applications to follow the procedural rules of the PTO. See Precision Instruments Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 816, 65 S. Ct. 993, 998, 89 L. Ed. 1381, 65 USPQ 133, 138 (1945); Gemveto Jewelry Co. v. Lambert Bros., Inc., 542 F. Supp. 933, 938, 216 USPQ 976, 980 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). But appellant's actions as charged in Counts One and Three--while clearly lacking prudent judgment, negligent, and perhaps grossly negligent--do not rise to the level of intentional misconduct charged as the reason to deprive him for a substantial time of such a valuable right as the privilege to practice before the PTO. The PTO must look to all the facts and circumstances involving the questionable conduct before finding intentional misconduct. In the case of the Baronnet application (Count One), the PTO particularly failed to take into consideration the difficulty of working with a foreign client18  which in this case was not the inventor himself but, rather, an assignee of the inventor.19  That foreign client resolutely refused to ask the inventor for a new declaration. In those circumstances appellant might well have thought that it made no real difference to the PTO if the earlier declaration were used after oral reconfirmation from the client. With respect to the Schorwerth application (Count Three) the facts are likewise insufficient to prove fraudulent intent by clear and convincing evidence. Appellant presented uncontroverted evidence to the ALJ that he had made and recorded a telephone call to the West German client in regard to the filing of the Schorwerth application. The Commissioner presented no evidence to refute that Jaskiewicz had, indeed, had the telephone conversation. While the ALJ concluded that Jaskiewicz was not telling the truth, it is clear that that credibility determination was based in large part on a mistaken conception of the facts--mixing up the incidents of the Baronnet application with those of the Schorwerth application. Because of the nature of disciplinary proceedings, it was incumbent on the Commissioner to prove that appellant is not fit to practice before the PTO. The Commissioner was therefore in error in requiring Jaskiewicz to corroborate his testimony; rather, the burden of proof remained with the Commissioner to prove that appellant was "no longer worthy of his office." Charlton v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 543 F.2d 903 (D.C. Cir. 1976). That burden was not borne as to appellant's testimony. Moreover, there was a priority problem and appellant was anxious to file as soon as possible, so he made a duplicative filing--attaching the inventor's declaration to a copy of the application. If all these facts are accepted--as they must be--there is too slight a basis to say that Jaskiewicz intended to mislead the PTO when he simply made the duplicative filing. The result is that Counts One and Three cannot stand.20  We take a different position on Count Two. The PTO charged that Jaskiewicz had not acted in candor and good faith before the PTO (in violation of Rule 56) and had engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit (in violation of Canon 1, DR-1-102(4), and 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344) in answering the first Requirement for Information as to the Baronnet application. That Requirement asked the following now-relevant questions: 5. Was the declaration attached to the application when it was executed?6. If no, of what was the applicant averring to be the inventor? 7. What did the applicant have before him when he executed the declaration? 8. Did counsel receive the application from the applicant in the condition in which it was deposited in the Office and, if not, what were the differences between the application received and the application deposited? Jaskiewicz's response to these interrogatories was as follows: 5. The executed Declaration in its altered form was attached to the application when received by counsel. 6. No answer necessary. 7. Presumably, the applicant had before him the specification claims and prints of the drawings when the Declaration was executed. 8. Counsel received the application from the applicant in the condition in which it was deposited in the Patent Office and there were no differences between the application as received and the application as deposited. The record shows that, at the time appellant made those responses, he knew all the relevant facts about the signing and oral confirmation of the original Baronnet declaration. He had himself described the procedure (as to that declaration) as "questionable." He must have known, from the PTO's issuance of the Requirement for Information, that the PTO was somehow troubled by the Baronnet application. Nevertheless, he conveyed to the PTO none of the difficulties and complexities of the Baronnet history which clearly affected--most directly--the answers he should have given to questions 5, 7, and 8.21  Instead, his responses replied to the inquiries exactly as if the Baronnet application had been handled precisely in the way the PTO later argued that it should have been. The true facts (as he knew them) were withheld, misleading statements were made, and the clear impression was given that everything had been normal. The PTO found that all this was done deliberately in order to mislead the PTO, and there is enough substantial evidence to support those findings (assuming they had to be made under the "clear and convincing" standard of proof). See Heinemann v. United States, 796 F.2d 451, 454, 230 USPQ 430, 433 (Fed. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 107 U.S. 1565, 94 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1987). In particular, it was impossible for appellant to have innocently answered question 8 as he did; in view of the facts he then knew, it is simply unbelievable that he actually thought that it was a completely true response to say summarily: "Counsel received the application from the applicant in the condition in which it was deposited in the Patent Office and there were no differences between the application as received and the application as deposited." That response entirely omitted the critical facts that the inventor had actually signed the declaration before the United States application had been prepared and had then done no more than orally confirm the United States application. The strained explanations appellant now proffers22  are wholly insufficient to justify his total failure to make mention of the facts on which his extraordinary theories rest, so that the PTO would understand why he thought the Baronnet application was properly filed. The absence of any real details is, in itself, a strong factor for finding his responses to have been fraudulent and deliberately lacking in candor. We conclude that we must sustain the PTO's and District Court's conclusion that appellant intended, in answering the PTO's Requirement for Information, to obfuscate the actual circumstances surrounding the execution and filing of the Baronnet application. There is no excuse for appellant's having intentionally tried to mislead the PTO, particularly after it was plain that the Patent Office suspected some irregularities in the Baronnet application. The PTO rightly relies, and should be able to rely, upon attorneys and agents to answer its queries honestly and forthrightly. Even though we sustain Count Two, a grave offense, we remand to the PTO for reconsideration of the penalty. Appellant is 63 years old and has been a solo patent practitioner for a number of years. A two-year suspension will very likely preclude him from ever again practicing before the PTO; he will probably lose his practice and be unable to regain it after the lapse of the two years. We think that consequence is too severe a sanction for his offense, bad though it was, in the light of his heretofore blameless record and the fact that no patentee or applicant lost any rights because of his actions. The consequences of effective disbarment are especially serious because the attorney is not only deprived of professional honor but also stripped permanently of his chosen means to a livelihood. Dorsey v. Kingsland, 173 F.2d 405, 406 (D.C. Cir.), rev'd on other grounds, 338 U.S. 318, 70 S. Ct. 123, 94 L. Ed. 123 (1949). The PTO should therefore reconsider the sanction in the light of all the circumstances of the case. AFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED. NIES, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part. The Commissioner's decision to suspend appellant was based on three charges. Two charges have been thrown out. I cannot agree that the single remaining charge rises to the statutory level of incompetence, disrepute, or gross misconduct, or such blatant or deceitful violation of PTO regulations to provide the necessary foundation for the Commissioner's action of suspending a practitioner from practice. See 35 U.S.C. § 32 (1982).*  Given the appellant's long and apparently unblemished career, a factor which must be taken into account, and his full answers to the Commissioner's Third Requirement for Information when the Commissioner's questions became specific, the foundation for the Draconian action of suspension is simply, in my view, not present. Appellant explains he first answered the Commissioner's Requirement for Information as one would interrogatories, revealing as little as possible. That was poor judgment--the PTO should not be treated as an adversary--but not gross misconduct. I do not condone appellant's lack of candor in dealing with the Office. Under the circumstances, the Commissioner could and should have warned appellant that the Commissioner deemed his actions unacceptable and could and should have noted the incident against appellant's record which might then be taken into account if future incidents showed a pattern of sharp practice. To deprive appellant of his livelihood on the circumstances here, however, even for a de minimis period, is not justified under the statutory authority of the Commissioner. Thus, a remand for mitigation is inappropriate. Under the statute, the Commissioner can only "suspend or exclude" an attorney. The single incident of misconduct here has not been shown to meet the threshold level of culpable intent for such action.  1  The facts recited in this part are based on those found or accepted in the Commissioner's decision  2  37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.57 stated: The application must be signed by the applicant in person. The signature to the oath or declaration will be accepted as the signature to the application provided the oath or declaration is attached to and refers to the specification and claims to which it applies. Otherwise the signature must appear at the end of the specification after the claims. Full names must be given without abbreviation together with any other given name or initial.  3  Rule 57 is no longer in existence  4  The foreign client refused to ask the inventor for a second declaration  5  35 U.S.C. § 111 states: Application for patent shall be made by the inventor, except as otherwise provided in this title, in writing to the Commissioner. Such application shall include (1) a specification as prescribed by section 112 of this title; (2) a drawing as prescribed by section 113 of this title; and (3) an oath by the applicant as prescribed by section 115 of this title. The application must be signed by the applicant and accompanied by the fee required by law.  6  The PTO issues Requirements for Information when questions are raised regarding the propriety of an application. In this instance, the Requirements for Information were issued in order to obtain enough information to determine whether the application was properly executed and, therefore, entitled to any filing date  7  The application papers consist of the specification and claims of the invention together with an oath or declaration. 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.51  8  At the hearing, the ALJ commented that prior case law made it unclear whether the standard of proof in cases involving attorney misconduct was clear and convincing evidence or the preponderance of the evidence. The ALJ concluded, however, that sufficient evidence in the record could support the conclusion that Jaskiewicz violated his duties of candor and good faith before the PTO and was involved in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation under either standard. See also Dorsey v. Kingsland, 173 F.2d 405, 410 (D.C. Cir.), rev'd on other grounds, 338 U.S. 318, 70 S. Ct. 123, 94 L. Ed. 123 (1949)  9  The Commissioner recognized that the ALJ had confused the facts relating to the Baronnet application with those of the Schorwerth application and took this into consideration when issuing the modified opinion  10  This court has jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a) (1). See Wyden v. Commissioner, 807 F.2d 934, 231 USPQ 918 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Jaskiewicz v. Mossinghoff, 802 F.2d 532, 231 USPQ 477 (D.C. Cir. 1986)  11  Jaskiewicz's primary point is that Rule 56 was not promulgated under 35 U.S.C. § 31 ("Regulations for agents and attorneys") and that 35 U.S.C. § 32 ("Suspension or exclusion from practice") authorizes (in pertinent part) such action only where the attorney is "shown to be incompetent or disreputable, or guilty of gross misconduct, or who does not comply with the regulations established under section 31 of this title ..." (emphasis added)  12  In effect, in disciplinary proceedings, Rule 56 is not applied because there is a violation of "regulations established under section 31 of this title" but because the attorney, in knowingly violating Rule 56, is guilty of "gross misconduct" or is violating 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344, infra, n. 16  13  Canon 1 states: A lawyer should assist in maintaining the integrity and competence of the legal profession  14  DR 1-102(4) states: A lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation  15  We note that disciplinary action under the ABA Model Rules is properly pursued under the Disciplinary Rules (DR's) but not the more general Canons of Ethics. The ABA promulgated the DR's "to be adopted by appropriate agencies as an inspirational guide to the members of the profession and as a basis for disciplinary action when the conduct of a lawyer falls below the required minimum standards stated in the Disciplinary Rules." ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, ABA/BNA Lawyers' Manual on Professional Conduct (BNA) 01:301 (1986). In contrast, the Canons "are statements of axiomatic norms, expressed in general terms, from which the Disciplinary Rules are derived." Id. at 01:302. In this case, the PTO brought a disciplinary action against appellant under both Canon 1 and DR-1-102, which was not the ABA's intention. The PTO should have pursued appellant's infractions, if at all, under the appropriate DR, in this instance, DR-1-102  16  This section, entitled "Professional Conduct," directs practitioners before the PTO to conform to the standards of ethical and professional conduct set forth in the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association  17  As shown in Part III, supra, the case against appellant proceeded, both under Rule 56 and under the cited regulations, as involving a subjective attempt to deceive the PTO. The disciplinary proceeding did not attempt to sanction appellant merely on the basis of gross negligence that does not lead to an inference of deceit  18  As noted in the ALJ's opinion, Jaskiewicz "testified that foreign companies normally handle everything through their patent departments; there is generally no direct contact between the [U.S. patent agent] and the inventor himself."  19  We nonetheless reject appellant's contention that he should be excused from compliance with Rule 57 because the rule was ambiguous. There is substantial evidence on the record below to support the ALJ's conclusions that Jaskiewicz knew or should have known that the submission of a non-contemporaneous declaration did not comport with the formal requirements of the rule. Appellant had practiced before the PTO since 1955 and there is evidence in the record that he advised his client that the procedure was questionable  20  The Commissioner has stated that Counts One and Three are much less serious than is Count Two and, taken alone, (absent the Second Count) might have resulted in a suspension of perhaps a few months with a two to three year probation period  21  Those problems included: (1) the inventor's signing the declaration before the colloquial English version of the German patent claims was made, and with only the German patent application and claims with their literal English translation then before the inventor; (2) subsequent telephonic confirmation by the foreign client that the inventor had orally confirmed the U.S. claims and application; and (3) appellant's client's refusal to ask the inventor to execute a second declaration  22  These include (1) the declaration was not executed when it was actually signed but when it was orally confirmed by the inventor; (2) the "heading" after question 2 refers to possible alterations in the application (referring to differences in type)--but it is clear that that "heading" referred only to questions 3 and 4, not to the remaining ones; (3) an "application" does not legally exist unless it contains the prescribed fee; and (4) the questions were ambiguous, which they were not  *  Sec. 32. Suspension or exclusion from practice The Commissioner may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend or exclude, either generally or in any particular case, from further practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, any person, agent, or attorney shown to be incompetent or disreputable, or guilty of gross misconduct, or who does not comply with the regulations established under section 31 of this title....

No. 86-5073.
United States Court of Appeals,District of Columbia Circuit.
Oct. 7, 1986.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 84-03292).
Joseph E. diGenova, U.S. Atty., Royce C. Lamberth, R. Craig Lawrence, Robert E.L. Eaton, Jr., Asst. U.S. Attys. and Harris A. Pitlick, Assoc. Sol., Commission of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, D.C., were on appellee's motion to transfer.
Joseph G. Dail, Jr., McLean, Va., was on appellant's opposition to the motion.
Before MIKVA, EDWARDS and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge EDWARDS.
HARRY T. EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:


1
The appellant, Edmund M. Jaskiewicz, seeks to raise an appeal from a judgment of the District Court denying his petition for review of an order suspending him from practice before the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).  By Decision and Order dated October 1, 1984, Jaskiewicz was suspended, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32 (1982),1 for misconduct in the representation of parties before the PTO.  Jaskiewicz then initiated a law suit in District Court to overturn the disciplinary action taken against him by the PTO.


2
The District Court rejected Jaskiewicz's claims by summary judgment entered on December 5, 1985, and Jaskiewicz noted an appeal to this court on January 30, 1986.  In response, the appellee, Gerald J. Mossinghoff, the Commissioner of the PTO, filed a motion with this court claiming that proper jurisdiction for this appeal lies with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and praying that the appeal be transferred to that court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631 (1982).  For the reasons stated below, we grant the motion.

I. BACKGROUND

3
Jaskiewicz was admitted to practice before the PTO (formerly the "Patent Office") in 1955.  By notice dated May 19, 1983, the Solicitor of the PTO instituted disciplinary proceedings under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32 for suspension or disbarment of Jaskiewicz, charging him with three counts of misconduct in the representation of parties before the PTO.  The notice alleged violations of 35 U.S.C. Sec. 111 (1982), 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.56 (1985), 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.57 (1982), 37 C.F.R. Sec. 1.344 (1983), and Canon 1 and DR 1-102(A)(4) of the Code of Professional Responsibility (37 C.F.R. Secs. 10.21 & 10.23(b)(4) (1985)).


4
In his answer to the PTO, Jaskiewicz admitted some of the factual allegations and denied others.  He also asserted that the Commissioner had exceeded his statutory authority and violated the procedures required by law.  However, Jaskiewicz's principal defense was that the cited regulations were vague and subject to different interpretations and, therefore, it was arbitrary and capricious for the PTO to discipline him when he acted in a manner consistent with what he reasonably believed were permissible interpretations of the agency's regulations.


5
After a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") issued a decision recommending that Jaskiewicz be disbarred.  Subsequently, on October 1, 1984, following consideration of Jaskiewicz's exceptions to the ALJ's recommended decision, the Deputy Commissioner of the PTO issued a Decision and Order suspending Jaskiewicz from practice before the PTO for seven years.  Jaskiewicz was actually to be barred from practice for the first two years of the suspension, with the last five years to be served on probation.


6
Jaskiewicz commenced this action in the District Court by filing a Petition for Review pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32.  In an Order filed December 5, 1985, the District Court entered summary judgment for the Commissioner.  Jaskiewicz noted his appeal to this court on January 30, 1986.  On June 27, 1986, the Commissioner filed the pending Motion to Transfer.

II. ANALYSIS

7
"It is well settled that ... jurisdiction of a Circuit Court of the United States is limited in the sense that it has no other jurisdiction than that conferred by the Constitution and the laws of the United States."   Hanford v. Davies, 163 U.S. 273, 279, 16 S. Ct. 1051, 1053, 41 L. Ed. 157 (1896).  In the instant case, the Commissioner asserts that the appellant's suit is a "civil action arising under [an] Act of Congress relating to patents" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338(a) (1982).  Because, under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1295(a)(1) (1982 & Supp. III 1985), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is granted exclusive jurisdiction over "an appeal from a final decision of a district court ... if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on section 1338 [of title 28,]" the Commissioner contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.  The question of proper appellate jurisdiction of an action challenging a suspension or disbarment from practice before the PTO under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32, and whether such an action is one "arising under [an] Act of Congress relating to patents" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338(a), is one of first impression.  It is to this question that we now turn.

A.

8
The district courts have original jurisdiction over "any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents...."  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338(a) (1982).  Prior to October 1, 1982, jurisdiction over appeals relating to patents would lie in the court of appeals in the circuit in which the suit was initiated.  However, the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25, granted exclusive jurisdiction over appeals in cases arising in whole or in part under federal laws relating to patents to the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  28 U.S.C. Sec. 1295(a)(1) (1982 & Supp. III 1985).


9
The appellant asserts, and the Commissioner concedes, that Jaskiewicz's principal cause of action rests on 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32, under the portion of the federal patent law covering the Patent and Trademark Office.  Section 32 specifically authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or exclude attorneys from further practice before the PTO;  the section also states that anyone so disciplined may seek judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  However, the obvious applicability of section 32 in no way resolves the question whether appellant's suit arises "under any Act of Congress relating to patents."    28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338(a) (1982).  The critical question here is whether the federal legislation establishing the PTO, and setting forth its authority to discipline those who practice before the agency, is an "Act of Congress relating to patents."

B.

10
In order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338, the Federal Circuit has held that a "plaintiff must have asserted some right or interest under the patent laws, or at least some right or privilege that would be defeated by one or sustained by an opposite construction of those laws."   Beghin-Say Int'l, Inc. v. Rasmussen, 733 F.2d 1568, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1984);  see also Dubost v. United States Patent & Trademark Office, 777 F.2d 1561, 1564 (Fed.Cir.1985).  It appears that the Federal Circuit has given a broad construction to the "relating to patents" language in section 1338, at least in part because "one of the primary objectives of [the Circuit's] enabling legislation is to bring about uniformity in the area of patent law....  [The Federal Circuit], thus, has a mandate to achieve uniformity in patent matters."   Panduit Corp. v. All States Plastic Mfg. Co., 744 F.2d 1564, 1574 (Fed.Cir.1984).  We wholeheartedly agree with our sister circuit's assessment of congressional intention regarding the applicability of section 1338.


11
On the facts of this case, and in light of the precedent from the Federal Circuit construing section 1338, we conclude that it cannot be doubted that Jaskiewicz's action is one "arising under [an] Act of Congress relating to patents."    We can hardly imagine the Federal Circuit seeking "to achieve uniformity in patent matters" without exclusive jurisdiction over appeals relating to who may practice before the Patent and Trademark Office.

C.

12
In his petition for review to the District Court, Jaskiewicz asserted a "right or interest under the patent laws" in retaining his license as a practicing attorney before the PTO.  "The privilege of practicing law 'is not "a matter of grace and favor" ';  on the contrary, as quite recently recorded, 'we have always viewed an attorney's license to practice as a "right" which cannot lightly or capriciously be taken from him.' "   Charlton v. FTC, 543 F.2d 903, 906 (D.C.Cir.1976) (quoting Willner v. Committee on Character & Fitness, 373 U.S. 96, 102, 83 S. Ct. 1175, 1179, 10 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1963) and Kivitz v. SEC, 475 F.2d 956, 962 (D.C.Cir.1973)).  It is likewise clear that the right and interest asserted by Jaskiewicz rest on an interpretation of the applicable laws and regulations governing practice before the PTO.  We believe that these laws and regulations are paradigmatic examples of laws "relating to patents."


13
Because of the highly specialized nature of patent law, otherwise licensed attorneys are not automatically or routinely licensed to practice before the PTO.  The Commissioner of the PTO is empowered to prescribe regulations governing the recognition and conduct of persons practicing patent law.  35 U.S.C. Sec. 31 (1982).  Persons who seek to become practitioners must "show that they are of good moral character and reputation and are possessed of the necessary [legal, scientific, and technical] qualifications to render to applicants or other persons valuable service, advice, and assistance in the presentation or prosecution of their applications or other business before the Office."    35 U.S.C. Sec. 31 (1982);  37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.7(a) (1985).  With the exception of persons who have actively served for at least four years in the patent examining corps of the PTO, "each applicant for registration must take and pass an examination...."  37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.7(b) (1985).  "The examination will not be administered as a mere academic exercise."    Id.


14
The right to practice patent law is not irrevocable.  The Commissioner has prescribed Canons and Disciplinary Rules that govern the practice of patent law.  37 C.F.R. Secs. 10.20-10.112 (1985).  The Commissioner has delegated the responsibility to investigate possible violations of the Disciplinary Rules to the Director of Enrollment and Discipline.  37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.131 (1985).  If the Director believes that a practitioner has violated a Disciplinary Rule, he must call a meeting of the Committee on Discipline.  37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.132(a) (1985).  If the Committee determines that probable cause exists to believe that a practitioner has violated a Disciplinary Rule, then disciplinary proceedings are instituted by filing a complaint under 37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.134 (1985) alleging violation of those Disciplinary Rules.  37 C.F.R. Sec. 10.132(b) (1985).


15
This maze of laws and regulations relating to practice before the PTO obviously is designed to facilitate the work of the agency in resolving the inherently complex substantive questions arising over issues of patentability under the patent laws.  We find no meaningful way to distinguish between issues of "practice" and "substance" in this case, and thus view all of the issues relating to practice before the PTO as "relating to patents."

D.

16
The Federal Circuit has also held that its appellate jurisdiction is not limited to scientific or technical aspects of patent law, but extends to matters that relate to the practice of patent law before the PTO.  In Dubost, counsel for Dubost submitted all necessary documents with a patent application claiming priority based on a French application.  However, counsel neglected to sign the check submitted to pay the required fee.  The original submission was within the one-year time limit to gain priority for a foreign patent, but by the time the check was signed and resubmitted, the one-year time limit had expired.  Dubost filed a petition seeking to establish the original submission date as the date for establishing priority for the application.  The PTO denied the petition, ruling that the receipt of the signed check established priority as of that date.  The Commissioner denied a petition for reconsideration, and Dubost commenced an action in District Court.  The District Court found that it had jurisdiction pursuant only to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1361 (1982), the mandamus statute, and that Dubost had failed to demonstrate that a clear duty owed to him was either unfulfilled or performed in an arbitrary or capricious manner.


17
In reviewing Dubost's claim, the Federal Circuit found that the district court had jurisdiction at least in part under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338:


18
[I]t is not controlling that Dubost's claim does not appear to be created by the patent laws in the same sense as the bulk of Sec. 1338(a) cases.


19
Dubost's complaint made to the district court clearly stated a right or interest that would be defeated or sustained by the construction given to the patent laws.  If, as Dubost alleged, an unsigned check satisfies the requirement contained in [35 U.S.C.] Sec. 111 that the application be "accompanied by the fee required by law," he will gain the benefit of his foreign priority date.  If the unsigned check were held not to satisfy the Sec. 111 requirement, he will not be entitled to claim priority.  Thus, the district court's resolution of this case necessarily entailed a construction of the fee requirement of Sec. 111.  Further, the construction of the statute directly affects Dubost's entitlement to priority under [35 U.S.C.] Sec. 119.  Assuming the existence of an intervening reference, loss of priority could have an adverse impact upon Dubost in a variety of ways, from requiring a narrowing of his claims to divesting him of the entirety of his prospective substantive patent rights.


20
We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction over the subject case under, inter alia, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338(a).


21
777 F.2d at 1565.


22
In the instant case, Jaskiewicz is alleged to have violated 35 U.S.C. Sec. 111, the precise provision at issue in Dubost.    In Dubost, the PTO arguably could have brought proceedings against Dubost's attorney under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32 for violating section 111 by failing to sign the check.  Any adverse action against Dubost's attorney could then have been reviewed by the District Court.  If the section 32 claim was seen as one not arising under an act relating to patents, an appeal could be taken in this court from the judgment of the District Court, even though the Federal Circuit had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the substantive effect of the same action (failure to sign the check) giving rise to the proceeding under section 111 in Dubost.    Such a result would make little sense.  If the original action in Dubost arises under a law relating to patents, any related action under section 32 should be viewed in the same light, because the later action hinges significantly upon the legitimacy of the PTO's view of the substantive requirements of section 111.  Any other result would defeat the goal of uniformity in the application of the patent laws.  If we were to find that the Federal Circuit does not have exclusive jurisdiction of section 32 cases, the reach of Dubost would be significantly diminished.2


23
The right to practice patent law arises under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 31 (1982).  Although, as noted in Dubost, this right is "not created by the patent laws in the same sense as the bulk of Sec. 1338(a) cases," it surely may "be defeated or sustained by the construction given the patent laws."    777 F.2d at 1565.  Therefore, to maintain the uniformity mandated by Congress in the area of patent law, the Federal Circuit must retain exclusive jurisdiction over the instant appeal.3

III. CONCLUSION

24
An action for review of a decision of the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office disciplining an attorney pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32 arises under an Act of Congress relating to patents.  Therefore, jurisdiction in the District Court is based at least in part on 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338, and appellate review of that court's decision is granted exclusively to the Federal Circuit by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1295(a).  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, this case shall be transferred to United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.



1
 35 U.S.C. Sec. 32 reads as follows:
The Commissioner may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend or exclude, either generally or in any particular case, from further practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, any person, agent, or attorney shown to be incompetent or disreputable, or guilty of gross misconduct, or who does not comply with the regulations established under section 31 of this title, or who shall, by word, circular, letter, or advertising, with intent to defraud in any manner, deceive, mislead, or threaten any applicant or prospective applicant, or other person having immediate or prospective business before the Office.  The reasons for any such suspension or exclusion shall be duly recorded.  The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, under such conditions and upon such proceedings as it by its rules determines, may review the action of the Commissioner upon the petition of the person so refused recognition or so suspended or excluded.


2
 An even worse scenario is a section 32 case, based on Dubost's attorney's action, preceding Dubost.    If appellate jurisdiction of the section 32 case was not solely in the Federal Circuit, there would be a substantial risk of having this circuit deciding a patent question arising under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 111, with possible preclusive effect on the issue in Dubost


3
 Both parties rely on Enders v. American Patent Search Co., 535 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir.1976), a case decided before the issuance of the Federal Circuit decisions construing 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338 jurisdiction.    Enders was a private action brought against persons alleged to be holding themselves out as recognized to practice before the patent office when in fact they were not so recognized.  Enders claimed a private right of action under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 33 (1982), a statute making it a crime falsely to hold oneself out as registered to practice patent law.  The Ninth Circuit held that a violation of 35 U.S.C. Sec. 33 did not have a strong enough relationship to patents to provide jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338
Arguably, Enders is distinguishable both on its facts, and because it involved a private cause of action under section 33, as opposed to the review of an action of the PTO.  However, it is unnecessary for us to attempt to reconcile our decision with the decision in Enders.    On the facts before us, we have no serious doubt about the correct result.  Furthermore, Enders is of only limited value because the decision was rendered before the creation of the Federal Circuit;  the Ninth Circuit, therefore, did not have occasion to consider the congressional policy of uniformity in the area of patent law, a matter of critical importance in our judgment in this case.

Abstract:  A loudspeaker enclosure has a loudspeaker driver mounted on a surface of the enclosure such that the driver has an exposed front face to produce sound waves which are sought to be transmitted to a listening space exterior of the loudspeaker enclosure. A plurality of successive spaced limp or semi-limp non-porous pliable barriers are positioned in an opening between the interior and exterior spaces of the enclosure so as to relieve rear pressure of the loudspeaker driver while attenuating the rear sound waves and providing a damping effect on the loudspeaker driver.
