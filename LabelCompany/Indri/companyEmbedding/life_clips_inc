Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Press Release, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by Life Clips and its projections of the future, about which it cannot be certain. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those discussed in "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Life Clips' annual report on Form 10-Q and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well as matters discussed in Life Clips' financial statements and related notes and other filings with the SEC, which may cause its actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Signs Distribution Agreement to Market and Sell Mobeego Products in Thailand and TaiwanMarketwiredMay 18, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareAVENTURA, FLORIDA--(Marketwired - May 18, 2017) -  Life Clips, Inc. (LCLP) (the "Company") a designer and seller of mobile accessories, and provider of global sourcing and sales and marketing services, announced today that it has entered into an exclusive one-year contract with a Taipei based distributor of off grid inverters (the "Distributor") to sell Mobeego products in Thailand and Taiwan. The contract grants the Distributor the non-transferable right to promote market and resell Mobeego products and will be automatically renewed for one additional year, provided the Distributor has performed all of its commitments and obligations. The terms of the contract require the Distributor to pay 50% of each accepted order in advance and 50% on delivery. The terms of the agreement also provides the Distributor certain named accounts in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. The Distributor has forecasted sales of 210,000 units over the next four quarters.In Thailand, a survey conducted by Nielsen Informate Mobile Insights has revealed that the average Thai spends 160 minutes on their mobile phone every day. According to the study, data consumption among smartphone users in Thailand is almost 60 percent higher than in other countries in the region. Thai smartphone users spend more time streaming video content and music to their devices than users in neighboring countries. There is also tremendous demand for social media, news and mobile gaming. In our April 24, 2017 press release, we referenced an October 3, 2016 report published by Allied Market Research projecting the global mobile phone accessories market is expected to reach $107.3 billion by 2022. According to the Allied report, the Asia-Pacific market will account for the majority of the revenue growth. The report also states a "rise in disposable income, proliferation of e-commerce websites, digitization of infrastructure with increased spending capacity of consumers, availability of low-cost products, and changing lifestyle pattern offer lucrative opportunities that fuel the market growth in this region."Huey Long, Life Clips President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Mobeego is an affordable cordless battery that provides an instant, single-use shot of power for smartphones. Our goal is to provide our customers with the ability to stay mobile and connected whenever and wherever they go." Mr. Long continued, "Unlike cumbersome chargers with a cord, Mobeego is small, lightweight, cordless and has a shelf life of 10 years. Once you have used it up, the Mobeego battery can be recycled, disposed of and replaced."Safe Harbor StatementIn addition to statements of current and historical fact, this Press Release contains forward-looking statements.

All distribution agreements call for minimum quarterly quotas. There is a risk that the distributor will not meet these quarterly quotas. In the event the quotas are not met the agreements are in breech which could void the agreement.

Life Clips, Inc. (LCLP) Announces Batteryfly Energy’s Mobeego product has won a package design award




















May 09, 2016 08:30 ET

CHARLOTTE, N.C., May  09, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Life Clips, Inc. (LCLP), an innovative brand of products revolutionizing the way people capture, manage, enjoy, and share life's moments, announced today that Batteryfly Energy’s Mobeego product has won a package design award.  Life Clips has signed a binding LOI to purchase Batteryfly Energy, Ltd. The sale is anticipated to close this quarter. The innovative disposable one time use Mobeego battery received an “Honorable Mention” in the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2016. Participants from 57 nations had registered about 5,200 products and innovations for the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2016. Only products that impress the jury with a well-thought-out detail solution receive the “Honorable Mention”. Mobeego™ is an instantly available, affordable and last-minute solution that does not require any pre-charging nor the use of cumbersome cords. The intimate, compact design of the reusable adaptor is meant for easy storage and accessibility to fit into your lifestyle immediately. It is an instant shot of power for your phone, so you can stay mobile whenever and wherever. With 41 experts from all around the world, who are chosen according to strict rules, the Red Dot Award: Product Design guarantees a very high judging competence: Only freelance designers, design professors and specialised journalists – but not designers employed at companies potentially participating – are appointed to the jury. The independent expert panel assesses each entry strictly and fairly, live and on site, according to criteria such as degree of innovation, formal quality, functionality and ecological compatibility. Professor Dr. Peter Zec, founder and president of the Red Dot Award: “With their performances, the Red Dot winners not only demonstrated an extraordinary design quality, but they also showed that design is an integral part of innovative product solutions.” 4 July 2016 marks the culmination of the Red Dot Award: Product Design 2016. During the glamorous awards ceremony, the Red Dot: Best of the Best laureates will accept their trophies in front of around 1,200 guests. At the subsequent after-show party “Designers’ Night”, the winners will receive their certificates and celebrate until the early hours in the Red Dot Design Museum Essen in the midst of prize-winning products. All award-winning products will be presented in the special exhibition “Design on Stage” for four weeks, before becoming part of the permanent exhibition. With about 2,000 exhibits from 45 nations, the Red Dot Design Museum Essen displays the complete range of current product design. In the former boiler house of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Zollverein coal mine, it presents products that have won the Red Dot on five floors and approximately 4,000 square meters. Every year, the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary design informs around 150,000 visitors about current trends and top achievements. About the Red Dot Design Award: In order to appraise the wide scope of design in a professional manner, the Red Dot Design Award is broken down into the three distinct disciplines: the Red Dot Award: Product Design, Red Dot Award: Communication Design and Red Dot Award: Design Concept. The Red Dot Award is organized by the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen in Essen, Germany. With more than 17,000 entries in 2015 alone, it is one of the largest competitions in the world. It was in 1955 that a jury convened for the first time to assess the best designs of the day. The name and brand of the award were developed in the 1990s by Red Dot CEO, Professor Dr. Peter Zec. Since then the sought-after “Red Dot” is the revered international seal of outstanding design quality. Further information: www.red-dot.org.

The contract grants the Distributor the non-transferable right to promote market and resell Mobeego products and will be automatically renewed for one additional year, provided the Distributor has performed all of its commitments and obligations. The terms of the contract require the Distributor to pay 50% of each accepted order in advance and 50% on delivery. The terms of the agreement also provides the Distributor certain named accounts in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. The Distributor has forecasted sales of 210,000 units over the next four quarters. 
In Thailand, a survey conducted by Nielsen Informate Mobile Insights has revealed that the average Thai spends 160 minutes on their mobile phone every day. According to the study, data consumption among smartphone users in Thailand is almost 60 percent higher than in other countries in the region. Thai smartphone users spend more time streaming video content and music to their devices than users in neighboring countries. There is also tremendous demand for social media, news and mobile gaming. In our April 24, 2017 press release, we referenced an October 3, 2016 report published by Allied Market Research projecting the global mobile phone accessories market is expected to reach $107.3 billion by 2022. According to the Allied report, the Asia-Pacific market will account for the majority of the revenue growth. The report also states a "rise in disposable income, proliferation of e-commerce websites, digitization of infrastructure with increased spending capacity of consumers, availability of low-cost products, and changing lifestyle pattern offer lucrative opportunities that fuel the market growth in this region."
Huey Long, Life Clips President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Mobeego is an affordable cordless battery that provides an instant, single-use shot of power for smartphones. Our goal is to provide our customers with the ability to stay mobile and connected whenever and wherever they go." Mr. Long continued, "Unlike cumbersome chargers with a cord, Mobeego is small, lightweight, cordless and has a shelf life of 10 years. Once you have used it up, the Mobeego battery can be recycled, disposed of and replaced."

The words "forecast," "will," "intend," "anticipate," "project," "intend," "expect," "should," "believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Press Release, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by Life Clips and its projections of the future, about which it cannot be certain. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those discussed in "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Life Clips' annual report on Form 10-Q and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well as matters discussed in Life Clips' financial statements and related notes and other filings with the SEC, which may cause its actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

All distribution agreements call for minimum quarterly quotas. There is a risk that the distributor will not meet these quarterly quotas. In the event the quotas are not met the agreements are in breech which could void the agreement. Therefore the dollar volumes may not be attained.

Life Clips, Inc. CEO Issues Shareholder Update




















May 17, 2016 09:58 ET

 | Source: Life Clips, Inc.






CHARLOTTE, N.C., May  17, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Life Clips, Inc. (LCLP), an innovative brand of products revolutionizing the way people capture, manage, enjoy, and share life's moments, issues the following shareholder update from CEO Bob Gruder. Dear Shareholders, I would first like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support and interest in Life Clips, Inc. This is truly an exciting time for the Company as we continue with our mission of bringing innovative tech products to market on a global scale. I am happy to share that, to date, everything is moving forward as planned and I couldn’t be happier with the developments unfolding around our SoloVu™4k action camera and progression of the Batteryfly Energy LTD. acquisition. Many months of hard work were put into developing the App, camera design, and features of the SoloVu™4k to be competitive and seek acquisitions in a rapidly growing marketplace. Our SoloVu™4k has several key features that competitors like GoPro do not come standard with, such as; an internal gyroscope for greater image stabilization, built in motion detection for activation, and a 12 mega-pixel image camera. The SoloVu™4k will retail for $159.00, significantly less than the leading brand. After months of hard work and preparation, it is now time to hit the market hard with the official launch of our SoloVu™4k action camera. Big box retailers are our primary target and all necessary steps are being taken to ensure attractive distribution. When compared to existing features and prices of action cameras on the market, I am confident consumers will love the SoloVu™4k. Moving onto the highly anticipated Batteryfly Energy LTD. acquisition. Completion of this acquisition would add the Mobeego product line to our portfolio and complement our SoloVu™4k action camera perfectly. Mobeego is a disposable battery is a one-time charger for instant mobile use. Mobeego eliminates the need to find the closest outlet to charge your phone, and you no longer need to stop using your phone to save the battery. Mobeego batteries have a 10 year shelf-life and do not require a charging cord or any pre-charge. I am excited to say that Life Clips has been able to raise all necessary capital to close on the Batteryfly Energy acquisition through private transactions from existing shareholders. I anticipate closing on the acquisition in the very near future. It is my goal to complete this acquisition and bring both the SoloVu™4k and Mobeego products to market while protecting shareholder value. I believe that by raising capital internally through existing shareholders with similar long-term goals as myself, does just that. With the many months of hard work and preparation behind us, it’s time to bring these innovative technology products to market. Shareholders would be excited to know that discussions for big box retail distribution are already underway. I look forward to updating the investment community on these developments and many more still to come. Thank you again for your continued support of Life Clips, Inc.
