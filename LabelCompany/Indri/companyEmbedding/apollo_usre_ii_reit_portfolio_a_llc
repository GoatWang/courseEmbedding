Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. to Acquire Apollo 
      Residential Mortgage, Inc.




Transaction Value Represents a Significant Premium to AMTG’s 
      Common Stock Price


Transaction Expected to be Accretive to ARI’s Book Value Per Share 
      of Common Stock






February 26, 2016 08:15 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (“ARI”) (NYSE:ARI) and 
      Apollo Residential Mortgage, Inc. (“AMTG”) (NYSE:AMTG) today announced 
      the signing of a definitive merger agreement (the “Agreement”) under 
      which ARI will acquire AMTG for consideration to be paid in cash and 
      shares of ARI common stock, which would value AMTG at approximately 
      $14.59 per share of common stock based upon the closing price of ARI’s 
      shares of common stock on February 25, 2016 and assuming AMTG’s book 
      value per share of common stock on December 31, 2015. The value of the 
      consideration represents a premium of approximately 44% to the closing 
      price of AMTG’s shares of common stock as of February 25, 2016.
    

      In this transaction, AMTG stockholders will receive approximately 0.417 
      ARI shares of common stock per AMTG share of common stock and 
      approximately $7.53 per share in cash, based upon AMTG’s book value per 
      share of common stock on December 31, 2015 of $16.40. The cash portion 
      of the consideration, and thus the total purchase price, is subject to 
      adjustment based upon fluctuations in AMTG’s book value. The adjustment 
      will be based upon 89.25% of any change in AMTG’s book value between 
      December 31, 2015 and a future determination date prior to the mailing 
      of the definitive proxy statement to AMTG stockholders with respect to 
      the transaction. In aggregate, based upon the closing price of ARI’s 
      shares of common stock on February 25, 2016 and assuming AMTG’s book 
      value per share of common stock on December 31, 2015, the transaction 
      values AMTG at approximately $641 million, including ARI’s assumption of 
      $172.5 million of AMTG’s 8.0% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual 
      Preferred Stock (the “8.0% Preferred Stock”). The book value based 
      adjustment mechanism described above, which is uncapped, could result in 
      a lower or higher valuation.
    

      It is expected that the transaction will be accretive to ARI’s book 
      value per share of common stock in 2016.
    

      The transaction has been approved by the board of directors of each 
      company upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of 
      independent directors of each board of directors. The transaction will 
      be subject to approval by the holders of at least a majority of (i) the 
      outstanding common shares of AMTG and (ii) the outstanding common shares 
      of AMTG that are beneficially owned by persons unaffiliated with Apollo 
      Global Management, LLC (“Apollo”).
    

      As of December 31, 2015, AMTG’s portfolio of Agency and non-Agency 
      Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (“RMBS”), residential mortgage 
      loans and other investments totaled approximately $3.4 billion.
    

      Thomas D. Christopoul, Chairman of the special committee of AMTG’s board 
      of directors, said: “The residential mortgage REIT sector has faced 
      significant headwinds over the past several quarters. As a result, 
      AMTG’s board of directors has undergone a process to review strategic 
      alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Following this review and 
      working with our independent financial and legal advisors, we are 
      pleased to have reached a definitive agreement with ARI that we believe 
      serves the best interests of our stockholders. This transaction offers 
      AMTG stockholders an opportunity to receive a significant premium to the 
      recent and current trading value of the common stock and, importantly, 
      an opportunity to participate in ARI’s future growth through ownership 
      of ARI common stock. We believe the transaction will provide an 
      excellent outcome for AMTG stockholders and is the alternative that will 
      offer the most attractive value.”
    

      Jeffrey M. Gault, Chairman of the board of directors of ARI and Chairman 
      of ARI’s special committee of the board of directors, said: “ARI’s 
      accretive acquisition of AMTG will enable both companies’ stockholders 
      to participate in ARI’s future growth. As we indicated on our earnings 
      call a few weeks ago, ARI continues to see compelling investment 
      opportunities in our core commercial real estate lending business. Upon 
      successful closure of the AMTG transaction, ARI intends to redeploy the 
      capital from the transaction to fund ARI’s current investment pipeline 
      and pursue attractive new commercial real estate debt opportunities 
      expected to drive earnings growth. We are confident that this 
      transaction will significantly enhance ARI’s ability to build long-term 
      stockholder value.”
    

Transaction Highlights


      The proposed transaction presents several compelling benefits to the 
      stockholders of both companies.
    

Benefits to AMTG Stockholders



Significant premium to AMTG’s common stock price – The value of 
        the consideration represents a premium of approximately 44% to the 
        closing price of AMTG’s shares of common stock as of February 25, 
        2016, assuming AMTG’s book value per share of common stock on December 
        31, 2015 and ARI’s closing stock price on February 25, 2016.
      

Enhanced trading liquidity and attractive dividend yield – In 
        connection with the transaction, AMTG’s common stockholders will 
        receive 13.4 million shares of ARI common stock in the aggregate. Over 
        the past twelve months, ARI’s trading volume has been approximately 
        $9.2 million per day versus approximately $3.5 million per day for 
        AMTG. In addition, for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, ARI paid a 
        quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share of common stock, which 
        represents a 10.9% annualized dividend yield based upon ARI’s closing 
        price of $16.93 on February 25, 2016.
      

Ability to participate in ongoing growth of ARI’s business – 
        Through the ownership of ARI shares of common stock, AMTG stockholders 
        will have the opportunity to participate in ARI’s ongoing growth and 
        success, which is expected to be enhanced through this transaction. At 
        December 31, 2015, ARI’s investment portfolio totaled approximately 
        $2.5 billion and the company’s market capitalization totaled 
        approximately $1.4 billion.
      


Benefits to ARI Stockholders



Ability to expand the balance sheet in a cost effective and 
        accretive manner at a time when ARI’s management believes there is 
        significant opportunity to deploy capital into commercial real estate 
        debt investments at attractive returns


            In connection with the transaction, ARI will issue 13.4 million 
            shares at $16.75 per share of common stock. This transaction 
            allows ARI to issue common stock at a premium to ARI’s book value 
            per share of common stock at December 31, 2015, without taking 
            market risk or paying an underwriting fee.
          

            ARI also will assume $172.5 million of AMTG’s 8.0% Preferred 
            Stock, which ARI’s management believes is an attractive rate that 
            would be difficult to replicate in the current market environment.
          

            Over time, ARI intends to re-deploy the capital from the 
            transaction into ARI’s target assets. ARI has a robust pipeline of 
            commercial real estate debt investments with attractive 
            risk-adjusted returns in which to invest the incremental capital 
            from the acquisition, in addition to $86 million of fundings for 
            previously closed transactions that are scheduled throughout 2016. 
            ARI does not intend to enter the residential mortgage investment 
            business.
          



Agreement with Athene for financing, future sale of select assets 
        and stock liquidity – In connection with the transaction, ARI has 
        entered into an agreement with certain subsidiaries of Athene Holding 
        Ltd. (“Athene”), an insurance holding company whose operating 
        subsidiaries’ business is primarily issuing and reinsuring retirement 
        savings products, to sell approximately $1.2 billion of primarily 
        non-Agency RMBS securities, subject to increase or decrease in certain 
        circumstances, at a price to be set (based upon a pre-agreed 
        methodology) prior to the date that the proxy statement for the 
        transaction is first mailed to AMTG stockholders. In addition, a 
        subsidiary of Athene will provide a short-term $200 million credit 
        facility to ARI to finance the cash portion of the merger 
        consideration, which is required to be repaid with the proceeds of the 
        sale to Athene’s subsidiaries of such RMBS securities. Finally, a 
        subsidiary of Athene has committed to acquire up to $20 million of ARI 
        shares of common stock if ARI’s common stock price falls below the per 
        share price at which such shares are issued to AMTG stockholders 
        during the 30 trading days following the closing of the acquisition, 
        which is expected to provide for additional liquidity to ARI 
        stockholders. Each of these transactions is subject to certain closing 
        conditions.
      


Additional Details


      Under the terms of the Agreement, AMTG may solicit, receive, evaluate 
      and enter into negotiations with respect to alternative proposals from 
      third parties for a period of 35 calendar days, continuing through April 
      1, 2016. The special committee of the board of directors of AMTG, with 
      the assistance of its independent advisors, will actively solicit 
      alternative proposals during this period. There can be no assurance that 
      this process will result in receipt of a superior offer or that any 
      other transactions may be approved or consummated.
    

      AMTG stockholders will receive an ordinary course dividend per share of 
      common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, subject to the 
      approval of the AMTG board of directors.
    

      Completion of the transaction, which is expected in either the second or 
      third quarter of 2016, is subject to, among other things, the approval 
      by the holders of at least a majority of (i) the outstanding common 
      shares of AMTG and (ii) the outstanding common shares of AMTG that are 
      beneficially owned by persons unaffiliated with Apollo, as well as 
      obtaining customary regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of 
      customary closing conditions.

Apollo Global Management Announces Strategic Transactions




Creation of AR Global More Than Doubles Apollo’s Real Estate AUM, 
      Increases Permanent Capital, Expands Investor Base, Provides Significant 
      Growth Opportunities and Diversifies Investment Offerings


Acquisition of RCS Capital’s Wholesale Distribution Business and 
      Strategic Relationship with Cetera Enhances Apollo’s Retail Distribution 
      Capabilities






August 06, 2015 02:06 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) (together with its consolidated 
      subsidiaries, “Apollo”) today announced that it has agreed to acquire a 
      majority interest in a new company, AR Global Investments, LLC (“AR 
      Global”), that will own a majority of the ongoing asset management 
      business of AR Capital, a leading asset management firm focused on 
      providing income solutions for retail investors. Apollo also announced 
      today that it is acquiring RCS Capital’s (“RCS”) (NYSE: RCAP) wholesale 
      distribution business, which will become part of AR Global, and that it 
      has entered into a strategic relationship with RCS Capital’s retail 
      advice business, Cetera Financial Group (“Cetera”).
    

      AR Global will more than double Apollo’s real estate assets under 
      management (“AUM”) to approximately $27 billion. After giving effect to 
      the transaction, the capital managed by Apollo in permanent capital 
      vehicles will increase to approximately $95 billion, representing a 
      majority of Apollo’s $182 billion in total AUM1. In addition, 
      the transaction is expected to diversify Apollo’s investor base, augment 
      the firm’s strategically important retail distribution activities, and 
      provide significant growth opportunities through the expansion of AR 
      Capital’s existing businesses.
    

      AR Capital has built a sector-leading asset management platform that 
      provides yield-oriented funds to the retail clients of its wealth 
      management partners, primarily in the independent broker-dealer channel. 
      AR Capital has broadened its focus in real estate strategies spanning 
      net lease, healthcare, retail, office, and hospitality properties. More 
      recently, AR Capital has successfully expanded into yield-focused credit 
      strategies such as commercial real estate debt, corporate credit and 
      structured credit all of which will be complementary to Apollo’s 
      existing investment strategies in those areas. In addition to the market 
      opportunity for expansion of AR Capital’s existing investment 
      strategies, AR Global has the potential to become a growth platform for 
      launching innovative new investment strategies that will meet the 
      growing secular demand by individual investors for both current income 
      needs as well as increased allocation of their portfolios to alternative 
      strategies.
    

      “We believe AR Global will be well-positioned to benefit from the 
      growing trend among retail investors to seek yield-oriented investment 
      solutions and at the same time drive meaningful growth for Apollo. We 
      are very excited about the transaction we have structured, and believe 
      it has the potential to create significant value for Apollo’s 
      shareholders over time with a substantial portion of the transaction 
      consideration tied to future growth and product diversification,” said 
      Marc Rowan, Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director of Apollo. “AR 
      Capital participates in a sector that is in a state of transition due to 
      both changing regulations and the evolving needs of investors. Apollo’s 
      contrarian approach embraces businesses and industries that are in the 
      midst of change, which we believe creates attractive opportunities. We 
      believe Apollo is well positioned to continue to play a positive role in 
      helping the industry evolve to offer more institutional-quality products 
      and services to individual investors and their financial advisors. 
      Apollo has proven experience in managing assets for the world’s leading 
      institutional investors and wealth management platforms, which we 
      believe positions the firm well to provide enhanced efficiency and 
      transparency to the retail investment community.”
    

      The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to Apollo’s fiscal 
      year 2016 Economic Net Income and Distributable Earnings, and Apollo 
      believes it will add meaningfully to the firm’s long-term growth, while 
      continuing to diversify the firm’s AUM and distribution channels. The 
      transaction is structured to include $378 million of consideration 
      upfront, split between $200 million of cash and $178 million of Apollo 
      equity, plus future performance-related contingent consideration. This 
      structure is intended to facilitate a smooth transition of the business 
      and its personnel in the near-term while also creating mutual long-term 
      alignment of interests. The transaction is expected to close in the next 
      60 days, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions.
    

      AR Global will be governed by a newly created board of directors 
      consisting of six Apollo representatives, one of whom will be appointed 
      Chairman, including co-founders Josh Harris and Marc Rowan, Anthony 
      Civale (Lead Partner and Chief Operating Officer of Apollo’s Credit 
      business), Stephanie Drescher (Global Head of Business Development & 
      Investor Relationship Management), Martin Kelly (Chief Financial 
      Officer) and John Suydam (Chief Legal Officer). The four partners of AR 
      Capital (Peter Budko, William Kahane, Nicholas Schorsch and Michael 
      Weil) will also serve on the board. William Kahane, AR Capital’s 
      Co-Founder and head of real estate investments, will serve as Chief 
      Executive Officer of AR Global until a search is concluded to hire a new 
      Chief Executive Officer after which he will serve as Chief Investment 
      Officer of AR Global’s real estate activities. Nicholas Schorsch will 
      serve as Senior Managing Director of AR Global. AR Global will benefit 
      from the bench of talented investment professionals and managers within 
      each of its existing investment strategies. This team has generated 
      strong performance in the aggregate in vehicles that began as non-traded 
      public REITs and were subsequently listed or exited, generating 
      attractive returns of approximately 17% net of fees.2


      AR Capital, founded in 2006, currently manages approximately $19 billion 
      of alternative assets across a variety of real estate investment trusts, 
      business development companies, mutual funds and other partnerships. 
      Since its founding, AR Capital has had a history of growth and 
      innovation and has been a pioneer in the retail alternative investment 
      space.
    

      Apollo also announced today that it has agreed to acquire RCS Capital’s 
      wholesale distribution business for $25 million in cash3. 
      Apollo has also entered into a strategic partnership with RCS’s retail 
      advice business, Cetera Financial Group. In addition, Apollo will be 
      purchasing $25 million in newly issued preferred stock in RCS. The 
      wholesale business and partnership with Cetera are complementary to 
      Apollo’s existing relationships and long-term commitment to the retail 
      channel. The transaction will substantially expand Apollo’s wholesale 
      distribution network, adding scale and an increased ability to service 
      the needs of its strategic distribution partners as appropriate. The 
      acquisition is expected to close concurrently with Apollo’s acquisition 
      of AR Global, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing 
      conditions. Bill Dwyer, the Chief Executive Officer of RCS’s wholesale 
      business, will continue to lead the business following the acquisition.
    

      “RCS’s wholesale distribution business is one of the industry’s largest 
      networks for distributing alternative investment products, and we 
      believe it will play a strategically important role in expanding and 
      diversifying Apollo’s and AR Global’s real estate and credit 
      businesses,” commented Apollo’s Marc Rowan. “In addition, we believe our 
      strategic partnership with Cetera, a leading network of independent 
      financial advisors, will be beneficial to Apollo by adding scale and 
      greater diversification, particularly from the independent broker dealer 
      community.”
    

      Lazard acted as financial advisor to Apollo and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP 
      acted as legal counsel.

      In this press release, references to “Apollo,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the 
      “Company” refer collectively to Apollo Global Management, LLC, together 
      with its consolidated subsidiaries. This press release may contain 
      forward looking statements that are within the meaning of Section 27A of 
      the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include, 
      but are not limited to, discussions related to Apollo's expectations 
      regarding the performance of its business, its liquidity and capital 
      resources and the other non-historical statements in the discussion and 
      analysis. These forward-looking statements are based on management's 
      beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently 
      available to, management. When used in this press release, the words 
      “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
      Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these 
      forward looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that 
      these expectations will prove to have been correct. These statements are 
      subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including risks 
      relating to our dependence on certain key personnel, our ability to 
      raise new private equity, credit or real estate funds, market 
      conditions, generally, our ability to manage our growth, fund 
      performance, changes in our regulatory environment and tax status, the 
      variability of our revenues, net income and cash flow, our use of 
      leverage to finance our businesses and investments by our funds and 
      litigation risks, among others. We believe these factors include but are 
      not limited to those described under the section entitled “Risk Factors” 
      in Apollo's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 27, 2015, as such factors 
      may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, 
      which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
      These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read 
      in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in 
      this press release and in other filings. We undertake no obligation to 
      publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as 
      required by applicable law. This press release does not constitute an 
      offer of any Apollo fund.
