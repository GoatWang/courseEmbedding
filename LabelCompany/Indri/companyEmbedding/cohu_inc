Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Cohu Has A Compelling Turnaround Growth Story That You Need To Know - Cohu, Inc. (NASDAQ:COHU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cohu Has A Compelling Turnaround Growth Story That You Need To KnowJul.20.17 | About: Cohu, Inc. (COHU) Shark Traders Long/short equity, momentum, short-term horizon, bondssharktraders.comSummaryCohu's recent financial performance, especially improving gross profit margin, makes us optimistic.The company's Malaysian operation is the main catalyst behind recent improvements in its margin, which is likely to help scale net income if sales growth continues.There are several upcoming products in Cohu's pipeline that would help the company continue the top line growth in coming quarters.It has a price target of $25 per share that offers secondary investors an upside potential of around 27.1% in the coming quarters.Since B. Riley reiterated a Buy rating on Cohu Inc. (NASDAQ:COHU) on July 10, the stock price has increased from $16.32 per share, and it is currently trading at $19.67 per share, representing an increase of 20.53% over the last ten-day period. After analyzing the company's recent financial performance in the last few quarters, we believe management has gotten its act together and found a way to improve its internal efficiency. Given that several new products are in the pipeline that would help the company to increase sales in the coming quarters, we believe Cohu's top line growth momentum would likely to be sustainable. We believe the stock price got the leg to climb further north, as based on the current price target of $25.00 per share, it appears undervalued at the current price level. We remain optimistic about Cohu's secular growth story and recommend that secondary investors increase their exposure to this company. Cohu's Recent Financial Performance Makes Us Optimistic 

 Figure 1: Cohu Inc.'s Stagnant Revenue Period Appears to Have Ended Over the last five years, Cohu's revenue curve has had wild swings. At the end of 2014, its quarterly revenue was above $90 million, which drastically reduced to below $65 million by the end of Q1 2015. Since then, Cohu's management has struggled to deliver the growth, which it was able to deliver during 2014 that pushed the top line from $45 million at the end of Q4 2013 to over $90 million - a 100% increase - by the end of Q4 2014.
 Since Q1 2015, Cohu's revenue ranged between around $65 million to $75 million only. However, in Q1 2017, revenue came out at $81.01 million, the highest in the last two years and 23.29% higher compared to $65.78 million in Q1 2016. 

 Figure 2: Cohu Inc.'s Management Was Able to Increase Q1 2017 Gross Profit Margin to 39.77% While we are optimistic about the company's top line performance, it is worth mentioning that it also managed to increase its gross profit margin for the first time in the last 5-year period, which came out at 39.77% in Q1 2017. 

 Figure 3: Cohu Inc.'s Improved Gross Profit Margin Helped The Company Post a $6.76 Million Net Income in Q1 2017 As a result, it was able to deliver a $6.76 million net income in Q1 2017, which was considerably higher compared to the -$1.69 net loss in the same quarter last year. 

 Figure 4: Cohu Inc.'s Profit Margin Has Surged to 2014 Level in Q1 2017 We also found an interesting fact about the latest financial performance of the company regarding its net profit margin. Cohu's quarterly revenue has yet to reach above $90 million, as it was at the end of 2014. However, because of the improving internal efficiency that helped the company post a 39.77% gross profit margin in Q1 2017, its Q1 2017 net profit margin also increased to 8.34%, which is almost at the same level as in Q3 2014.
 We believe Cohu's management is on the right track to turn things around, and if it can keep up the top line growth in the coming quarters, its net income would likely follow, as it has in Q1 2017. Conclusion During the Q1 2017 earnings call, Luis Müller, the president and chief executive officer of Cohu, mentioned that the company's Malaysian operation was responsible for over 90% of all handlers in Q1. We believe the low cost of operation in Malaysia was one of the catalysts behind its improved gross profit margin during the first quarter of 2017 that helped the company post a $6.76 million net income. Furthermore, we also learned their Cohu's test cell utilization rate across the installed base was 86% during Q1, and we believe this acts as a signal to investors that the company's internal efficiency is on the rise. There are several major products under review at the moment that will help Cohu continue to enjoy the top line growth momentum. Especially, the new wafer-level CSP prober is on the verge of completion, and the company plans to ship multiple systems from the second quarter onwards. In addition, the orders were up by around 16% with its newly acquired Kita operation that makes us optimistic about the continuation of the company's top line growth. As we mentioned earlier, Cohu's management seems to have found a way to leverage the company's Malaysian operation to improve margins, and sales growth would likely scale its bottom line in the coming quarters. Currently, Cohu has a price target of $25.00 per share, and based on the current stock price of $19.67 per share, it offers secondary investors an additional 27.1% upside potential in the coming quarters. Therefore, we recommend that secondary investors consider increasing their exposure to Cohu.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
