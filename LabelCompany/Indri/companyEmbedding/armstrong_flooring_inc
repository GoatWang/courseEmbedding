Luxe Plank Flooring







 Built to Last  




Luxe Plank is made up of three primary layers. On top is a protective wear layer made of an enhanced urethane that makes it
                                    easy to clean and resistant to scratches and scuffs. There is also a protective clear film layer that adds durability and
                                    helps protect against rips, tears and gouges. On the printed design layer, the visuals are very realistic natural wood planks.
                                    The bottom-most layer is the tile backing, adding structural strength and durability.
                                 
Luxe Plank™ vinyl wood plank flooring allows you to take the look of natural hardwood to places you never thought possible.

Lifestyle





 Room  




The wonderful combination of design options, easy installation and good value make luxury vinyl tile a flooring favorite for
                                    utility areas, kitchens, mudrooms, bathrooms and playrooms. Luxury vinyl is not meant for stairs, but for any and all flat,
                                    level surfaces.

 Kids and Durability  




People love the fact that luxury vinyl feels warmer and softer underfoot than other hard-surface flooring, like ceramic tile.
                                    It’s a friendly surface for normal household use: crawling babies, dropped dishes, flying toys and spilled sippy cups.
                                 







 Pets  




“Hard surface floors are best for pet parents because carpet absorbs odors and catches fur and dust. Alterna is not only pet-friendly,
                                       it’s family friendly since it’s wear-water-and-stain resistant. It’s also easy to clean.”
Wendy DiamondPet Lifestyle Expert
                                 







 Warranty  




Alterna™ tile has a lifetime warranty. Luxe Plank™ warranties vary from 10 years to lifetime for residential use, depending
                                    on product selected.

Budget





 Product Cost  




Luxury vinyl is typically priced from $2.00 to $7.00 per square foot.







 Color and Wear Layers  




The color and design of luxury vinyl can affect pricing. At the mid to high levels, look for tiles and planks that are embossed-in-register
                                    (EIR), meaning that the look and feel matches the grain and pattern of the real thing. Thicker wear and better warranties
                                    also add to the price of flooring. Your retailer can help ensure you understand your choices.
                                 







 DIY or Professional Installation  




If you plan to install luxury vinyl flooring yourself to save installation charges, Armstrong has three great options: Luxe
                                    Plank with Lynx Technology™, Luxe Plank with FasTak™, and Vivero luxury flooring. Luxe Plank products have pressure-sensitive
                                    adhesive strips that allow the planks to attach together or to be applied directly to the floor.
                                 
DIYers will love Vivero flooring’s IntegriLock™ System, which allows for a quick, clean installation with minimal prep work.
                                    IntegriLock features the innovative Välinge 5G lock.
                                 
Alterna™ tile is usually professionally installed. Costs can vary, based on geography (labor rates), subfloor preparation
                                    and whether you choose a grouted or non-grouted installation. Armstrong recommends contacting an Armstrong Certified Installer
                                    to get an accurate installation cost estimate.
                                 







 Floor Removal  




Don’t forget to factor-in the cost of getting rid of your old floor. Depending upon where you live, what type of floor you
                                    are removing, and your installer, budget around $2.00 per square foot to have it removed and hauled away.
                                 














Installation





 Luxe Plank LVT Installation Options  




Luxe Plank™ LVT can be installed anywhere in the home, above or below ground, either as a floating floor or one that bonds
                                    directly to the subfloor. Luxe Plank installs over most existing flooring with ease. It’s also the perfect floor if you’re
                                    interested in a DIY project.
                                 
Alterna Installation Options
Alterna™ tile can be installed almost anywhere in the home using our S-288 adhesive. Professional installation is highly recommended
                                    for this product because of the complexity of gluing and grouting the tiles.
                                 
Luxury Vinyl DIY Installation







 Vivero Luxury Flooring Installation Options  




Vivero luxury flooring has three different installation methods: traditional glue-down, simple angle locking technology, and
                                    the new IntegriLock™ System*, the first locking system of its kind for luxury vinyl. This premium locking system, produced
                                    under license from Välinge Innovation, installs simply and securely over almost any subfloor. No glue or adhesive is required.
                                 
*Produced under license from Välinge Innovation.







 Installation Considerations  




Read the installation instructions carefully. No matter what kind of luxury vinyl floor you choose, the subfloor surface must
                                    be prepped, so it’s smooth, flat, and dry. Any bump, ridge, or indentation in the subfloor may eventually show through on
                                    the surface of the vinyl floor. If you're installing directly over new concrete, test it for moisture and pH levels to ensure
                                    it has cured before installing luxury vinyl flooring.

Armstrong Luxe Rigid Core Luxury Vinyl Plank
Armstrong Luxe Rigid Core Specifications Features


Armstrong Luxe Rigid Core
 
Luxe Vinyl flooring with Rigid core technologies is 8 mm thick and the layers consist of 12 mil clear wear layer then the visual layer followed by the 1.7 mm LVT layer, 4.8 mm composite core and lastly, 1.5 mm natural cork back. Armstrong has also put the angle tap locking installation on this product which makes installation more simple. The real upside to this product is it’s waterproof, so putting it down in a kitchen or bathroom is never a problem. The acrylic top coating resists scratches, scuffs and wear and the cork bottom layer helps to reduce noise while offering insulation value. This products comes in four different designs, such as rustic, traditional, exotic and stone look. No matter you decor or taste you can find a color that will make any room look appealing, but natural at the same time. The Luxe vinyl is one of the thickest rigid core floors on the market today, giving you years of wear and tear. Why choose another vinyl floor when you can purchase an Armstrong and know you are making the right decision, because Armstrong stands behind everything they make.

Rubber Tile Installation:

First, clean your sub floor so it is free of all dirt, grease or debris.
Snap a chalk line on the sub floor 24” from one wall in your room. Snap another chalk line on the subfloor 24” from an adjacent wall. You should now have a pair of perpendicular lines making an approximate 90-degree angle.
Begin laying the interlocking tiles along the chalk lines, snapping the locks together as you go. Arrows are located on the back of your tiles, when installing the tiles all the arrows should be pointing in the same direction.
Leave the perimeter of the room open until the field is installed.
After the field is covered, go back and cut in tiles along the walls in the room. It is recommended to leave a gap along the wall roughly the thickness of the tiles being used to account for expansion and contraction of the floor in varied temperature ranges.

**Note: When piecing interlocking tiles together, adhesives are usually not used since the weight of the locked together product is usually enough to keep the floor tiles from moving. However, if you do experience movement and would like to ensure that the tiles do not slide at all, some double-sided tape or mat tape can be used around the perimeter of the installation to prevent any movement.

Rubber Tile Delivery
Rubber gym tiles are typically made to order material. Delivery method is determined by the weight of your purchase. If the total weight of the rubber tiles is 120 lbs or less, the order will go FedEx Ground. Otherwise the rubber roll may be shipped out on a freight truck. Freight delivery consist of 24 hour call prior to delivery. Don’t worry though - you will not be asked to take your new rubber roll off the truck. We cover the cost of lift-gate to curbside. Customer’s will be responsible for getting the rubber gym rolls in their new gym facility. For commercial gym owners, this can be great and new version of strength training!

Product Details



Application Tool:
putty knife


Dry Time:
2-6 hours, depending on size of area filled


Cleanup:
soap and water


Recommended Uses:
for filling cracks, small gouges, nail holes, knot holes and other defects in unfinished wood


Stain Application:
as soon as wood filler has dried and is sanded







Directions 
PREPARATION:
Surface must be clean, dry, and free of dirt, grease, oil and loose particles. For rotted wood use Minwax® Wood Hardener to strengthen wood fibers before applying Minwax® Stainable Wood Filler.This product should not be used on holes larger than 3/4". For larger holes use, Minwax® High Performance Wood Filler. 
APPLICATION:

Squeeze a liberal amount of Minwax® Stainable Wood Filler into the area to be filled and press firmly into place, using a putty knife. Fill slightly above surface to allow for sanding while minimizing overspreading on surrounding areas. Remove excess. 
Allow the filler to dry completely. Dry time will vary depending on depth of area to be filled. Most common shallow repairs will dry within 2 hours. For deeper holes, fill in layers 1/4" at a time, which may require 2-6 hours to dry. 
Sand filler smooth and flush to the wood. Remove all sanding residue before staining, topcoating or painting. 

CLEAN UP:Use soap and water to clean hands and tools before filler dries. 
STAINING AND FINISHING:
Before filling, test stain on scrap wood with filler. Choose a Minwax® penetrating stain, such as, Minwax® Wood Finish™, Minwax® Water-Based Stain or Minwax® Gel Stain and apply according to the label directions. After staining for interior use, apply a protective clear finish such as Minwax® Fast Drying Polyurethane or Minwax® Polycrylic® Protective Finish for long lasting beauty and protection. For exterior use, apply a protective finish such as Minwax® Helmsman® Spar Urethane. Minwax® Stainable Wood Filler can also be directly topcoated with a clear finish or painted. 
Note: Not recommended for use with Minwax® PolyShades® one-step stain and finish. Not recommended for use on floors. Store at room temperature. Keep from freezing. Do not apply when temperature is less than 40°F.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
