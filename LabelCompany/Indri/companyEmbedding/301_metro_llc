301 Metro, LLC 506(c) Offering Platform
Investment Opportunity
301 Metro, LLC (“301 Metro”) was formed for the purpose of aggregating investment capital and deploying that capital as a preferred equity investor in 3rd & M, LLC (“3rd & M”). Sponsored by The Bernstein Companies and affiliates, 3rd & M will develop and operate 187 Class A multifamily units (“301 M”) located in Washington D.C.’s burgeoning Southwest Waterfront submarket. The transit-oriented development is located steps from the Waterfront Metro Station, Arena Stage and the two billion dollar Wharf development that is transforming the waterfront. 
The Bernstein Companies (“TBC”) has been involved with the project since acquiring the neighboring buildings at 1001 and 1101 3rd Street SW, and the underlying land in a ground lease in 2004. Following purchase of the land from the District of Columbia in 2006, TBC began planning Phase I of the project, which involved a full renovation of the 1101 building and conversion of the project from apartment to condominiums, now known as Waterfront Tower. Waterfront Tower, which delivered late in 2009, won the Delta Associates award for Best Condo Conversion of 2010 and was sold out by early 2011. The commencement of 301 M Street, SW marks the second of three phases in the redevelopment of this historic I.M Pei site, and continues to breathe new life and opportunity into the Waterfront Metro Station area. 
301 M is a boutique 11-story development that was designed by Maurice Walters Architect and will feature 187 total luxury apartments, up to 111 underground parking spaces, 63 bike parking spaces, 23 storage units and amenities such as balconies, an outdoor rooftop lounge with 360° views of DC, a dog run and dog spa, a community room, a bike workroom, a fitness center and a street-level courtyard to unwind.







Millennials are drawn to transit-oriented development. Just steps from the metro and numerous bus stops, bike and car sharing stations – 301 M delivers.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
