CITIC Capital Partners has closed its third oversubscribed Japan buyout fund at a hard cap of JPY30 billion or $267 million, beating its initial target of JPY25 billion (approximately $222 million). CITIC Capital Japan Partners III’s limited partners included sovereign wealth fund, financial institutions, pension fund and fund–of-funds.
PRESS RELEASE
(Tokyo, 6 February 2017) CITIC Capital Partners Limited (“CITIC Capital Partners” or “CCP”), the private equity arm of CITIC Capital Holdings Limited (“CITIC Capital”), is pleased to announce the final closing of its third Japan buyout fund (“CITIC Capital Japan Partners III, L.P.” or “CCJP III”) at its hard cap of JPY30 billion.
The amount raised is well beyond the initial target of JPY25 billion as the fund was practically oversubscribed relative to the hard cap due to significant demand from existing and new investors. In an oversubscribed fundraise, the fund attracted both Japanese and non-Japanese institutional investors, including sovereign wealth fund, financial institutions, pension fund and fund–of-funds.
Mr. Yichen ZHANG, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of CITIC Capital, stated: “We are delighted by the strong support we received from both existing and new investors. Their support is a recognition of our success in establishing a strong franchise in the Japan PE market, and a validation of the tremendous investment opportunity presented by Japanese companies requiring backing in their international expansion, and our deep network of China relationships. We look forward to expanding our Japan franchise through CCJP III.” 





Mr. Hironobu NAKANO, head of CITIC Capital Partners’ Japan operations, said: “Over the past twelve years we have been steadily accumulating our unique experiences in helping Japanese companies to successfully increase their corporate values by leveraging our China value-add capability. Based on our track record, we are very happy to see the final closing of CCJP III with a wider variety of sophisticated institutional investors.”
CCP launched its first Japan buyout fund in 2004 and since then has been an active player in the Japan PE market sponsoring the growth of mid-sized portfolio companies with its unique China angle and resources. Through the last two funds, the maiden fund of JPY 16.9 billion (launched in 2004) and its successor fund of JPY 18.2 billion (launched in 2010), CCP has successfully helped a number of Japanese companies in the manufacturing, retail and logistic sectors, all of which have generated strong returns for its investors.
The third fund has already made three investments to date and CCP is looking to make approximately 10 investments in total, focusing on consumer goods and services, in addition to manufacturing. These sectors are expected to benefit from strong growth in China arising from a structural transformation of its economy into a domestic consumption-driven one.
CCJP III made its first investment with MARK STYLER Co., Ltd., a leading young women’s apparel company. It operates over 170 direct stores across Japan with an e-commerce portal and considers foreign expansion into China a major growth driver together with further enhancement of its domestic business. 





CCJP III also purchased Akakura Co., Ltd., a women’s footwear retailing company, through its civil rehabilitation proceedings, and is now leading its revitalization process to grow again.
The most recent investment by CCJP III is a diagnostic drug company which is one of the leading players in the Japanese market. The company believes China/Asia will be a huge market with a growing demand for quality products and solutions to combat infection diseases.
CITIC Capital Partners is strongly committed to supporting the management teams and employees of the companies it acquires, and to unlocking their corporate values further through improvement and expansion of business operation both in the domestic and overseas markets.

CITIC Limited previously known as CITIC Pacific is a diversified company with a primary focus on special steel manufacturing, property and iron ore mining, which supplies the raw material needed in the making of special steel and property development in mainland China. CITIC Pacific's operating segments include special steel, iron ore mining, property, civil infrastructure, power generation and other business areas. CITIC Pacific's subsidiaries include CITIC Pacific Mining, CITIC Pacific Special Steel, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited and CITIC Telecom International. DCH Holdings is a distributor of motor vehicles, food and consumer products. CITIC Telecom International owns and operates a telecoms hub that provides interoperability, interconnections and value-added services.
On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific’s history. All operating business segments performed well, in particular special steel. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million.
The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia’s North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China.
The Sino Iron project is intended to help satisfy demand from China’s steelmaking industry by providing a reliable source of high quality iron concentrate. The products from the Sino Iron project will not only be used in CITIC Pacific’s special steel mills in China, but also in other Chinese steel mills. One of the advantages of magnetite concentrate is its high iron content and low impurities compared to traditional iron ore products.
The project was conceived in 2006 with a total cost of under $2 billion. However costs by 2012 had reached $7.1 billion, leading to disputes among the partners of the project.[2] In July 2012, with production due to begin within weeks, the budget was increased further to 8 billion USD. The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes.[3]
As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants – Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company’s annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding.[citation needed]
On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific’s properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai’s Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city’s new railway transport system. Zhujiajiao New Town in Shanghai and Noble Manor in Yangzhou are large-scale residential developments offering comprehensive community facilities. Our[who?] Shenzhou Peninsula project on Hainan Island will benefit from the government’s plan to promote the island as an international tourism destination.[4]
History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (October 2016)


2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy[edit]
In October 2008, the Chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to "unauthorized trades".[5] The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure. Losses were incurred on the contracts when the currency declined from 98.5% against the US dollar to less than 70%.[6] Its parent company, CITIC Group pledged its support to this subsidiary.[5]
The board became aware of this on 7 September 2008, and disclosure was made to the financial markets after trading in its shares was suspended on 20 October. The company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission faced questions by legislators about the severe delays in their disclosure,[7] considering the company made a[8] pursuant to a proposed acquisition, that as at 9 September 2008, "the Directors are not aware of any material adverse change in the financial or trading position of the Group since 31 December 2007".[7] When the shares resumed trading, the share price had fallen by some 75% since the previous close.[9]
As a result of the revelations, two officers were forced to resign in disgrace.[10][11] Due to her involvement in the loss, the chairman's daughter was demoted. The chairman claimed his daughter Frances Yung had not informed him about the situation before its discovery.[5] Managing Director Henry Fan temporarily stepped down from the Executive Council and the chairmanship of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, and all other major public positions he held with effect 24 October 2008.[12]
On 3 April 2009, trading in CITIC Pacific shares was once again suspended,[13] and the Hong Kong Police searched the company's office as part of an investigation into whether the company directors had made false statements about the foreign-exchange contracts, as well as company announcements made between July 2007 and March 2009, or had conspired to defraud.[9] On 8 April, chairman Larry Yung resigned, citing the effect of the Commercial Crimes Bureau's visit to the company on public opinion; Managing Director Henry Fan resigned at the same time. They were replaced by Chang Zhenming, the Chairman of the CITIC Group.[14]
Recent history[edit]
CITIC Pacific bought most of the assets from the parent company and issue new shares to the parent, making most of the assets of CITIC Group were listing in a stock exchange. However, CITIC Group still retained the stake in CITIC Guoan Group.
In 2014 the name of the company was also changed from CITIC Pacific Limited (Chinese: 中信泰富有限公司) to just CITIC Limited (Chinese: 中國中信股份有限公司).[15]
On 20 January 2015, the Japanese general trading company Itochu and its Thai cross-shareholding affiliate Charoen Pokphand announced an investment of approx. HK$80 billion (US$10.4 billion) in CITIC Limited, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[16] The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[17]
The deal saw Chia Tai Bright Investment, a 50-50 joint venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand, acquire a 10% stake of CITIC Limited from CITIC Group for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion), as well as subscribing new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (US$5.9 billion).[18] Before the deal, CITIC Group owned 77.90% stake, with National Social Security Fund owned an additional 5.00%, making only 17.1% shares of CITIC Limited were actually free float at 31 December 2014.[15] The company also had HK$13.834 billion perpetual capital securities at 31 December 2014.[15]
On 9 January 2017 the consortium of CITIC Limited, private equity funds of CITIC Capital and Carlyle, bought 80% stake of the franchise rights of McDonald's in Hong Kong and mainland China, for a total consideration of up to US$2.08 billion. CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would own 52% stake collectively (via an intermediate holding in a 61.54–38.46 ratio, indirectly owned 32% and 20% stake respectively), while Carlyle would own 28% separately. 20% stake would be retained by McDonald's via Golden Arches Investments Limited (the trading name of McDonald's Hong Kong).[19]

On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific’s history. All operating business segments performed well, in particular special steel. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million.
The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia’s North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China.
The Sino Iron project is intended to help satisfy demand from China’s steelmaking industry by providing a reliable source of high quality iron concentrate. The products from the Sino Iron project will not only be used in CITIC Pacific’s special steel mills in China, but also in other Chinese steel mills. One of the advantages of magnetite concentrate is its high iron content and low impurities compared to traditional iron ore products.
The project was conceived in 2006 with a total cost of under $2 billion. However costs by 2012 had reached $7.1 billion, leading to disputes among the partners of the project.[2] In July 2012, with production due to begin within weeks, the budget was increased further to 8 billion USD. The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes.[3]
As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants – Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company’s annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding.[citation needed]
On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific’s properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai’s Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city’s new railway transport system. Zhujiajiao New Town in Shanghai and Noble Manor in Yangzhou are large-scale residential developments offering comprehensive community facilities. Our[who?] Shenzhou Peninsula project on Hainan Island will benefit from the government’s plan to promote the island as an international tourism destination.[4]

2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy[edit]
In October 2008, the Chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to "unauthorized trades".[5] The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure. Losses were incurred on the contracts when the currency declined from 98.5% against the US dollar to less than 70%.[6] Its parent company, CITIC Group pledged its support to this subsidiary.[5]
The board became aware of this on 7 September 2008, and disclosure was made to the financial markets after trading in its shares was suspended on 20 October. The company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission faced questions by legislators about the severe delays in their disclosure,[7] considering the company made a[8] pursuant to a proposed acquisition, that as at 9 September 2008, "the Directors are not aware of any material adverse change in the financial or trading position of the Group since 31 December 2007".[7] When the shares resumed trading, the share price had fallen by some 75% since the previous close.[9]
As a result of the revelations, two officers were forced to resign in disgrace.[10][11] Due to her involvement in the loss, the chairman's daughter was demoted. The chairman claimed his daughter Frances Yung had not informed him about the situation before its discovery.[5] Managing Director Henry Fan temporarily stepped down from the Executive Council and the chairmanship of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, and all other major public positions he held with effect 24 October 2008.[12]
On 3 April 2009, trading in CITIC Pacific shares was once again suspended,[13] and the Hong Kong Police searched the company's office as part of an investigation into whether the company directors had made false statements about the foreign-exchange contracts, as well as company announcements made between July 2007 and March 2009, or had conspired to defraud.[9] On 8 April, chairman Larry Yung resigned, citing the effect of the Commercial Crimes Bureau's visit to the company on public opinion; Managing Director Henry Fan resigned at the same time. They were replaced by Chang Zhenming, the Chairman of the CITIC Group.[14]
Recent history[edit]
CITIC Pacific bought most of the assets from the parent company and issue new shares to the parent, making most of the assets of CITIC Group were listing in a stock exchange. However, CITIC Group still retained the stake in CITIC Guoan Group.
In 2014 the name of the company was also changed from CITIC Pacific Limited (Chinese: 中信泰富有限公司) to just CITIC Limited (Chinese: 中國中信股份有限公司).[15]
On 20 January 2015, the Japanese general trading company Itochu and its Thai cross-shareholding affiliate Charoen Pokphand announced an investment of approx. HK$80 billion (US$10.4 billion) in CITIC Limited, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[16] The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[17]
The deal saw Chia Tai Bright Investment, a 50-50 joint venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand, acquire a 10% stake of CITIC Limited from CITIC Group for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion), as well as subscribing new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (US$5.9 billion).[18] Before the deal, CITIC Group owned 77.90% stake, with National Social Security Fund owned an additional 5.00%, making only 17.1% shares of CITIC Limited were actually free float at 31 December 2014.[15] The company also had HK$13.834 billion perpetual capital securities at 31 December 2014.[15]
On 9 January 2017 the consortium of CITIC Limited, private equity funds of CITIC Capital and Carlyle, bought 80% stake of the franchise rights of McDonald's in Hong Kong and mainland China, for a total consideration of up to US$2.08 billion. CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would own 52% stake collectively (via an intermediate holding in a 61.54–38.46 ratio, indirectly owned 32% and 20% stake respectively), while Carlyle would own 28% separately. 20% stake would be retained by McDonald's via Golden Arches Investments Limited (the trading name of McDonald's Hong Kong).[19]

CITIC Limited previously known as CITIC Pacific is a diversified company with a primary focus on special steel manufacturing, property and iron ore mining, which supplies the raw material needed in the making of special steel and property development in mainland China. CITIC Pacific's operating segments include special steel, iron ore mining, property, civil infrastructure, power generation and other business areas. CITIC Pacific's subsidiaries include CITIC Pacific Mining, CITIC Pacific Special Steel, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited and CITIC Telecom International. DCH Holdings is a distributor of motor vehicles, food and consumer products. CITIC Telecom International owns and operates a telecoms hub that provides interoperability, interconnections and value-added services.
On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific’s history. All operating business segments performed well, in particular special steel. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million.
The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia’s North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China.
The Sino Iron project is intended to help satisfy demand from China’s steelmaking industry by providing a reliable source of high quality iron concentrate. The products from the Sino Iron project will not only be used in CITIC Pacific’s special steel mills in China, but also in other Chinese steel mills. One of the advantages of magnetite concentrate is its high iron content and low impurities compared to traditional iron ore products.

However costs by 2012 had reached $7.1 billion, leading to disputes among the partners of the project.[2] In July 2012, with production due to begin within weeks, the budget was increased further to 8 billion USD. The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes.[3]
As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants – Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company’s annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding.[citation needed]
On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific’s properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai’s Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city’s new railway transport system. Zhujiajiao New Town in Shanghai and Noble Manor in Yangzhou are large-scale residential developments offering comprehensive community facilities.

2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy[edit]
In October 2008, the Chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to "unauthorized trades".[5] The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure. Losses were incurred on the contracts when the currency declined from 98.5% against the US dollar to less than 70%.[6] Its parent company, CITIC Group pledged its support to this subsidiary.[5]
The board became aware of this on 7 September 2008, and disclosure was made to the financial markets after trading in its shares was suspended on 20 October. The company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission faced questions by legislators about the severe delays in their disclosure,[7] considering the company made a[8] pursuant to a proposed acquisition, that as at 9 September 2008, "the Directors are not aware of any material adverse change in the financial or trading position of the Group since 31 December 2007".[7] When the shares resumed trading, the share price had fallen by some 75% since the previous close.[9]
As a result of the revelations, two officers were forced to resign in disgrace.[10][11] Due to her involvement in the loss, the chairman's daughter was demoted. The chairman claimed his daughter Frances Yung had not informed him about the situation before its discovery.[5] Managing Director Henry Fan temporarily stepped down from the Executive Council and the chairmanship of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, and all other major public positions he held with effect 24 October 2008.[12]
On 3 April 2009, trading in CITIC Pacific shares was once again suspended,[13] and the Hong Kong Police searched the company's office as part of an investigation into whether the company directors had made false statements about the foreign-exchange contracts, as well as company announcements made between July 2007 and March 2009, or had conspired to defraud.[9] On 8 April, chairman Larry Yung resigned, citing the effect of the Commercial Crimes Bureau's visit to the company on public opinion; Managing Director Henry Fan resigned at the same time. They were replaced by Chang Zhenming, the Chairman of the CITIC Group.[14]
Recent history[edit]
CITIC Pacific bought most of the assets from the parent company and issue new shares to the parent, making most of the assets of CITIC Group were listing in a stock exchange. However, CITIC Group still retained the stake in CITIC Guoan Group.
In 2014 the name of the company was also changed from CITIC Pacific Limited (Chinese: 中信泰富有限公司) to just CITIC Limited (Chinese: 中國中信股份有限公司).[15]
On 20 January 2015, the Japanese general trading company Itochu and its Thai cross-shareholding affiliate Charoen Pokphand announced an investment of approx. HK$80 billion (US$10.4 billion) in CITIC Limited, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[16] The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[17]
The deal saw Chia Tai Bright Investment, a 50-50 joint venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand, acquire a 10% stake of CITIC Limited from CITIC Group for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion), as well as subscribing new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (US$5.9 billion).[18] Before the deal, CITIC Group owned 77.90% stake, with National Social Security Fund owned an additional 5.00%, making only 17.1% shares of CITIC Limited were actually free float at 31 December 2014.[15] The company also had HK$13.834 billion perpetual capital securities at 31 December 2014.[15]
On 9 January 2017 the consortium of CITIC Limited, private equity funds of CITIC Capital and Carlyle, bought 80% stake of the franchise rights of McDonald's in Hong Kong and mainland China, for a total consideration of up to US$2.08 billion. CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would own 52% stake collectively (via an intermediate holding in a 61.54–38.46 ratio, indirectly owned 32% and 20% stake respectively), while Carlyle would own 28% separately. 20% stake would be retained by McDonald's via Golden Arches Investments Limited (the trading name of McDonald's Hong Kong).[19]

CITIC Limited previously known as CITIC Pacific is a diversified company with a primary focus on special steel manufacturing, property and iron ore mining, which supplies the raw material needed in the making of special steel and property development in mainland China. CITIC Pacific's operating segments include special steel, iron ore mining, property, civil infrastructure, power generation and other business areas. CITIC Pacific's subsidiaries include CITIC Pacific Mining, CITIC Pacific Special Steel, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited and CITIC Telecom International. DCH Holdings is a distributor of motor vehicles, food and consumer products. CITIC Telecom International owns and operates a telecoms hub that provides interoperability, interconnections and value-added services.
On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific’s history. All operating business segments performed well, in particular special steel. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million.
The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia’s North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China.
The Sino Iron project is intended to help satisfy demand from China’s steelmaking industry by providing a reliable source of high quality iron concentrate. The products from the Sino Iron project will not only be used in CITIC Pacific’s special steel mills in China, but also in other Chinese steel mills. One of the advantages of magnetite concentrate is its high iron content and low impurities compared to traditional iron ore products.
The project was conceived in 2006 with a total cost of under $2 billion. However costs by 2012 had reached $7.1 billion, leading to disputes among the partners of the project.[2] In July 2012, with production due to begin within weeks, the budget was increased further to 8 billion USD. The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes.[3]
As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants – Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company’s annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding.[citation needed]
On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific’s properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai’s Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city’s new railway transport system. Zhujiajiao New Town in Shanghai and Noble Manor in Yangzhou are large-scale residential developments offering comprehensive community facilities. Our[who?] Shenzhou Peninsula project on Hainan Island will benefit from the government’s plan to promote the island as an international tourism destination.[4]
History[edit]

2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy[edit]
In October 2008, the Chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to "unauthorized trades".[5] The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure. Losses were incurred on the contracts when the currency declined from 98.5% against the US dollar to less than 70%.[6] Its parent company, CITIC Group pledged its support to this subsidiary.[5]
The board became aware of this on 7 September 2008, and disclosure was made to the financial markets after trading in its shares was suspended on 20 October. The company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission faced questions by legislators about the severe delays in their disclosure,[7] considering the company made a[8] pursuant to a proposed acquisition, that as at 9 September 2008, "the Directors are not aware of any material adverse change in the financial or trading position of the Group since 31 December 2007".[7] When the shares resumed trading, the share price had fallen by some 75% since the previous close.[9]
As a result of the revelations, two officers were forced to resign in disgrace.[10][11] Due to her involvement in the loss, the chairman's daughter was demoted. The chairman claimed his daughter Frances Yung had not informed him about the situation before its discovery.[5] Managing Director Henry Fan temporarily stepped down from the Executive Council and the chairmanship of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, and all other major public positions he held with effect 24 October 2008.[12]
On 3 April 2009, trading in CITIC Pacific shares was once again suspended,[13] and the Hong Kong Police searched the company's office as part of an investigation into whether the company directors had made false statements about the foreign-exchange contracts, as well as company announcements made between July 2007 and March 2009, or had conspired to defraud.[9] On 8 April, chairman Larry Yung resigned, citing the effect of the Commercial Crimes Bureau's visit to the company on public opinion; Managing Director Henry Fan resigned at the same time. They were replaced by Chang Zhenming, the Chairman of the CITIC Group.[14]
Recent history[edit]
CITIC Pacific bought most of the assets from the parent company and issue new shares to the parent, making most of the assets of CITIC Group were listing in a stock exchange. However, CITIC Group still retained the stake in CITIC Guoan Group.
In 2014 the name of the company was also changed from CITIC Pacific Limited (Chinese: 中信泰富有限公司) to just CITIC Limited (Chinese: 中國中信股份有限公司).[15]
On 20 January 2015, the Japanese general trading company Itochu and its Thai cross-shareholding affiliate Charoen Pokphand announced an investment of approx. HK$80 billion (US$10.4 billion) in CITIC Limited, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[16] The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[17]
The deal saw Chia Tai Bright Investment, a 50-50 joint venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand, acquire a 10% stake of CITIC Limited from CITIC Group for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion), as well as subscribing new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (US$5.9 billion).[18] Before the deal, CITIC Group owned 77.90% stake, with National Social Security Fund owned an additional 5.00%, making only 17.1% shares of CITIC Limited were actually free float at 31 December 2014.[15] The company also had HK$13.834 billion perpetual capital securities at 31 December 2014.[15]
On 9 January 2017 the consortium of CITIC Limited, private equity funds of CITIC Capital and Carlyle, bought 80% stake of the franchise rights of McDonald's in Hong Kong and mainland China, for a total consideration of up to US$2.08 billion. CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would own 52% stake collectively (via an intermediate holding in a 61.54–38.46 ratio, indirectly owned 32% and 20% stake respectively), while Carlyle would own 28% separately. 20% stake would be retained by McDonald's via Golden Arches Investments Limited (the trading name of McDonald's Hong Kong).[19]

CITIC Limited previously known as CITIC Pacific is a diversified company with a primary focus on special steel manufacturing, property and iron ore mining, which supplies the raw material needed in the making of special steel and property development in mainland China. CITIC Pacific's operating segments include special steel, iron ore mining, property, civil infrastructure, power generation and other business areas. CITIC Pacific's subsidiaries include CITIC Pacific Mining, CITIC Pacific Special Steel, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited and CITIC Telecom International. DCH Holdings is a distributor of motor vehicles, food and consumer products. CITIC Telecom International owns and operates a telecoms hub that provides interoperability, interconnections and value-added services.
On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific’s history. All operating business segments performed well, in particular special steel. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million.
The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia’s North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China.

The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes.[3]
As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants – Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company’s annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding.[citation needed]
On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific’s properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai’s Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city’s new railway transport system. Zhujiajiao New Town in Shanghai and Noble Manor in Yangzhou are large-scale residential developments offering comprehensive community facilities. Our[who?] Shenzhou Peninsula project on Hainan Island will benefit from the government’s plan to promote the island as an international tourism destination.[4]

2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy[edit]
In October 2008, the Chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to "unauthorized trades".[5] The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure. Losses were incurred on the contracts when the currency declined from 98.5% against the US dollar to less than 70%.[6] Its parent company, CITIC Group pledged its support to this subsidiary.[5]

The company and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission faced questions by legislators about the severe delays in their disclosure,[7] considering the company made a[8] pursuant to a proposed acquisition, that as at 9 September 2008, "the Directors are not aware of any material adverse change in the financial or trading position of the Group since 31 December 2007".[7] When the shares resumed trading, the share price had fallen by some 75% since the previous close.[9]
As a result of the revelations, two officers were forced to resign in disgrace.[10][11] Due to her involvement in the loss, the chairman's daughter was demoted. The chairman claimed his daughter Frances Yung had not informed him about the situation before its discovery.[5] Managing Director Henry Fan temporarily stepped down from the Executive Council and the chairmanship of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, and all other major public positions he held with effect 24 October 2008.[12]
On 3 April 2009, trading in CITIC Pacific shares was once again suspended,[13] and the Hong Kong Police searched the company's office as part of an investigation into whether the company directors had made false statements about the foreign-exchange contracts, as well as company announcements made between July 2007 and March 2009, or had conspired to defraud.[9] On 8 April, chairman Larry Yung resigned, citing the effect of the Commercial Crimes Bureau's visit to the company on public opinion; Managing Director Henry Fan resigned at the same time. They were replaced by Chang Zhenming, the Chairman of the CITIC Group.[14]
Recent history[edit]
CITIC Pacific bought most of the assets from the parent company and issue new shares to the parent, making most of the assets of CITIC Group were listing in a stock exchange. However, CITIC Group still retained the stake in CITIC Guoan Group.
In 2014 the name of the company was also changed from CITIC Pacific Limited (Chinese: 中信泰富有限公司) to just CITIC Limited (Chinese: 中國中信股份有限公司).[15]
On 20 January 2015, the Japanese general trading company Itochu and its Thai cross-shareholding affiliate Charoen Pokphand announced an investment of approx. HK$80 billion (US$10.4 billion) in CITIC Limited, the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company.[16] The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise.[17]
The deal saw Chia Tai Bright Investment, a 50-50 joint venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand, acquire a 10% stake of CITIC Limited from CITIC Group for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion), as well as subscribing new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (US$5.9 billion).[18] Before the deal, CITIC Group owned 77.90% stake, with National Social Security Fund owned an additional 5.00%, making only 17.1% shares of CITIC Limited were actually free float at 31 December 2014.[15] The company also had HK$13.834 billion perpetual capital securities at 31 December 2014.[15]
On 9 January 2017 the consortium of CITIC Limited, private equity funds of CITIC Capital and Carlyle, bought 80% stake of the franchise rights of McDonald's in Hong Kong and mainland China, for a total consideration of up to US$2.08 billion. CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would own 52% stake collectively (via an intermediate holding in a 61.54–38.46 ratio, indirectly owned 32% and 20% stake respectively), while Carlyle would own 28% separately. 20% stake would be retained by McDonald's via Golden Arches Investments Limited (the trading name of McDonald's Hong Kong).[19]
