Education[edit]
Barzun grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and attended Westover School (Connecticut) and Lake Forest College (Illinois). She received her master's degree in marriage, family and child counseling at Notre Dame De Namur University (California) with an emphasis in art therapy.
Diplomacy in Stockholm[edit]
In Sweden, where she lived from 2009 to 2011, Barzun led cultural diplomacy efforts. She led the curation of three contemporary art shows: a show of Swedish art at the American residence, a show entitled Transparency and Trans-formations in contemporary American Art[2] featuring American art in coordination with U.S. Department of State's Art in Embassies program and artwithoutwalls, and Underglow,[5] a public art installation by artist Chris Doyle. She was a common presence at cultural events in Stockholm.[6][7]
Cultural leadership in Louisville[edit]
In the fall of 2011, after the death of her father, Owsley Brown II, a devoted patron of the arts in Louisville, Barzun joined the board of Louisville's Speed Art Museum and set about completing the capital campaign Brown had begun for a major expansion.[8] Barzun took over as co-chair and completed "phase 2" of fundraising for the project. She was then named co-chair for the third and final phase. In May 2013, it was announced that the fundraising goal had been met years ahead of schedule. The effort "[put] us five to 10 years ahead of where we thought we would be in completing the master plan," according to Speed board president Allan Latts, and reduced the project's original budget by $20 million because of cost savings captured from an accelerated construction timetable.[4] Barzun currently serves on the search committee for the museum's next director.

Education[edit]
Barzun was born in New York City. He grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and received his A.B. in history and literature magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1993. In his testimony to the Senate during his confirmation vetting, Barzun noted that he had served as a summer intern to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 1989. Prior to attending university, he was a student at St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. After graduating from Harvard College, he began working with CNET Networks.[5][6][7]
2008 Obama campaign[edit]
Barzun's small-dollar fundraisers were supporter-driven via online event pages, and replicated throughout the country.[citation needed]
In The Audacity to Win, author and political strategist David Plouffe describes Matthew Barzun's grassroots campaign idea as "citizen fundraisers" that drove Obama's connection with supporters.[8]
Diplomacy[edit]
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, chaired by Senator John Kerry, approved Barzun's nomination as Ambassador to Sweden during the week of August 3, 2009, and the nomination was confirmed on August 7. Barzun was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sweden on August 12, 2009, and presented his credentials to King Carl XVI Gustaf on August 21, 2009.[9] Barzun prioritized outreach and personal engagement, launching the U.S. Embassy Road Show that brings embassy personnel, resources, and exhibits out of Stockholm to smaller cities and towns.[10] In partnership with the Swedish government, he also created the Swedish American Green Alliance where Swedes and Americans share news and ideas toward a clean energy future.[11]
President Obama nominated Barzun to be the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2013.[12][13] The Senate confirmed him by unanimous consent on August 1, 2013. He presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 27, 2013.[14] Barzun set up the Young Leaders UK (YLUK) programme whilst in office, which allowed him to communicate and speak with young people from across the United Kingdom. YLUK met with President Obama during his visit to the UK in 2016.[15] Barzun was selected by the U.S. Department of State as the winner of the 2016 Sue M. Cobb Award for Exemplary Diplomatic Service for "his passion and commitment during his tenure in London by promoting American values and ideals, and his dedication to developing the next generation of career Foreign Service Officers."[16]
In January 2017, Barzun announced that he was to leave as Ambassador before Donald Trump took office. Barzun left the UK on 18 January 2017, moving back to Kentucky. The then Deputy Chief of Mission, Lewis Lukens, then succeeded Barzun as Chargé d'affaires pending the appointment of a new ambassador.[1][17] Upon his return to the United States, he received the Marshall Medal from the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission created by the British Parliament for his dedication to strengthening U.S. and British relations.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Matthew Barzun is a descendant of Lucretia Mott,[19] a proponent of women's rights, and John Winthrop, founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the city of Boston.[20] His grandfather was the renowned French-born American cultural historian and former Columbia University professor, Jacques Barzun. He is the second of four children. His younger sister is film producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly, Emmy and Golden Globe winner for her work producing Grey Gardens for HBO.
His younger brother, Charles Barzun, is a tenured professor of law at the University of Virginia. His eldest sister, Mariana Mensch, is director of parent giving and assistant campaign director at Vassar College. He has stated that his favourite band is The National,[21] and that he has a dislike for the traditional British meal of lamb and potatoes, which was served to him 180 times in his first year as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[22]
Barzun is married (since 1999) to Brooke Brown Barzun, heiress of the Brown-Forman Corporation distilling empire, which includes the brands Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve. They live in Louisville, Kentucky, Brooke's hometown.[20] They have three children.

Education[edit]
Barzun was born in New York City. He grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and received his A.B. in history and literature magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1993. In his testimony to the Senate during his confirmation vetting, Barzun noted that he had served as a summer intern to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 1989. Prior to attending university, he was a student at St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. After graduating from Harvard College, he began working with CNET Networks.[5][6][7]
2008 Obama campaign[edit]
Barzun's small-dollar fundraisers were supporter-driven via online event pages, and replicated throughout the country.[citation needed]
In The Audacity to Win, author and political strategist David Plouffe describes Matthew Barzun's grassroots campaign idea as "citizen fundraisers" that drove Obama's connection with supporters.[8]
Diplomacy[edit]
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, chaired by Senator John Kerry, approved Barzun's nomination as Ambassador to Sweden during the week of August 3, 2009, and the nomination was confirmed on August 7. Barzun was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sweden on August 12, 2009, and presented his credentials to King Carl XVI Gustaf on August 21, 2009.[9] Barzun prioritized outreach and personal engagement, launching the U.S. Embassy Road Show that brings embassy personnel, resources, and exhibits out of Stockholm to smaller cities and towns.[10] In partnership with the Swedish government, he also created the Swedish American Green Alliance where Swedes and Americans share news and ideas toward a clean energy future.[11]
President Obama nominated Barzun to be the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2013.[12][13] The Senate confirmed him by unanimous consent on August 1, 2013. He presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 27, 2013.[14] Barzun set up the Young Leaders UK (YLUK) programme whilst in office, which allowed him to communicate and speak with young people from across the United Kingdom. YLUK met with President Obama during his visit to the UK in 2016.[15] Barzun was selected by the U.S. Department of State as the winner of the 2016 Sue M. Cobb Award for Exemplary Diplomatic Service for "his passion and commitment during his tenure in London by promoting American values and ideals, and his dedication to developing the next generation of career Foreign Service Officers."[16]
In January 2017, Barzun announced that he was to leave as Ambassador before Donald Trump took office. Barzun left the UK on 18 January 2017, moving back to Kentucky. The then Deputy Chief of Mission, Lewis Lukens, then succeeded Barzun as Chargé d'affaires pending the appointment of a new ambassador.[1][17] Upon his return to the United States, he received the Marshall Medal from the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission created by the British Parliament for his dedication to strengthening U.S. and British relations.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Matthew Barzun is a descendant of Lucretia Mott,[19] a proponent of women's rights, and John Winthrop, founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the city of Boston.[20] His grandfather was the renowned French-born American cultural historian and former Columbia University professor, Jacques Barzun. He is the second of four children. His younger sister is film producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly, Emmy and Golden Globe winner for her work producing Grey Gardens for HBO.
His younger brother, Charles Barzun, is a tenured professor of law at the University of Virginia. His eldest sister, Mariana Mensch, is director of parent giving and assistant campaign director at Vassar College. He has stated that his favourite band is The National,[21] and that he has a dislike for the traditional British meal of lamb and potatoes, which was served to him 180 times in his first year as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[22]
Barzun is married (since 1999) to Brooke Brown Barzun, heiress of the Brown-Forman Corporation distilling empire, which includes the brands Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve. They live in Louisville, Kentucky, Brooke's hometown.[20] They have three children.

Education[edit]
Barzun was born in New York City. He grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and received his A.B. in history and literature magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1993. In his testimony to the Senate during his confirmation vetting, Barzun noted that he had served as a summer intern to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 1989. Prior to attending university, he was a student at St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. After graduating from Harvard College, he began working with CNET Networks.[5][6][7]
2008 Obama campaign[edit]
Barzun's small-dollar fundraisers were supporter-driven via online event pages, and replicated throughout the country.[citation needed]
In The Audacity to Win, author and political strategist David Plouffe describes Matthew Barzun's grassroots campaign idea as "citizen fundraisers" that drove Obama's connection with supporters.[8]
Diplomacy[edit]
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, chaired by Senator John Kerry, approved Barzun's nomination as Ambassador to Sweden during the week of August 3, 2009, and the nomination was confirmed on August 7. Barzun was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sweden on August 12, 2009, and presented his credentials to King Carl XVI Gustaf on August 21, 2009.[9] Barzun prioritized outreach and personal engagement, launching the U.S. Embassy Road Show that brings embassy personnel, resources, and exhibits out of Stockholm to smaller cities and towns.[10] In partnership with the Swedish government, he also created the Swedish American Green Alliance where Swedes and Americans share news and ideas toward a clean energy future.[11]
President Obama nominated Barzun to be the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2013.[12][13] The Senate confirmed him by unanimous consent on August 1, 2013. He presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 27, 2013.[14] Barzun set up the Young Leaders UK (YLUK) programme whilst in office, which allowed him to communicate and speak with young people from across the United Kingdom. YLUK met with President Obama during his visit to the UK in 2016.[15] Barzun was selected by the U.S. Department of State as the winner of the 2016 Sue M. Cobb Award for Exemplary Diplomatic Service for "his passion and commitment during his tenure in London by promoting American values and ideals, and his dedication to developing the next generation of career Foreign Service Officers."[16]
In January 2017, Barzun announced that he was to leave as Ambassador before Donald Trump took office. Barzun left the UK on 18 January 2017, moving back to Kentucky. The then Deputy Chief of Mission, Lewis Lukens, then succeeded Barzun as Chargé d'affaires pending the appointment of a new ambassador.[1][17] Upon his return to the United States, he received the Marshall Medal from the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission created by the British Parliament for his dedication to strengthening U.S. and British relations.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Matthew Barzun is a descendant of Lucretia Mott,[19] a proponent of women's rights, and John Winthrop, founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the city of Boston.[20] His grandfather was the renowned French-born American cultural historian and former Columbia University professor, Jacques Barzun. He is the second of four children. His younger sister is film producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly, Emmy and Golden Globe winner for her work producing Grey Gardens for HBO.
His younger brother, Charles Barzun, is a tenured professor of law at the University of Virginia. His eldest sister, Mariana Mensch, is director of parent giving and assistant campaign director at Vassar College. He has stated that his favourite band is The National,[21] and that he has a dislike for the traditional British meal of lamb and potatoes, which was served to him 180 times in his first year as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[22]
Barzun is married (since 1999) to Brooke Brown Barzun, heiress of the Brown-Forman Corporation distilling empire, which includes the brands Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve. They live in Louisville, Kentucky, Brooke's hometown.[20] They have three children.

Education[edit]
Barzun was born in New York City. He grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and received his A.B. in history and literature magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1993. In his testimony to the Senate during his confirmation vetting, Barzun noted that he had served as a summer intern to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry in 1989. Prior to attending university, he was a student at St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire. After graduating from Harvard College, he began working with CNET Networks.[5][6][7]
2008 Obama campaign[edit]
Barzun's small-dollar fundraisers were supporter-driven via online event pages, and replicated throughout the country.[citation needed]
In The Audacity to Win, author and political strategist David Plouffe describes Matthew Barzun's grassroots campaign idea as "citizen fundraisers" that drove Obama's connection with supporters.[8]
Diplomacy[edit]
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, chaired by Senator John Kerry, approved Barzun's nomination as Ambassador to Sweden during the week of August 3, 2009, and the nomination was confirmed on August 7. Barzun was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Sweden on August 12, 2009, and presented his credentials to King Carl XVI Gustaf on August 21, 2009.[9] Barzun prioritized outreach and personal engagement, launching the U.S. Embassy Road Show that brings embassy personnel, resources, and exhibits out of Stockholm to smaller cities and towns.[10] In partnership with the Swedish government, he also created the Swedish American Green Alliance where Swedes and Americans share news and ideas toward a clean energy future.[11]
President Obama nominated Barzun to be the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2013.[12][13] The Senate confirmed him by unanimous consent on August 1, 2013. He presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 27, 2013.[14] Barzun set up the Young Leaders UK (YLUK) programme whilst in office, which allowed him to communicate and speak with young people from across the United Kingdom. YLUK met with President Obama during his visit to the UK in 2016.[15] Barzun was selected by the U.S. Department of State as the winner of the 2016 Sue M. Cobb Award for Exemplary Diplomatic Service for "his passion and commitment during his tenure in London by promoting American values and ideals, and his dedication to developing the next generation of career Foreign Service Officers."[16]
In January 2017, Barzun announced that he was to leave as Ambassador before Donald Trump took office. Barzun left the UK on 18 January 2017, moving back to Kentucky. The then Deputy Chief of Mission, Lewis Lukens, then succeeded Barzun as Chargé d'affaires pending the appointment of a new ambassador.[1][17] Upon his return to the United States, he received the Marshall Medal from the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission created by the British Parliament for his dedication to strengthening U.S. and British relations.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Matthew Barzun is a descendant of Lucretia Mott,[19] a proponent of women's rights, and John Winthrop, founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the city of Boston.[20] His grandfather was the renowned French-born American cultural historian and former Columbia University professor, Jacques Barzun. He is the second of four children. His younger sister is film producer Lucy Barzun Donnelly, Emmy and Golden Globe winner for her work producing Grey Gardens for HBO.
His younger brother, Charles Barzun, is a tenured professor of law at the University of Virginia. His eldest sister, Mariana Mensch, is director of parent giving and assistant campaign director at Vassar College. He has stated that his favourite band is The National,[21] and that he has a dislike for the traditional British meal of lamb and potatoes, which was served to him 180 times in his first year as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[22]
Barzun is married (since 1999) to Brooke Brown Barzun, heiress of the Brown-Forman Corporation distilling empire, which includes the brands Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve. They live in Louisville, Kentucky, Brooke's hometown.[20] They have three children.

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREWASHINGTON –  On a train from London to Hull, Matthew Barzun decided to check the web to see what famous people were from the Yorkshire city he was about the visit.The former Louisville Internet entrepreneur knows his way around mathematics and theory, so he was excited to discover that John Venn was from Hull.Venn devised a diagram of intersecting circles now known as, logically, the Venn diagram. The philosopher and logician's contribution is used in computer science, among other fields.Barzun, 44, now the youthful and energetic United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, was so excited recounting his story last week during an interview with The Courier-Journal in a conference room at the State Department that he got up and drew a Venn diagram on the white board."My first thought was I probably owe that guy royalties, because in my Internet days I'd drawn so many Venn diagrams," Barzun joked, retelling the story.But there was a broader point to this story.He labeled one circle "US" and the other "UK" and the intersecting space in the middle is the special relationship the two nations have enjoyed for more than a century, from joining together to help win World War II to the alliance engaged in current negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.Indeed, Barzun said the mere act of looking up John Venn got him thinking more about the common bonds between Great Britain and the United States."I'm on a train, right?" the ambassador began. "Steam locomotion - invented by Brits. It was actually an American who said we should use this for public transit and had a whole plan but couldn't get it done in America because it wasn't developed enough. Then it did, of course, happen in the UK and then it happened in America. I'm using an iPhone, an American product designed by a Brit from Newcastle. I log onto the Internet, invented by Americans, quickly adopted by the UK. Log on to the worldwide web, invented by a Brit, commercialized in America. To use Wikipedia (to find John Venn), founded by an American from Alabama who now lives two blocks away from me in London. So I just thought, you know? There's a happy Venn diagram."Barzun was making one of his infrequent visits home to Kentucky and to Washington, and it is clear he has embraced his role as the nation's most prominent ambassador.He has been in his post since 2013. A key fundraiser for President Barack Obama, Barzun previously served as the U.S. ambassador to Sweden.Barzun and his wife, Brooke, have been a hit in the British capital, bringing a new level of informality and fun to the ambassador's residence, Winfield House, in Regent's Park. The Barzuns hosted a record 10,750 visitors in the residence last year. Those who were at parties might have been treated to a hot new indie band the ambassador likes, or songs with Annie Lennox at the keyboards. Jeans are allowed.The Financial Times credited the American envoy with bringing "a bracing informality to the practice of London diplomacy."The London Evening Standard ran a glowing piece on the Barzuns in February. Much of the story focused on Brooke Barzun under a headline that called her "the hostess with the mostest.""The ambassador and his wife could make Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald look like party poopers," the newspaper enthused. "Now they are using their party power to push social change."The Barzuns recently hosted a session in the residence on women's rights in the workplace.The ambassador also has become known in London as a fervent collector of vinyl records, which he puts on the turntable at gatherings. So that earned him praise for "vinyl diplomacy."Barzun said he simply has tried to put into practice in London what he absorbed after moving to Louisville in 2000: "It's that wonderful blend of southern hospitality meets Midwestern openness…We try to do that in all of our interactions in the UK."When he was first headed to the Court of St. James's, some people advised him to park the term "special relationship," saying it was hackneyed."So I thought about that for a moment, and I think they are totally wrong. I think it really is special," Barzun said, noting that next year will mark the 70th anniversary of Winston Churchill's coining of the "special relationship" phrase in his famous "Iron Curtain" speech in Fulton, Mo. "And it remains today vibrant, vital."Americans may not realize that 1 million people on this side of the Atlantic work for British companies. Likewise, 1 million British workers are employed by American companies.But the relationship goes beyond business and trade and cultural similarities."We mean the same things when we say as, President Obama did when he visited in 2011, that we want to make the world more peaceful, more prosperous, more just. We mean the same things by those important values," Barzun said. "We are willing to stand up, speak up, fight for those values together, shoulder-to-shoulder around the world."The ambassador told me he hopes to stay in London through the end of the Obama presidency."I love this job. I love every single day. Best job I've ever had," Barzun said, his youthful face beaming. "And I do serve at the pleasure of the president, so as long as he wants me here I will gladly continue to serve in this capacity until his term is over - and then I go back to Kentucky."To run for office?He laughed. And repeated his last sentence: "I go back to Kentucky.""No, I really haven't figured out what…," he said, trailing off. "There's so much taking up every day, every week, I just don't…there's more than enough to think about and work on and engage with the Brits on every day."But when he's done in London, he said, "the only thing I know is that it's back to Louisville."Reporter James R.

Brooke BarzunBornBrooke Lee Brown(1972-06-18) June 18, 1972 (age 44)Louisville, Kentucky, United StatesOccupationArt curator and philanthropistSpouse(s)Matthew BarzunBrooke Barzun (born Brooke Lee Brown on June 18, 1972) is an art curator[1][2] and philanthropist[3][4] based in Louisville, Kentucky with her husband, Matthew Barzun, the former United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. She is the daughter of Owsley Brown II and Christy Brown, and the granddaughter of Sally Brown. Her extended family has voting control of Brown-Forman Corporation, the parent company of Jack Daniel's whiskey and other brands.Contents1 Education2 Diplomacy in Stockholm3 Cultural leadership in Louisville4 ReferencesEducationBarzun grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and attended Westover School (Connecticut) and Lake Forest College (Illinois). She received her master's degree in marriage, family and child counseling at Notre Dame De Namur University (California) with an emphasis in art therapy.Diplomacy in StockholmIn Sweden, where she lived from 2009 to 2011, Barzun led cultural diplomacy efforts. She led the curation of three contemporary art shows: a show of Swedish art at the American residence, a show entitled Transparency and Trans-formations in contemporary American Art[2] featuring American art in coordination with U.S. Department of State's Art in Embassies program and artwithoutwalls, and Underglow,[5] a public art installation by artist Chris Doyle. She was a common presence at cultural events in Stockholm.[6][7]Cultural leadership in LouisvilleIn the fall of 2011, after the death of her father, Owsley Brown II, a devoted patron of the arts in Louisville, Barzun joined the board of Louisville's Speed Art Museum and set about completing the capital campaign Brown had begun for a major expansion.[8] Barzun took over as co-chair and completed "phase 2" of fundraising for the project. She was then named co-chair for the third and final phase. In May 2013, it was announced that the fundraising goal had been met years ahead of schedule. The effort "[put] us five to 10 years ahead of where we thought we would be in completing the master plan," according to Speed board president Allan Latts, and reduced the project's original budget by $20 million because of cost savings captured from an accelerated construction timetable.[4] Barzun currently serves on the search committee for the museum's next director.References^ "Art Without Walls :: Public Art projects :: Louisville, KY :: Contemporary Art".

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
