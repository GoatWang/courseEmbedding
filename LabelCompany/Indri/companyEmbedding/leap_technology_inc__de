Core Technology
It may well be that the requirement of your product or application is a good match to the uniqueness of Electroactive Polymers (EAP). LEAP Technology can help you and your company investigate the feasibility of DE sensors, actuators, or energy generators for your specific product or application.
BACKGROUND
Scientists and engineers have long been searching for materials that exhibit similar mechanical characteristics to natural muscle. Such a material would enable an effective replacement of conventional sensing and actuation devices traditionally made from stiff, clunky materials. In this search for an artificial equivalent of muscle, electroactive polymers (EAP) have gained considerable attention as they come close to mimicking their characteristics. Like muscle, EAP is soft, can undergo large and fast deformation, and provide controlled force.
DIELECTRIC ELASTOMERS
Among the various sub-classes of EAP, dielectric elastomers (DE) have received the most commercial focus for use in products. This is due to their simple operation principle, industrial scale manufacturability and long lifetime. Core DE technology comprises an electrical insulating layer of elastomer sandwiched between two deformable layers of electrically conductive material (electrodes). This configuration of the core technology enables its use in mechanical sensors, actuators, energy generators, or combination of two or more in a single device.

WORKING PRINCIPLE – SENSORS
A rubbery nature enables mechanical DE sensors to be easily deformed by a machine or human. This deformation causes a change in the electrical property of DE sensor (the capacitance). This change of capacitance can be measured by simple electronics and converted into relevant units such as force, tension, pressure, angle, 3D motion or speed etc.

WORKING PRINCIPLE – ACTUATORS
Instead of deforming the DE component mechanically as in the sensor function, the material can be deformed electrically. This is achieved by charging the deformable electrodes causing an electrostatic attraction between them. This attraction of electrodes squeezes the insulating elastomer layer forcing it to deform. Appropriate configuration and termination of the DE material can then provide effective force and displacement in a system or product.

WORKING PRINCIPLE – GENERATORS
In generator mode, the DE devices are stretched and relaxed by an external mechanical input (wind, ocean waves, human for example) in a cyclic pattern. By controlling a corresponding cycling voltage on the generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical and can be harvested and supplied to the grid.

DEVICE CONFIGURATIONS
The soft nature of DE technology enables the possibilities of utilizing it as novel sensors, actuators and generator designs that have not previously been possible with other technologies. The devices can be both configured to replace a conventional sensor or actuator, or to perform operations not possible with other transducers.
DE devices can be specifically designed to be compatible with complex systems. Examples of such are the human form, aerodynamic surfaces, hygienic environments or applications subject to shock and vibration whilst still providing effective sensing and actuation.

POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS
LEAP Technology has a wealth of experience in identifying and examining the use of DE technology in potential applications. DE devices have their highest value in applications involving biomechanics, aerodynamics, hygiene, energy efficiency, fast operation, and harsh environment (shock, vibration, temperature). In such applications the soft rubbery nature of DE combined with its fast response, lightweight, and its novel configuration can be best exploited.

Leap Novel Technology, Inc.About usLeap Novel Technology, Inc. (LeapNT) is a
Cincinnati, OH based minority owned (MWBE) premier provider for Supply Chain Procurement Optimization (SCPO) business
solutions including Inbound Supply Chain Management (ISCM). We work with mid-to-large size regional manufacturing companies, identify saving opportunities, and grow their business swiftly both domestically
and internationally. We manage the tedious challenges that come with growth and
allow our clients to focus on their core competencies and do what they are good
at.Problem we try to solveTo meet manufacturing companies’ challenging needs of “lowest working capital” and “highest supply assurance”, cost saving is a must. Generating cost savings from supply chains or manufacturing processes can be hard and lengthy. Most cost savings come from substituting an existing material with a lower priced material, generally lower grade material. Testing and implementing a substituted lower priced material require investments on time and efforts for product specification change, technology change, new manufacturing process design, and etc.Inbound supply chain procurement optimization can be a solution to generate cost savings in a short period of time as low hanging fruits without lengthy and costly material substitution processes. However, inbound supply chain procurement for a mid-to-large size regional manufacturing company can be complex. Since each material can be sourced from different suppliers at different locations with different pricing points, adding additional complexity and dimension of demand, supply, transportation, financial and material, finding an optimized solution manually can be challenging. In addition, procurement managers and supply chain leaders at companies this size normally have no or limited resources to support finding an optimized solution. This makes generate savings from inbound supply chain procurement even harder.Our SolutionLeap SCPO solution uses a proprietary mathematical algorithm which suggests optimization solutions or scenarios based on each company’s unique supply chain situation. In addition, our ease-of-use mobile interface can remove adoption barrier.Contact usEmail: Info@LeapNT.comAddress: P.O. Box 498819             Cincinnati, OH, 45249In The News

Pattern Based Analytics expands the human capability by identifying patterns, reducing the complexity of understanding the data, and structuring results in prioritized, readily comprehensible graphical representation. 








Value
Pattern Based Analytics discovers hypotheses that are not initially apparent.
It efficiently points to what is meaningful in a large, complex data set encompassing all data points and eliminating human and statistical bias.








Quantum Leap Analyst is a Pattern Based Analytics platform that delivers advanced analytics in a form that easily can be used by anyone. A fundamental concept behind practically any form of analytics is that there are relationships or patterns in data that can shed light on the nature of a given outcome. Patterns are signals of behavior, events or episodes. The challenge for the human analyst is to find these patterns and then determine cause/effect relationships.
Quantum Leap Analyst includes breakthrough technology that will automatically discover and validate key relationships or patterns within complex data environments.

Why did we choose pelicans?
A member of the Pelican family, the Northern Gannet is an expert at pattern detection.  Spotting his target while flying 150 feet above the water, the Gannet dives reaching 60 mph before snatching his targeted prey for dinner.

Magic Leap raised $1.4 billion using technology that likely won't be in the real product

  Leap


  Magic Leap, a hot startup last valued at $4.5 billion, raised
  $1.4 billion in funding by showcasing a prototype technology that
  likely won't be used in its commercial product, according to
  a
  report by The Information's Reed Albergotti.

  The prototype, called "The Beast," is described as a
  "rectangular, shoulder-width" box that let people see
  projected images overlaid against the real world by peeking into
  it.

  Most of its investors, including Kleiner Perkins' Bing Gordon,
  invested in Magic Leap after seeing the Beast, expecting the
  commercial product would be downsized to something that looked
  like glasses, the report said.

  But the report claims that most of the technology used in the
  Beast won't be in the product "now planned for commercial
  release," citing former employees. It says that product won't use
  the same lens, and likely won't have the "same level of depth" as
  the Beast's.

  Magic Leap CEO Romy Abovitz told Albergotti that the prototypes
  are "not really what we’re ultimately going to be shipping" but
  it was a good way to show people "what was good about it, what
  was not.”





  The article goes on to describe Magic Leap as going
  
  overboard with its marketing, overselling its technology and
  releasing videos that showed something it wasn't really
  capable of doing yet.

  Magic Leap is developing so-called augmented
  reality hardware that combines the real world
  with computer images, much like the way Microsoft's Hololens
  works.
