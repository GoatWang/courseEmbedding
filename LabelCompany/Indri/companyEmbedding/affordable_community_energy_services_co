OUR TRACK RECORD
Community Energy, Inc. (CEI) was founded in 1999 to ignite the market for fuel-free energy and develop solar and wind generation. CEI built the voluntary market for renewable energy, spurring the demand for hundreds of megawatts of new wind generation with retail customers ahead of state mandates. Now a leading solar developer, CEI has developed hundreds of MW of utility-scale solar across the country including two of the largest projects nation-wide in Georgia and Colorado. CEI also develops customer-sited and community-scale solar projects for businesses, universities, and residential customers. The company was awarded the American Wind Energy Association’s “Market-Maker” Award in 2002, and its Keystone Project received the Photovoltaic Projects of Distinction Award at PV America East in 2013. Those awards recognize what CEI does best—innovative marketing that builds new renewable generation.

Power is more than the outlet on your wall or the light from your window.


                                            Power enables us to look at the road ahead, and to see into dark places. It warms our homes and keeps our families safe. It fuels our technology, tools and our imaginations. Power connects us to one another and liberates us to make what was impossible yesterday, a reality today.
But not all power is created equally, nor is it available to everyone. At CEC we know there is a better way. We believe that knowledge and inspiration have the power to transform skeptics into advocates. We understand that we exist as a part of something bigger and at our core, we empower others to achieve their visions. 
We look to the future and see not only the path less traveled, but the path no one has discovered. We improve the world we all live in by providing affordable, community-shared, clean energy solutions that allow utilities and consumers alike to turn great ideas into tangible results.
                                            Constantly evolving products and services to deliver exceptional value to our customers can be exhausting. So we attract people who are driven by the desire to do what others have deemed impossible. We are a collection of inspired people looking at the future, providing the power to shift from what can be, to what is.

1. What These Terms of Use Cover.




These Terms of Use apply to any RemoteMeter, MyCleanEnergy or other CEC software or services, including but not limited to updates, that display or link to the Terms of Use and that you use while these Terms of Use are in force.

You may start using the service as soon as you have finished the sign-up process.

5. You Are Responsible For Your Service Account.




Only you may use your service account. For some parts of the service, we may notify you that you may set up additional member accounts that are dependent on your account (an 'associated account'). You are responsible for all activity that takes place with your service account or an associated account. You may not authorize any third party to access and/or use the service on your behalf except where CEC provides a mechanism for third parties to access the service on your behalf.







6. Associated Accounts; Accounts From Third Parties.




If you are the user of an associated account, the holder of the service account has full control over your associated account. This includes the right to end the service, close or alter your associated account at any time and, in some cases, request and receive machine and service use information related to your associated account. If a third party, such as a utility, employer or school, gave you your account, the third party has rights to your account. The third party may manage your account, reset your password, or suspend or terminate your account; view your account's usage and profile data, including how and when your account is used; and read or store the content in your account, including electronic communications and other information.







7. Your Content.



You may be able to submit content for use in connection with the service. You understand that CEC does not control or endorse the content that you and others post or provide on the service. Except for material that we license to you, we do not claim ownership of the content you post or provide on the service.
                                                
The service includes public areas available to the general public, shared areas available to others you have selected and personal areas where you have not granted access to others. If you share content with others on the service, in either public or shared areas, then you understand and agree that others with whom you have shared content may use that content. You grant to those members of the public to whom you have permitted access free, nonexclusive permission to use, copy, distribute and display the content solely in connection with the service and other CEC products and services. If you do not want others to have those rights, please do not share your content with them.
                                                
You understand that CEC may need and you hereby authorize CEC to use, modify, copy, distribute and display content posted on the service to the extent necessary to provide the service. This includes:

We will not pay you for your content. We may refuse to publish your content and may remove your content from the service at any time.







8. Privacy.



In order to operate and provide the service, we collect certain information about you. We use and protect that information as described in the CEC Online Privacy Statement, http://www.easycleanenergy.com/privacy. In particular, we may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of CEC or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the service; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of CEC employees, customers or the public.
                                                

The service is a private computer network that CEC operates for the benefit of itself and its customers. CEC retains the right to block or otherwise prevent delivery of any type of email or other communication to or from the service as part of our efforts to protect the service, protect our customers or stop you from breaching these Terms of Use. The technology or other means we use may hinder or break your use of the service. In order to provide you the service, we may collect certain information about service performance, your machine and your service use. We may automatically upload this information from your machine. This data will not be used to personally identify you. You may read about this information collection in more detail in the privacy statement at http://www.easycleanenergy.com/privacy.






9. Software.



If you receive software from us as part of the service, your use of that software is under the terms of the license or subscription that is presented to you for acceptance for that software. We reserve all other rights to the software.
                                                
We may automatically check your version of the software. We may automatically download upgrades to the software to your computer to update, enhance and further develop the service.
                                                
Unless we notify you otherwise, your license to use the software will end on the date your service ends, and you must promptly uninstall the software. We may disable the software after the date the service ends.
                                                
You will not disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any software included in the service, except and only to the extent that the law expressly permits this activity. 






10. How We May Change the Terms of Use. 




If we change this Terms of Use, we will tell you prior to your continued use. If you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the service before the change takes place. If you do not stop using the service, then your continued use of the service will constitute acceptance to the changed Terms of Use. 







11. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY.




We provide the service 'as-is,' 'with all faults' and 'as available.' We do not guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of information available from the service. We and our affiliates, resellers, distributors, partners and vendors (collectively, the 'CEC parties') give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws that this Terms of Use cannot change. We exclude any implied warranties including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort and non-infringement.







12. LIABILITY LIMITATION. 




You can recover from the CEC parties only direct damages up to an amount equal to any amounts, if any, you have paid for the service during the prior 30 days. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental or punitive damages.This limitation applies to anything related to:
                                                
the service,
content (including code) on third-party Internet sites, third-party programs or third-party conduct,
viruses or other disabling features that affect your access to or use of the service,
incompatibility between the service and other services, software and hardware,
delays or failures you may have in initiating, conducting or completing any transmissions or transactions in connection with the service in an accurate or timely manner, and
claims for breach of Terms of Use, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence or other tort.
It also applies even if:
                                                
this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses, or fails of its essential purpose; or
CEC knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your province or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.







13. Suggestions. 




The CEC shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicenseable, irrevocable, perpetual license to the use to incorporate into the services any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by you, relating to the operation of the services.







14. Changes to the Service; If We Cancel the Service; Pre-Release.




We may change the service or delete features at any time and for any reason. We may cancel or suspend your service at any time. Our cancellation or suspension may be without cause and/or without notice. Upon service cancellation, your right to use the service stops right away. Once the service is cancelled or suspended, any data you have stored on the service may not be retrieved later. Our cancellation of the service will not alter your obligation to pay all charges made to your billing account. If we cancel the service in its entirety without cause within the first six years of service, then we will refund to you on a pro-rata basis the amount of any payments that you have made corresponding to the portion of the six years of service. A particular service may be a pre-release version and may not work correctly or in the way a final version might work. There may be interruptions or extended downtimes. We may significantly change the final version or decide not to release a final version at all.







15. Interpreting the Terms of Use.




All parts of this Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. A court may hold that we cannot enforce a part of this Terms of Use as written. If this happens, then you and we will replace that part with terms that most closely match the intent of the part that we cannot enforce. The rest of this Terms of Use will not change. This is the entire Terms of Use between you and us regarding your use of the service. It supersedes any prior Terms of Use or statements regarding your use of the service. If you have confidentiality obligations related to the service, those obligations remain in force (for example, you may have been a beta tester). The section titles in the Terms of Use do not limit the other terms of this Terms of Use.







16. Assignment.




We may assign this Terms of Use, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign this Terms of Use, or any part of it, to any other person without the prior written consent of the CEC. Any attempt by you to do so is void. You may not transfer to anyone else, either temporarily or permanently, any rights to use the service or any part of the service.







17. No Third Party Beneficiaries.




This Terms of Use is solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors and assigns under this Terms of Use.







18. Claim Must Be Filed Within One Year.




Any claim related to this Terms of Use or the service may not be brought unless brought within one year. The one-year period begins on the date when the claim first could be filed. If it is not filed in time, then that claim is permanently barred. This applies to you and your successors. It also applies to us and our successors and assigns.







19. Your Notices to Us.



You may notify us as stated in the customer support or 'Contact' area for the service or our web site at www.easycleanenergy.com. We do not accept e-mail notices.






20. Notices We Send You; Consent Regarding Electronic Information.




This Terms of Use is in electronic form. We have promised to send you certain information in connection with the service and have the right to send you certain additional information. There may be other information regarding the service that the law requires us to send you. We may send you this information in electronic form. You have the right to withdraw this consent, but if you do, we may cancel your service. We may provide required information to you: 

by e-mail at the e-mail address you specified when you signed up for your service;
by access to a CEC web site that will be designated in an e-mail notice sent to you at the time the information is available; or
by access to a CEC web site that will be generally designated in advance for this purpose.

Notices provided to you via e-mail will be deemed given and received on the transmission date of the e-mail. If you do not consent to receive any notices electronically, you must stop using the service. 







21. Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes.




Colorado state law governs the interpretation of this Terms of Use and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

Community Housing Partners








					 				















Welcome to CHPBuilding on a long-standing tradition of environmental, economic and social responsibility, Community Housing Partners (CHP) is a social enterprise that works with private and public partners to design, preserve, construct, manage, and sell award-winning homes in the eastern United States. We also deliver energy conservation training and services across the nation.
Quality housing has value far beyond just the provision of shelter: it improves school performance, diminishes health problems, decreases psychological stress, fosters financial stability, and much more. Through housing, CHP helps build hope and opportunity for senior citizens, formerly-homeless people, single female heads-of-household, and other families and individuals of low-income, empowering them to lead successful lives. At CHP, we do what we do because we have seen the impact that healthy, affordable housing has on strengthening families and revitalizing communities.
As a leader in the community development field, our three primary business segments - Real Estate Development, Energy Solutions and Housing Services -  provide unique integrated service delivery that includes development, architectural design, construction, energy contracting and training, asset management, property management, realty and homeownership, and comprehensive resident services. CHP also shares our experience and expertise by providing fee-for-service options to help like-minded clients maximize their investment while minimizing their environmental impact.

NYS Leads the Nation with Largest Renewable Energy Procurement

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced the Clean Climate Careers Initiative which includes the largest clean energy procurement by a state in U.S. history. The investment of up to $1.5 billion will help New York State reach its goal of 50% of the State’s electricity coming from renewable sources, such as solar and wind, by 2030 and create thousands of clean energy jobs.

                                        Clean Energy Standard


 


 




 


 



 


Up to $2,000 for Electric Vehicles

The Drive Clean Rebate provides New York State drivers with up to $2,000 for the purchase of a qualifying electric vehicle. That means more clean cars on New York roads and fewer harmful emissions.

Building a More Sustainable New York

It starts with the actions that individual communities take to create better places to work and live. The Clean Energy Communities Program recognizes and rewards village, town, city, and county governments in New York State for reducing greenhouse gases and implementing clean energy. This program provides tools, resources, and technical assistance to help local governments implement clean energy actions that can save taxpayer dollars, create jobs, and improve the environment.

Featured Programs

Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Program


Promotes installation of clean, efficient, and commercially available combined heat and power (CHP) systems.

Solar Electric Program (NY-Sun)


Provides incentives and financing to make solar-generated electricity accessible and affordable for all New York State homeowners, renters, and businesses. Using solar can help lower energy costs compared to using conventionally generated electricity. Additional program components include training for installers and public officials, standardized permitting processes, and consumer education.

 


Home Performance with ENERGY STAR®


Offers homeowners in New York State a comprehensive, whole-house approach to improving energy efficiency and home comfort while saving money.

Renewable Heat NY


Supports the installation of high-efficiency, low emission wood heating technology for residential, municipal, and commercial buildings. These advanced technology heating systems enable consumers to use local wood pellets and cordwood as fuel in a cleaner way. Technologies include stoves and pellet and cordwood boilers with thermal storage, many of which are made right here in New York State.
