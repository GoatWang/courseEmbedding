(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like "believe", "expect", "estimate", "anticipate", "intend", "project" and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.  We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  ? have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  ? comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); �  ? submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and  ? disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  Overview  Crypto-Services, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on March 21, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. CRYT is a development-stage Company which intended to offer an information based website at www.digitalcoindaily.com that would provide users with up to date information on the world of digital currencies.  Gordon Hum, the Company's director, President, Treasurer, Secretary, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and holder of 3,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock representing approximately 45.16% of the Company's issued and outstanding securities, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which he agreed to sell to twelve unrelated third parties all of his securities of the Company, for aggregate cash consideration of $35,000. On the same day, Edwin Jong, the Company's director, Vice President and holder of 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock representing approximately 19.35% of the Company's issued and outstanding securities, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which he agreed to sell to five unrelated third parties all of his securities of the Company, for aggregate cash consideration of $15,000. In connection with the sales of the Company's securities, Gordon Hum and Edwin Jong resigned from all of their positions with the Company effective August 3, 2016. Concurrently, Xinlong Shen was appointed to serve as the sole director, President, Treasurer, Secretary, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Effective December 14, 2016, Company accepted the resignation of Xinlong Shen from the position of President, Secretary and Treasurer. He will remain on the Board as a director. Also effective December 14, 2016, the Company appointed Yumin Lin as the new President, Secretary and Treasurer. He will also serve as a director.  Effective August 28, 2016, shareholders of Crypto Services, Inc. representing 54.19% of the Company's issued stock approved changing the Company's name from Crypto-Services, Inc., to Fortune Valley Treasures, Inc. The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada on September 21, 2016. However, the name change is subject to the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Thus, the Company currently is still using Crypto-Services, Inc. as its company name.  Effective December 14, 2016, Crypto-Services, Inc. (the "Company") has accepted the resignation of Xinlong Shen from the position of President, Secretary and Treasurer. He will remain on the Board as a Director.  Also effective December 14, 2016, the company announced the appointment of Yumin Lin to the Board of Directors in the position of President, Secretary and Treasurer. He will also serve as a Director.  We have had limited operations and have been issued a "going concern" opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations.  Plan of Operation  We are a development stage entity devoting substantially all of our efforts to establishing a new business for which our planned principal operations have not yet commenced. We believe our current equity at risk is sufficient to finance our current activities.  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016.This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we launch our business platform. There is no assurance we will ever reach this point. Accordingly, we must raise cash from other sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others or loans from our shareholders or officers. We have no assurances that such loans will become available upon acceptable terms when the funds are required for our operations.  Results of Operations Our operating results for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the table below. Three Months Ended November 30, 2016 2015 Revenue $ - $ - General and administrative $ 18,554 $ 25,125 Net Loss $ (8,054 ) $ (25,125 )  Revenues  Our revenue during the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses amounted to $18, 554 during the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 which comprised of general and administrative costs. For the three-month period ended November 30, 2015, our operation expenses amounted to $25,125. The decrease in the current period is due to the fact that we incurred less general and administrative costs.  Capital Resources and Liquidity Working Capital November 30, 2016 August 31, 2016 Current Assets $ 5,493 $ 8,833 Current Liabilities $ 27,864 $ 23,150 Working Capital (Deficit) $ (22,371 ) $ (14,317 )  Cash Flows For the Three Months Ended, November 30, 2016 November 30, 2015 Net cash used in operating activities $ (15,000 ) $ (25,125 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ - $ - Net cash provided by financing activities $ 15,000 $ - Net change in cash $ - $ (25,125 )  Net cash used in operations was $15,000 for the three-months period ended November 30, 2016 compared to $25,125 for the period ended November 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses of $6,571 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to that ended November 30, 2015.  Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the period ended November 30, 2016 and the period ended November 30, 2015.  Cash flows provided by financing activities for the period ended November 30, 2016 were $15,000 compared to $0 for the period ended November 30, 2015. During the period ended November 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $15,000 from its then-CEO, Xinlong Shen. As of November 30, 2016, the Company was indebted to Xinlong Shen in the amount of $18,000, which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.  We have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of November 30, 2016, we had $0 in cash. Based upon our current business plans, we will need considerable cash investments to be successful. Such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and what we currently have commitment for. Therefore, we do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next twelve (12) months.  Anticipated Cash Requirements  We will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through, equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.  We anticipate that our cash expenses over the next 12 months (beginning November 2016) will be approximately $50,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.   Description Estimated Expenses Legal and accounting fees $ 34,000 Marketing and advertising - Investor relations and capital raising - Management and operating costs - Salaries and consulting fees 15,000 General and administrative expenses 1,000 Total $ 50,000  Our general and administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and general office expenses. The professional fees are related to our regulatory filings throughout the year and include legal, accounting and auditing fees.  Based on our planned expenditures, we will require approximately $50,000 to proceed with our business plan over the next 12 months. As of November 30, 2016, we had $0 cash on hand. If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will not be able to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available financial resources.  We intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months from private placements, shareholder loans or possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer). If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time we do not have a commitment from any broker-dealer to provide us with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.  Even though we plan to raise capital through equity or debt financing, we believe that the latter may not be a viable alternative for funding our operations as we do not have sufficient tangible assets to secure any such financing. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to finance our operations. In the absence of such financing, we may be forced to abandon our business plan.  Going Concern  During the period ended November 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Off-balance sheet arrangements  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the Company's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Agribusiness Technology Solutions        Report a Bug      Give Feedback          Technical Chart        When first displayed, a Technical Chart contains six months' worth of Daily price activity with the open, high, low, and close for each bar presented in a display box above the chart. Each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart. The vertical bars below the chart represent Volume and are color-coded to indicate market activity for the day:  An up day (where the price is greater than the previous price) will show a green bar. A down day (where the price is less than the previous price) will show a red bar. When the price is unchanged compared to the previous price, Volume will show as a blue bar.  On futures charts, the horizontal purple line above the Volume bars represents Open Interest. Technical Charts have the option to create Spread Charts , with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads (such as Corn 1-2, Soybeans Crush, and Wheat Butterfly), or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation (supporting all futures, equities, index and forex symbols). Chart Settings A chart form resides below the chart. This is where you can change the symbol, style, time frame, and other chart settings. If you are logged in to your My Barchart account, you will also see a drop-down list for any Chart Templates you've previously saved. Simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart. Basic Chart  Bar Type - choose from OHLC Bars, Candlesticks, Hollow Candlesticks, Line or Area Volume On - displays or hides the volume for the symbol. Time Frame - determines the period (Frequency) and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart (Time Period and Start/End Dates).  For Frequency, choose from Intraday, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. for Commodity Contracts, you may also select a chart for the Contract, Nearest Futures Contract, or a Continuation chart Nearest Futures and Continuation Charts Commodity charts have three additional frequencies for Daily, Weekly and Monthly data: Contract, Nearest, and Continuation.  Daily/Weekly/Monthly Contract will plot prices for that specific contract   Daily/Weekly/Monthly Nearest Futures will use whatever contract was the Nearest Futures contract on the date of the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar Daily/Weekly/Monthly Continuation Chart will always use the same MONTH specified in the chart form to build the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used (in this case, December, or Z)  The information is back-dated to the start of the period, so on a 5-minute chart information in the period dated 12:45 includes all trades between 12:45 and 12:49 inclusive. A trade at 13:00 would be included within the next bar dated 13:00.     A default Time Period is set based on your Frequency setting. For example, an Intraday chart will use a Time Period of 3 Days, while a Daily chart uses a Time Period of 6 Months. You may change the Time Period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart. The longer the time frame, the closer together the individual bars. The shorter the time frame, the more distance between the bars. You may override or further define the Time Period, or generate a historical chart, by entering a Start and End Date for the data. For example, you can get a Daily chart with 6 months of data from one year ago by entering an End Date from one year back.     Display Settings - further define what the chart will look like.  Price Box - when checked, displays a "Data View" window as you mouse-over the chart, showing OHLC for the bar, and all indicator values for the given bar.  Price Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows prices. % Change Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open. Linear Scale - when on, scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high, the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales. Logarithmic Scale - when on, uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling.    Spread Chart Spread Charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations. You may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers, or by entering your own custom spread expression. The calculated results are displayed as a line chart. Expression: shows the calculation used to create the chart. When you select a Common Spread from the drop-down list, or when you create a Futures Spread using the fields on the form, the Expression is built automatically for you.  If you want to create your own custom Expression, you can enter the calculation directly into the Expression field. Valid syntax for an Expression calculation includes the use of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) between each leg. Calculations are performed from left to right, unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses. Examples:  IBM-DELL subtracts the last price of DELL from IBM. 2*IBM+DELL multiplies IBM by two, then adds the price of DELL. 2*DELL/3+IBM multiplies DELL by two, then divides by three, then adds IBM. (2*DELL)/(3+IBM) multiplies DELL by two, then divides the result by the sum of three plus IBM. $DXY-$SPX subtracts the S&P 500 Index from the Dollar Index. ^USDCAD+^CADAUD adds the Canadian Dollar/Australian Dollar to the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar.  Note for Futures Contracts: Barchart's charting application commonly uses the * symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month. For example, ZC*1 will return the front month, ZC*2 returns the second month out, ZC*3 returns the third month out, etc. When creating a custom expression using futures contracts, you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression:  (ZC*1+ZC*2+ZC*3)/3 will add the front, second and third months for Corn, then divide the result by three. (ZCZ0+ZCH11+ZCK11)/3 will add December 2010 Corn, March 2011 Corn and May 2011 Corn together, then divide the results by three. (ZC*1)*2+(ZC*3)*2 will multiply the front month for Corn by 2, then add the result to the (third month out for Corn multiplied by two). ZC*2*4 will take the second month out for Corn and multiply the price by 4.   Common Spreads: choose from a number of common commodity spreads. (the expression will be displayed once you've made a selection from the list.)  Create a Futures Spread: select up to three different commodities, including the month, year, multiplier and function (+ - / *) between the second and third leg. The expression will be built and displayed in the Expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread.   Comparison Chart  Select up to three symbols to compare against. This will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed. To produce a chart of percent changes between symbols, check the Percent Change box. The colors of the boxes (green, purple, red) indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol. You may also indicate whether to display that symbol's price scale on the left side of the chart (by default, prices will all display on the right side). Studies / Parameters Select the indicators you wish to add to the chart. To remove an indicator, click the red "delete" icon. To change an indicator's parameters, click on the indicator name.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Item 1A. Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in this Form 10-K. We use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.  Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Overview  Crypto-Services, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on March 21, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. CRYT is a development-stage Company which intended to offer an information based website at www.digitalcoindaily.com that would provide users with up to date information on the world of digital currencies.  Upon the consummation of the sale, a change of control occurred with Gordon Hum and Edwin Jong appointing Xinlong Shen as the designee of the Purchasers to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Sole Director of the Company. Mr. Hum and Mr. Jong resigned from all of their positions with the Company. A Form 8-K was filed with the Securities Commission reflecting this change of officers and directors.  Effective August 28, 2016, shareholders of Crypto Services, Inc. representing 54.19% of the Company's issued stock approved changing the Company's name from Crypto-Services, Inc., to Fortune Valley Treasures, Inc. The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada on September 21, 2016.  We have had limited operations and have been issued a "going concern" opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations.  Plan of Operation  We are a development stage entity devoting substantially all of our efforts to establishing a new business for which our planned principal operations have not yet commenced. We believe our current equity at risk is sufficient to finance our current activities.  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016.This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we launch our business platform. There is no assurance we will ever reach this point. Accordingly, we must raise cash from other sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others or loans from our shareholders or officers. We have no assurances that such loans will become available upon acceptable terms when the funds are required for our operations.  Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form 10-K.  For the Fiscal Years Ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015  Revenue  For the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 we generated no revenue.  Operating Expense  Operating expense decreased to $44,465 for the year ended August 31, 2016 as compared with $45,590 for the year ended August 31, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in general and administrative expenses due to accounting, legal and consulting expenses.  Net loss  Net loss decreased to $23,336 for the year ended August 31, 2016 as compared with $45,590 for the year ended August 31, 2015. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in operating expenses and gain on waive of liability of approximately $22,254.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   For the Years Ended August 31, 2016 2015 Net cash used in operating activities $ (42,492 ) $ (35,008 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ - $ - Net cash provided by financing activities $ - $ 27,500  Net cash used in operations was $42,492 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 compared to $35,008 for the year ended August 31, 2015.  Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 and for the year ended August 31, 2015.  Cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 were $0 compared to $27,500 for the year ended August 31, 2015.  We have substantial capital resource requirements and have incurred significant losses since inception. As of August 31, 2016, we had $0 in cash. Based upon our current business plans, we will need considerable cash investments to be successful. Such capital requirements are in excess of what we have in available cash and what we currently have commitment for. Therefore, we do not have enough available cash to meet our obligations over the next twelve (12) months.  Related Party Transactions  Since inception, we have conducted transactions with directors and director related entities. These transactions included the following:  During the fiscal year of 2016, the Company was indebted to the Prior President of the Company in the amount of $1,741, which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.  On August 8, 2016, the former President, Gordon Hum confirmed that there were no trade payables, accrued expenses, liabilities, taxes, obligations or commitments prior to August 8, 2016 ,which would be required to accrue or be reflected in in the financial statements. Additionally, he confirmed that he has waived any and all such liabilities as of August 8, 2016.  As of August 31, 2016, the Company was indebted to the current CEO, Xinlong Shen, in the amount of $3,000, which is non-interest bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.  Lily Chen, friend of Xinlong Shen, provided non-compensated book keeping and financial reporting services from August, 2016 to December, 2016.  Effective August 31, 2016 the Company agreed to assign and transfer all of its existing assets and liabilities to former Company president Gordon Hum. In consideration for the assignment of the Company's assets and liabilities, Mr. Hum agreed to retire any and all shares of preferred stock of the Company for return to treasury. Pursuant to the assignment of the assets and liabilities to Gordon Hum, the Company agreed to deliver to Mr. Hum any documentary evidence of the full and unrestricted title to the assets and liabilities, and such other documents as may be required under applicable law or reasonably requested by Mr. Hum. Effective October 18, 2016, the Company delivered to Mr. Hum the required documentary evidence of the full and unrestricted title to the assets and liabilities and Mr. Hum delivered to the Company the full documentary evidence of the retirement of the Preferred Stock to treasury.  Going Concern Qualification  We did not generate any revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 or the period ended August 31, 2015 and have incurred significant losses and cash used in operations, and such losses and use of cash are expected to continue. During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $69,167. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a "Going Concern Qualification" in their report for the year ended August 31, 2016 and the period from inception through August 31, 2015. In addition, we have negative working capital. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans include seeking additional capital or debt financing. There is no guarantee that additional capital or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to us. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The "Going Concern Qualification" might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital.  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
