Rating Action: Moody's affirms AXIS's ratings following Novae acquisition announcement; outlook stable






                    Global Credit Research - 06 Jul 2017
                









New York, July 06, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings of AXIS Capital Holdings 
Limited (NYSE: AXS, Baa3(hyb) preferred stock) and its subsidiaries, 
including the guaranteed senior debt of its finance subsidiaries (Baa1 
senior) and the insurance financial strength of its operating subsidiaries 
(A2 financial strength, see complete ratings list below) following 
the company's announcement that it has entered into an agreement 
to acquire Novae Group plc (LSE: NVA, Novae -- not rated) 
and its associated Lloyds syndicates for $604 million in cash. 
The rating outlook for AXIS is stable.




AXIS has agreed to acquire Novae for GBP 7.00 per Novae common 
share, and the purchase price represents an approximately 20% 
premium to Novae's closing price on 4 July 2017. The consideration 
will consist of cash, although AXIS has indicated that the company 
may consider partial debt financing if conditions are favorable. 
The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2017 subject to regulatory 
approvals in various jurisdictions.




RATINGS RATIONALE 




In affirming AXIS ratings, Moody's said that the proposed acquisition 
of Novae has strategic benefits for AXIS as it would significantly expand 
AXIS' Lloyds presence, making AXIS a top 10 Lloyd's 
insurer. Novae has a good presence in specialty lines of business 
including marine hull and liability, energy and cyber liability. 
The acquisition will also incrementally boost AXIS' profitability. 
However, Moody's views the transaction overall as credit negative, 
given expected increases in operational leverage coupled with higher catastrophe 
risk, although we expect AXIS to reduce catastrophe exposure over 
time. The acquisition also carries integration and execution risks 
and incrementally increases AXIS's goodwill and intangibles. 
In addition, margins in specialty insurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
(and the Lloyds market more broadly) are expected to remain under pressure 
given heightened competition. 




According to Moody's, AXIS' ratings are based on the company's 
select underwriting strengths in a diversified mix of specialty insurance 
and reinsurance businesses; historically solid operating returns; 
the company's solid reserve position and high quality fixed income 
portfolio. These strengths are tempered by: cyclical and 
structural factors in the reinsurance market, which have reduced 
AXIS' ex-catastrophe returns; exposure to specialty 
lines of business, which inherently carry more risk compared to 
conventional insurance lines; focus on professional liability and 
other casualty lines of business heightens vulnerability to reserve volatility 
and changes in the legal environment; meaningful catastrophe exposure 
including terrorism risk; and, high dependence on three insurance 
brokers, which exposes the company to distribution risks.




Due to structural challenges in a highly competitive reinsurance sector, 
an upgrade for AXIS is unlikely in the next 24 months.




The following factors could lead to a downgrade of AXIS' ratings: 
1) long term ability to earn cost of capital is compromised; 2) EBIT 
coverage of fixed charges falls below 5x in consecutive years (reflecting 
actual rather than normalized cat losses); 3) debt-to-capital 
ratio consistently above 25%, including 50% of preferred 
shares treated as debt; 4) reduction in total shareholders' equity 
by more than 10% over a rolling twelve month period due to share 
buybacks, losses, or any other reason; or 5) unexpectedly 
large losses in proof-of-concept or non-core product 
lines.

REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

AXIS, a DataX Company, Unveils New Retail Specialty Finance Product

		  Replaces paper-based loan application processes for brick and mortar facilities
		

Oct 28, 2011, 08:00 ET
		  		  														
						 from   AXIS 











 
















































 

 




















 


SUNRISE, Fla., Oct. 28, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, AXIS (www.AXISLLC.com), Application Xpress Information Systems, a cloud-based solutions provider for the specialty finance industry, unveiled its latest solution, Automated Completion Expert (A.C.E.), a web-based loan application solution that replaces paper-based loan application processes frequently found in brick and mortar facilities.
"A.C.E. optimizes operational performance for retail payday lenders by eliminating paper applications and manual data entry processes," said Nanette Leonard, Executive Vice President of DataX.  "By streamlining the process, lenders will improve the customer experience, increase visibility to fraudulent activity, and maximize profitability."
AXIS works collaboratively with each client to review its current application process and seamlessly integrate the automated solution. A.C.E. is available to any facility with a computer and web access. The automated solution uses publicly available data to pre-populate electronic loan applications. Then it automatically inserts the loan application data into the storefront's Loan Management System (LMS) — eliminating the need for loan officers to manually enter the application data into the LMS.
"Backed by the expertise of DataX, AXIS has the knowhow and the innovative technology to keep improving operational processes for the specialty finance industry," said Stacy Hallman, Vice President of Operations at AXIS. "We will work with partners to boost employee efficiency, save valuable time by eliminating errors associated with manual data entry, and ensure data accuracy, all while reducing fraud and loan defaults."
AXIS is currently at the 23rd Annual FiSCA Conference & Exposition (www.fisca.org) in Grande Lakes Orlando.

AXIS, Application Xpress Information Systems, is a cloud computing company that provides turn-key solutions for retail and online payday lenders. The company's solutions and consulting and data services enable businesses to increase efficiencies and security by automating manual processes and enhance their customer experience, all while reducing exposure to fraud. 
AXIS is a subsidiary of DataX. For more information, visit www.AXISLLC.com.
