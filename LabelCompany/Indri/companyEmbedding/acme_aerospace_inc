Lithium Batteries















Acme Aerospace Inc. is on the forefront of advanced battery, chargers and battery management system design. Our unique in-house capabilities and experience allows us a distinct approach to Li-Ion batteries with a focus on safety, performance, reliability and system integration.  Acme is currently the battery supplier of choice of the Sikorsky S-97 RAIDER platform and is a team sponsor under Avionic Instruments LLC.
 
It is extremely important when considering the use of Li-Ion battery systems for airborne applications to consider its performance parameters, environment and how the battery is expected to integrate with the rest of the electrical system architecture, especially the charger and battery management system.  These issues must be addressed and overcome on any platform in order to satisfy the current FAA Special Conditions Safety Criteria established by the authorities.
 
Acme’s smart Lithium-Ion battery system contains a balance between power density (reduced weight) and the necessary levels of redundant safety features to ensure fault isolation and avoid propagation failure. The engineers at Acme have evaluated all available chemistry options for Lithium-Ion cells and have identified multiple reliable sources for the different chemistries. Lithium Iron Phosphate has been chosen due to its thermal stability characteristics and overall safety. The battery system design includes the cells, charger, battery management system (BMS) and associated electronics to maintain the battery in a charged condtion and provide power when required for engine starting.  The function of the BMS is to monitor, evaluate and protect the lithium chemistry cells
 
Acme Aerospace’s Li-Ion Battery System consists of the following components:
 
1. Lithium Ion Battery – The arrangement of cells is dependent on the technical parameters of the specified battery, but all cells are arranged in a physical configuration utilizing specific thermal materials to prevent cell failure propagation.
 
2. Battery Charger: The charger converts the unregulated 28 VDC input into a constant current -constant voltage (CC/CV) output to charge the battery.
 
3. Battery Management System (BMS):  The BMS provides full protection for the battery in the case of over-voltage, under-voltage and over-temperature conditions.  The BMS also controls the series cell balancing is achieved using a microcontroller.

Acme Aerospace





INTRODUCTION
 
Acme Aerospace has an extensive history in the design and manufacture of emergency backup batteries, battery chargers, and battery assemblies.  Advanced concepts in power conversion lead to significant weight savings over the competition.


RELATED EXPERIENCE
 
Expertise in charge control design has resulted in Acme receiving development contracts for chargers to accompany lead-acid, sealed lead-acid, vented Nickel Cadmium, sealed Nickel Cadmium sealed Fiber Nickel Cadmium batteries, Nickel Metal Hydride and Lithium Ion.
 
Acme Aerospace possesses over 30 years experience in the custom design and manufacturing of AC/DC and DC/DC converters.  Acme’s reputation has been built by thousands of converters and charge control units successfully flying on both military and commercial aircraft around the world.


“ZERO MAINTENANCE” SEALED FIBER NICKEL CADMIUM (FNC) BATTERY SYSTEM
 
In addition, Acme has developed and manufactures the sealed Fiber Nickel Cadmium (FNC) Battery System supporting the world’s only battery which is in use on the Boeing 777, Apache AH-64D, MD-90, Apache AH64A, and F-16 Falcon.
 
Acme can also provide main battery chargers for all battery technologies.


EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER SUPPLY HISTORY
 
Acme established itself as a leader in emergency backup batteries with the release of its Airborne Modular Power Supply (AMPS).  The AMPS family leveraged off the reduced weight of sealed Nickel Cadmium cells coupled with an internal charger and controller.
 
Typically selected in applications where duty cycle and weight were critical, Acme has produced In excess of 5,000 units.  Acme utilizes cylindrical NiCad technology for our AMPS-500 supplies 50 watts for 30 minutes, the AMPS-1000 supplies 100 watts for 30 minutes, and the AMPS-2000 is 200 watts for 30 minutes. We also offer our AMPS-2000XL which utilizes a cylindrical Sealed Lead Acid technology with the same specifications as our AMPS-2000.


PROPRIETARY DESIGNS
 
Acme Aerospace will provide all drawings, specifications, and process descriptions required for customer qualification of Acme Aerospace designs.  Acme's present quality procedures will ensure any documentation submitted for qualification and/or process evaluation shall be adequate for customer’s evaluation and for Acme Aerospace’s production needs.  Acme Aerospace may require that the customer for some proprietary design documentation release approve a nondisclosure statement.  Acme Aerospace will correct any and all workmanship and/or design deficiencies found during the qualification.  All drawings and specifications effected by such changes shall be completed prior to production hardware build.
 
This procedure is managed by the use of internal design reviews.  However, by our use of design of experiments during the prototype phase, minimal changes should be required as a result of qualification.  Acme Aerospace shall conduct complete first article inspection of all purchased and manufactured parts for qualification units per quality procedure, “First Article Inspection-Procured.”

Acne & Pimples 
















Breakouts: Acne & Pimples










 









Who’s afraid of a breakout? Not you! Get to know your skin’s worst enemy and show those pimples who’s boss.
What causes acne and pimples?
Pimples can form when your skin makes too much oil. Pores get clogged with this excess build-up of oil and dead skin cells, which allows bacteria to breed, causing redness and swelling.
What’s the difference between a pimple and acne?
Some people get a pimple or two once in a while, while others get frequent breakouts with lots of pus-filled pimples. If the second sounds more like you, you may have acne – a chronic or long-term condition that affects many teens and adults. But don’t panic, there are many effective treatments that help keep acne under control.
What about bacne, also known as body or back acne?
If you have this, you’re not alone – it can affect many people! Like face acne, bacne can form when your pores get clogged by excess oil and dead skin cells, allowing bacteria to grow. Sometimes, wearing tight clothes and using heavy backpacks can irritate the skin and make bacne worse. You can treat it the same way you would treat acne on your face.
What foods cause acne? Do greasy food and chocolate make me break out?
No. But some refined carbs like white bread, pasta, chips and cornflakes might actually make breakouts worse if you already have them.
Will tanning clear up my acne?
Tanning salons don't actually affect your acne. However, they can potentially cause skin cancer and wrinkles.
Will squeezing pimples make them go away?
Not exactly. Aside from giving you scars, squeezing or popping pimples spreads bacteria, which can make your zits worse.
Then how do I get rid of acne or pimples?
Cleansers, creams and gels with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide should do the trick. The CLEAN & CLEAR ADVANTAGE® line has a range of pimple-fighting products.
