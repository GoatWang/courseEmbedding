Welcome to Capital Investment Advisors

Capital Investment Advisors ("CIA") is a leading owner, operator and developer of office, industrial, retail and residential real estate in the Washington Metropolitan area. Headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, CIA focuses on strategic investment, development and management in both high barrier-to-entry and high growth markets within Washington Metropolitan area. CIA provides to its capital partners a full array of co-invested real estate services including: acquisition/disposition, development/construction management, property management, asset management and financial reporting services.
Since CIA's inception in the early 1990’s, the company has deployed nearly $500 million in total capitalization, CIA's portfolio ranges from unentitled land to value-add and core-plus, cash-flowing assets. CIA successfully, and continually, partners with institutional investors, including publicly held companies, family office principals, private equity funds, and high net worth investors.
For over 20 years Capital Investment Advisors (CIA) has been actively engaged in the Washington Metropolitan area real estate industry. Capital Investment Advisors owns, develops and manages a broad portfolio of multifamily rental communities, residential land for development, commercial office and industrial buildings as well as several ground-up development and construction ventures as the market affords. CIA is primarily focused on opportunistic value acquisitions where our skill as general contractors for renovation and owner focused value-add strategies can generate above market risk/return opportunities. CIA is also very focused on the acquisition of “interim use” assets where the long history of rezoning, subdivision and entitlement expertise can generate substantial investment positions. The company's financial goals are to secure superior risk adjusted returns within their market place and to create long term value through these various disciplines. We invest our own equity into our ventures and look for similarly long term value investors as partners in these investments.
We are committed to creating value for our own equity positions and align these goals with the interests of our financial partners, while maintaining the highest degree of integrity and mitigating as much near term risk as possible through debt and equity structuring.

  1 HOW THE BONUS WORKSYou have two steps to qualify for your cash bonus. First, open a new online Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or Individual, Joint or Custodial account on capitaloneinvesting.com using promo code XCOFW60017 by the promotion expiration date: 01/31/2018. (The promotion is not valid for Capital One Advisors Managed Portfolio accounts or accounts opened through a financial advisor.) You must have a U.S. Tax I.D. (Social Security number) to open a Capital One Investing, LLC, account. Second, make a net deposit, transfer, and/or rollover that posts to your new account within 90 days of opening your account. Your net qualifying assets posted during that 90-day period must be at least $5,000 to be eligible for a $50 bonus, $15,000 for a $100 bonus, $50,000 for a $200 bonus, $100,000 for a $300 bonus, or $200,000 for a $600 bonus. If your net qualifying assets are within $100 of a higher bonus level, you will be credited at that level so you receive a larger bonus. Your net qualifying assets are the total amounts of your deposits and transfers, minus any withdrawals. (Note: the qualifying asset amount isn't affected by any change in value for your securities after they were deposited.) Transfers from an existing online Capital One Investing account, or from a Capital One 360® IRA to an online Capital One Investing IRA, do not qualify. Promotion is non-transferable, not valid for ESAs, and not valid with any other promotion. Limit one bonus per customer or custodial beneficiary.
WHEN YOU GET YOUR BONUSCapital One Investing will add the bonus to your account within 5-7 business days following the 90-day period. The bonus is not available for withdrawal for 180 days after it is awarded to your account. Qualifying assets must remain in the account (minus any losses related to trading or market volatility) for at least 9 months following the 90-day period or your bonus may be reclaimed. Bonus may be refused or recovered if it is determined that you violated Capital One Investing's Account Agreement. 
TAXES & YOUR BONUSAny applicable taxes related to Capital One Investing Offers are the responsibility of the account holder. To the extent required by law, Capital One will report the total value of the bonus with respect to a non-IRA investment account to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the applicable tax year in which it is paid. Account holders should consult a tax or legal advisor to determine the appropriate tax treatment of this bonus for tax purposes.
For traditional and Roth IRAs, the bonus is a cash award that will be deposited directly into the account holder's IRA and treated the same as investment earnings in the account. The bonus will not be reported to the IRS as an IRA contribution and will be reported when distributed on Form 1099-R the same as the remainder of your IRA balance. Account holders should consult their tax or legal advisor about the treatment of earnings in IRAs, guidelines on IRS contribution limits, and the appropriate tax treatment for this bonus before accepting the bonus.

Each entrant submitted an essay detailing accomplishments since January 1, 2014, as well as a biography of the leader of the department or team being considered for an award. Winners were determined by two independent reviews conducted by ABA Stevie Awards staff approved volunteer judges in April and May of 2013, 2014 and 2015. At least five judges participated in the first round and members of specialized committees judged the second round. First round judges assigned ratings to entrants in each category using a scale of 1-10. Entrants with scores of at least 7.0 were deemed Finalists, and were rated by the second round judges. The Finalist with the highest score in each category received the Gold Stevie. Finalists in each category with an average score of at least 8.0 received a Silver Stevie and all other Finalists in each category received a Bronze Stevie.

CAPITAL INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES
Capital Investment Advisory Services, LLC provides a platform for those investment advisory representatives who choose to manage their own client accounts.

CIAS was created around the vision that independent financial advisors are best served when they are empowered with the capability to seamlessly integrate fee and commission-based services for their end clients.
CIAS attracts investment advisors who, if they chose to establish their own registered investment advisory firm, would normally have to deal with the complexities of multiple state registrations or those who do not have the desire to dedicate staff and resources to RIA maintenance. The association with Capital Investment Group, Inc, the broker/dealer, also gives our financial professionals the ability to offer products and services in a true hybrid business model serving clients on either a fee or commission basis.
CIAS advisors may pursue their own individual business models while offloading growing regulatory complexity and costs to their back office.
We offer our IARs the maximum flexibility of multiple custodial partners typically associated only with RIA firm ownership. We make available a comprehensive platform of products, trading and technology systems, as well as customized wealth management and practice management solutions.
Additionally, CIAS offers top-of-the-line resources such as portfolio management and performance reporting technology, as well as professionally developed mutual fund and ETF models for those advisors who choose to focus their efforts on meeting the needs of their clients instead of continually staying on top of the analytics of account management.
CIAS advisors can leverage our extensive experience in the hybrid space, and take comfort in knowing we manage the significant challenges of compliance and regulatory changes.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
