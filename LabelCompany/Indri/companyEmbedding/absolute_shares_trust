The ETF industry has gained immense popularity over the past two decades, growing by leaps and bounds. There are currently over 1,600 exchange traded products listed in the U.S., with almost $1.9 trillion in assets under management.
	Attracted by this popularity, new players are joining this space with the latest -being the Absolute Shares Trust, the ETF arm of Millington Securities. The issuer has recently launched 10 new actively managed ETFs that are to be sub advised by WBI Investments, an affiliate of Millington Securities.
	As per the SEC filing, the newly launched funds seek to follow an absolute return approach to investment management, seeking to provide attractive returns, while minimizing volatility and risk (read:3 Ultra Safe Bond ETFs to Dodge Market Turmoil).

Moreover, the fund follows a strict stop loss approach and sells a particular security if its price falls below a particular acceptable price range.
	The products will invest in multiple asset classes including domestic and foreign securities, as well as equities (such as common stocks, preferred stocks, rights, warrants, convertibles, ETFs and MLPs) and debts (such as U.S. and foreign treasuries, junk bonds and ETNs) (read: New Active Multi-Asset ETF to Ride Out Current Turmoil).

Absolute Shares Trust(NYSE:WBII): Fixed Income, Active Style | ETF Daily News

































 





























































For Diversified Fixed Income Exposure, Check Out This Actively Managed ETF


 November 29, 2016 1:11pm  NYSE:WBII  



 




Red Bank, New Jersey-based WBI Shares offers a suite of actively managed ETFs. Let’s take a deeper look at their most popular offering the space, WBII (WBI Tactical Income Shares, Expense Ratio 1.05%).




WBII currently sits at $316 million in assets under management presently, ranking it as the sixth largest “Multi-Asset” fund in that specific category behind ETFs such as MDIV (First Trust Multi-Asset Diversified Income, Expense Ratio 0.67%, $856 million in AUM), AOR (iShares Core Growth Allocation, Expense Ratio 0.24%, $851 million in AUM) and several other iShares “Allocation” funds in spite of seeing some mild outflows year-to-date ($20 million out).
WBII debuted in late August of 2014 so it still falls short of its three year anniversary. Once it hits the three-year mark, the fund will earn a Morningstar ranking, which has proven important in the past in the “Actively Managed” ETF segment, from what we have seen.
WBII is a “Fund of Funds” in the sense that it invests in other ETFs within its investment methodology, as we can see from current fund literature that top holdings in the fund include fixed income ETFs from iShares, Vanguard, PowerShares, SPDRs, and PIMCO for example. Fund literature states that the investment mandate is:
“To provide investors with a wealth-building investment strategy that provides low volatility, low correlation, and an optimal blend of bear market capital preservation and bull market return. The Fund is active in an effort to reduce risk to protect capital, and tactical in an attempt to find the best global investment opportunities. WBII typically invests in income-producing debt and equity securities of foreign and domestic companies.”
Presently we see the asset class breakdown inside of WBII as heavily favoring U.S. Fixed Income securities, with 58% of the portfolio residing there, followed by lesser allocations to U.S. listed equities (16%), International Fixed Income securities (12%), Cash (7%), and Preferred Stocks (6%).
