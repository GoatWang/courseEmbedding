During my time there Sterling was in the process of evaluating their strategic goals. The Executive management team worked hard to teach and promote these new goals to all employees. They used many different communication techniques to lift morale and to make sure all employees understood the companies new strategic plan and each worked to implement the strategic plan. Everyone worked together.ConsSterling was in the process of determining how to proceed in a difficult business environment and industry that had it's unique set of challenges. Change was constant and many factors effected business month to month.Advice to ManagementBe prepared to think outside the box in a difficult business and industry where change is constant. Define corporate strategic goals and the challenges which seem to be constant. Monthly performance and planning meetings to determine what changes need to be made to keep the business growing.
