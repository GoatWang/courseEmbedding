Joseph Burnett Company, Boston, MA

Posted on May 28, 2015 by Jessica  

The Joseph Burnett Company’s claim to fame was a useful innovation in the production of vanilla extract. Unlike most of his competitors, having graduated from the Worcester College of Pharmacy, Burnett stands out as one of the few fully qualified proprietors certified as a pharmacist. In this capacity he played a role in the first painless dental surgery publicly performed using ether, as well as producing a string of less effective products, which include a cocaine product to “stimulate healthy and vigorous hair growth.” He also seems to have been a progressive guy, who founded an Episcopal church in Boston that was “free to all, with no distinctions as to wealth, color, race or station.”
Bottle embossed “Burnett’s Standard Flavoring Extracts”

According to the Southborough Historical Society,  “The Joseph Burnett Company unofficially began in 1847 when druggist/chemist, Joseph Burnett developed a vanilla extract for flavoring foods. At the time, he was a partner with Theodore Metcalf, a Boston druggist. Joseph Burnett began as an apprentice to Theodore Metcalf in 1837, shortly after graduating from the Worcester College of Pharmacy. In 1845, at age 25, he became a full partner of the newly named Metcalf and Burnett Chemical Company. Before long, he earned a reputation for selling only products of the purist quality. In 1848 Joseph married Josephine Cutter and they had 12 children.
Although famous for developing a vanilla extract, Joseph Burnett also had a role in the first publicly demonstrated use of ether to conduct a painless surgery. Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, a Boston dentist, was experimenting with the use of ether as an anesthetic at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He had poor results and realized the ether he was using was impure. Another doctor (Charles T. Jackson) told him to buy all of his drugs from Joseph Burnett to insure their purity. Dr. Morton bought his ether from Joseph Burnett and performed the first successful painless operation on October 16, 1846.
In 1847 a prominent lady and wife of a wealthy Boston manufacturer who had lived some years in France, entered the store of Joseph Burnett. She said she was very anxious to procure a vanilla flavor for her creams, sauces and desserts, such as she had been getting in Paris. At that time the only extract of any kind in this country for flavoring purposes was a cheap extract of lemon. A few French chefs used the vanilla bean itself. This was the clumsy, unsanitary and inconvenient way these chefs got their vanilla flavoring; they would purchase one or two vanilla beans, cut them up and put them in a linen bag, ready to use like a tea ball, to flavor whatever was required. The results from this tedious, inexact method of extracting the flavor were of course very unsatisfactory. When the bag was first used it would give the delicious flavor of pure vanilla, but afterwards, when it became diluted, the taste was weak and unpalatable. It was never uniform in strength or flavor. It was always expensive because the full rich flavor could never be thoroughly extracted.
Mr. Burnett listened to the lady’s description of the flavoring she wanted. This extraordinary request challenged Mr. Burnett’s resourcefulness. A man ahead of his time, he believed in supplying what his customers needed, if he could. He busied himself in his laboratory. He [went to New York] and bought a pound of the very best vanilla beans he could procure [for $3.50] and extracted the rare, delicate flavor of which she spoke, and after long, careful experiments, when he was satisfied with its quality, he made the first Vanilla Extract. “The lady was so pleased she urged him to make more, promising to take her supplies of it from him and to introduce it to her aristocratic friends. This was the beginning of Vanilla and other extracts in this country and throughout the world.
Joseph Burnett soon saw that if one flavor made business good, additional flavors would make business even better. In 1858 he became a partner with William G. Edmonds and the company became known as Joseph Burnett & Co. Soon his products were sold not only in the United States but all over the world as well. This policy of continuing to introduce new products distinguished the company throughout its history. By this time, the Company produced Lemon, Vanilla, Almond, Rose, Nutmeg, Peach, Celery, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nectarine, Ginger and Orange extracts. They also produced and sold, Wood Violet Perfume, Cologne, Cocoaine for the hair (which he invented in 1857 and sold for over 40 years), Florimel (a perfume for the handkerchief), Kalliston (for a healthy skin and complexion), Jamaica Ginger (for the stomach), Oriental Tooth Wash, Cod Liver Oil, Jonas Whitcomb’s Asthma Remedy and several other personal/medical products. By the early 20th Century, with the stricter drug laws and regulations, some of these products were no longer produced by the company, so only food related products and some toiletry products would be marketed. By the 1930’s the Joseph Burnett Co. was engaged solely in the preparation of flavoring extracts, color pastes & liquids, spices, and mixes. In 1894, just before Joseph Burnett died, a new factory was opened at 36 India Street. About this time the increasing interest in fancy cooking warranted the marketing of a pure color for coloring candies, frostings, etc. After extended experimenting in the laboratory and kitchen, Burnett’s Color Pastes were on the market.
The Joseph Burnett Company was incorporated in 1895. Joseph’s sons, Harry (treasurer) and Robert (interim president), and John T., who later (1907) became president of the company, continued the manufacturing policy of their father, which was to make the very finest extracts that could be made and advertise the fact to the consumer. The wisdom of this policy can be discerned in the steady growth of the sales, which by the 1920’s necessitated the building of a fine new factory, equipped with all the latest machinery for manufacturing, packaging and handling the various products. In 1919, after a careful market analysis, it was decided that fine spices could be handled to advantage, and so Burnett’s Spices, the choicest grown in the tropics, were added to the extract line.
During the 1920’s thru the 1940’s, the Burnett Company added Mint Jelly, Marshmallow, Flavored Puddings, a Liquid-Mix for making Ice Cream and Sherbet, a Ready-Mix Powder for making ice cream, and a Pie Crust and Muffin Mix. Many different flavors and colors were added to the extract, food coloring, and paste products. At this time Burnett’s boasted 29 extract flavors. The Joseph Burnett Company, a division of American [Home] Foods, Inc., and known for more than a century for its flavoring extracts and food colorings, introduced instant puddings of chocolate, butterscotch, and, of course, vanilla in 1951.
In 1946 the company was sold to American Home Foods, Inc., a subsidiary of American Home Products Corporation, now known as Wyeth. The last ownership of the Burnett products was the Doxsee Food Corporation which stopped producing them at an unknown date. Doxsee Food Corporation, which merged with Snow’s Seafood Corporation, is currently part of Castleberry’s Food Company. Castleberry’s acquired the Snow’s / Doxsee business in 1994.”

Great article but one small correction – Joseph and Josephine Burnett had 12 children not just 4 as mentioned.  As an aside, the Burnett family still holds a family reunion every 2 years in the town of Southborough, MA where Joseph and Josephine lived.

* Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran


Joseph Burnett (26 December 1899 – 19 November 1941) was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) officer most widely known as the captain of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney in the battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran on 19 November 1941. He fought in both World War I and World War II, serving in the RAN and the Royal Navy (RN),[1] and went down with the Sydney off the coast of Western Australia.
The loss of the Sydney was significant for two main reasons. First, it represented the loss of one third of all RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II in a single engagement—and not far from Australian soil, at that. Second, great mystery surrounded its loss. There had been no Australian survivors, and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less well-armed merchant raider. As commander of the Sydney, Burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew, so he was an obvious target for criticism. Investigations into the ship's sinking have tried to examine his apparent decisions in the period leading up to the battle.
Regardless of the events of that day, Burnett was viewed as a good man and competent commander by his peers. His sons both pursued naval careers and served in the RAN. Following a successful search for the Sydney and Kormoran that located both wrecks in 2008, controversy surrounding Burnett's command arose again. His younger son, retired Commodore Rory Burnett, has defended him through various public statements.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 26 December 1899 in Singleton, New South Wales, Australia.[1][2] He was the second son of Richard Burnett and Emily Burnett (née Adams), and the grandson of William Burnett, a blacksmith from Cornwall who had emigrated to New South Wales in 1859.[3] He attended Singleton Primary School, where he demonstrated both academic and sporting ability.[1][3]
Burnett's father died when he was just seven years old, and it is possible that the boy was attracted to the newly formed Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) by the possibility of a free education, as well as adventure.[3] On 31 December 1912, he entered the RANC in Geelong, becoming one of its first entrants as a Cadet Midshipman.[1][2][3] He graduated as a Midshipman from the RANC on 1 January 1917.[2]
World War I[edit]




Burnett's first assignment was aboard the battlecruiser HMAS Australia


Burnett was sent to England, where he served aboard HMAS Australia,[1][2][3] the flagship of 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. He remained with the ship for the remainder of World War I, seeing service in the Atlantic Ocean,[3] and reached the rank of Sub-Lieutenant in October 1918.[1][2] At the conclusion of the war, HMAS Australia sailed for Australia, departing on 24 April 1919 and arriving on 28 May.
Inter-war years[edit]




Burnett's second posting at sea was aboard the battleship HMS Royal Oak


Burnett left HMAS Australia before departure and remained in England on an attachment to the RN, with which he served for the next seven years.[3] During this time, he played on the RN's rugby team, and was also known for his performance in athletics, cricket, and tennis.[3] In January 1920, Burnett was promoted to Lieutenant.[2] By 1922, he had qualified as a Gunnery Officer.[1] He served aboard HMS Royal Oak during those years.[2]
In 1924, Burnett was appointed as the gunnery officer on board HMAS Adelaide,[2] before marrying Enid Ward and returning briefly to Australia, although still attached to the RN. After three years in Australia, he returned to England and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 January 1928.[2] That year, he joined HMAS Canberra, which he stayed with until 1932 when he attended Naval Staff College at Greenwich.[2] He was promoted to Commander in December 1932,[1][2] and remained at the college until 1933. Burnett once more returned to Australia, where he worked for the Navy Office in Melbourne for two years.
The Burnetts had two sons and a daughter: Patrick (born 1928), Rory (born 1929), and Bridget (born 1936).[4][5]
Burnett missed the sea, and in 1936, he was reunited with HMAS Canberra,[2] this time as executive officer. In 1937, he returned to England for the last time, serving aboard HMS Royal Oak and HMS Resolution.[2] Whilst in England, he completed the Imperial Defence College course,[1] and was promoted to Captain on 31 December 1938.[2]
World War II[edit]
At the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, Burnett was recalled to Australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the Navy Office in Melbourne.[1] By October 1940, he had been sent to Singapore as the senior RAN representative at an Allied conference considering the defence of the Asia-Pacific region.[1][2] At the conference, he called for the establishment of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, which proved successful at patrolling harbour entrances throughout the war.
On 14 May 1941, Burnett received his first direct command when he was posted to HMAS Sydney.[1][2] The ship had already acquired a distinguished war record in the Battle of the Mediterranean. Sydney had just completed a refit and her primary duties at the time were escorting convoys. The previous commanding officer was then Captain John Collins.[6]
Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran[edit]
Main article: Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran




The light cruiser HMAS Sydney was Burnett's command from May 1941


In November 1941, HMAS Sydney undertook a mission to escort the troopship Zealandia to the Sunda Strait. The Sydney was returning to Fremantle when, at about 4:00 PM on 19 November at a point off the coast between Carnarvon and Geraldton, the crew sighted what appeared to be a merchant ship approximately 20 kilometres (11 nmi) away and challenged it. The other ship was the Kormoran, a merchant raider disguised as the Dutch freighter Straat Malakka.
According to accounts by Kormoran crew members, Sydney chased and overhauled the raider, while exchanging signals and attempting to verify her identity. The Sydney closed to within 1,000 yards and demanded a password from the Kormoran, at which point the raider opened fire on the Sydney. Survivors' accounts seemed to indicate that the Sydney was not ready for the engagement, and the Australian cruiser was hit several times before returning fire. At this point, the Sydney had caught fire.
The Sydney was better armoured and more heavily armed than the Kormoran, and struck her severely on the funnel and engine room, which caught fire immediately. With both ships critically damaged, the Sydney turned southwards. She disappeared from the view of the Kormoran and sank with all hands on board.[1] The Kormoran was too badly damaged to be saved, and was scuttled by her captain.
Controversy[edit]
The loss of the Sydney was a significant event in Australia—of all the RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II, one third of them went down with the Sydney.[7] Many[who?] found it difficult to believe that a converted merchant ship could sink a modern light cruiser, and also found it difficult to believe that a senior officer such as Burnett took his ship within 1,000 metres (1,100 yards) of an unidentified and possibly dangerous vessel during wartime without preparing for action, and with such disastrous results. It was also seen as strange[by whom?] that the bulk of the crew of the Kormoran survived, while there were no known survivors from the Sydney.
In 2008, following the discovery of the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran, controversy about Burnett's alleged actions arose again.[5][8] In particular, one German survivor of the battle had reportedly accused Burnett of 'incompetent' and 'criminal' action—a claim refuted by Rory Burnett, who said: "I don't think he's in any position to make that judgment, but he's entitled to his opinion. My father was a very professional and highly regarded officer."[5] He also said: "I'm not saying that closing was right. Indeed, with hindsight, it proved to be wrong. But closing on suspected ships had become a well-accepted tactic. It was not doctrine but it had been used successfully before by other experienced officers."[9]
In August 2009, The Australian reported that the official inquiry led by Terence Cole "found [Burnett] behaved inexplicably, but not negligently, when he brought the warship too close to a German raider."[10]
Legacy[edit]
Collins, by then a Vice Admiral, wrote to Burnett's elder son, Patrick, saying: "Joe Burnett was one of our finest officers. An outstanding sport with a good brain—an unusual combination. With these qualifications and, as you so well know, a happy and cheerful disposition it is not surprising that he was one of the most popular of our year."[11]
Burnett's sons, who were aged 13 and 12 when he died, both attended the RANC and went on to careers in the RAN.[11] Younger son Rory received a special cadetship.[12] Patrick reached the rank of Commander and Rory reached the rank of Commodore.[3][5][8][9]
Burnett is commemorated by the Burnett Memorial Prize for rugby at the RANC.[11]

* Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran


Joseph Burnett (26 December 1899 – 19 November 1941) was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) officer most widely known as the captain of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney in the battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran on 19 November 1941. He fought in both World War I and World War II, serving in the RAN and the Royal Navy (RN),[1] and went down with the Sydney off the coast of Western Australia.
The loss of the Sydney was significant for two main reasons. First, it represented the loss of one third of all RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II in a single engagement—and not far from Australian soil, at that. Second, great mystery surrounded its loss. There had been no Australian survivors, and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less well-armed merchant raider. As commander of the Sydney, Burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew, so he was an obvious target for criticism. Investigations into the ship's sinking have tried to examine his apparent decisions in the period leading up to the battle.
Regardless of the events of that day, Burnett was viewed as a good man and competent commander by his peers. His sons both pursued naval careers and served in the RAN. Following a successful search for the Sydney and Kormoran that located both wrecks in 2008, controversy surrounding Burnett's command arose again. His younger son, retired Commodore Rory Burnett, has defended him through various public statements.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 26 December 1899 in Singleton, New South Wales, Australia.[1][2] He was the second son of Richard Burnett and Emily Burnett (née Adams), and the grandson of William Burnett, a blacksmith from Cornwall who had emigrated to New South Wales in 1859.[3] He attended Singleton Primary School, where he demonstrated both academic and sporting ability.[1][3]
Burnett's father died when he was just seven years old, and it is possible that the boy was attracted to the newly formed Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) by the possibility of a free education, as well as adventure.[3] On 31 December 1912, he entered the RANC in Geelong, becoming one of its first entrants as a Cadet Midshipman.[1][2][3] He graduated as a Midshipman from the RANC on 1 January 1917.[2]
World War I[edit]




Burnett's first assignment was aboard the battlecruiser HMAS Australia


Burnett was sent to England, where he served aboard HMAS Australia,[1][2][3] the flagship of 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. He remained with the ship for the remainder of World War I, seeing service in the Atlantic Ocean,[3] and reached the rank of Sub-Lieutenant in October 1918.[1][2] At the conclusion of the war, HMAS Australia sailed for Australia, departing on 24 April 1919 and arriving on 28 May.
Inter-war years[edit]




Burnett's second posting at sea was aboard the battleship HMS Royal Oak


Burnett left HMAS Australia before departure and remained in England on an attachment to the RN, with which he served for the next seven years.[3] During this time, he played on the RN's rugby team, and was also known for his performance in athletics, cricket, and tennis.[3] In January 1920, Burnett was promoted to Lieutenant.[2] By 1922, he had qualified as a Gunnery Officer.[1] He served aboard HMS Royal Oak during those years.[2]
In 1924, Burnett was appointed as the gunnery officer on board HMAS Adelaide,[2] before marrying Enid Ward and returning briefly to Australia, although still attached to the RN. After three years in Australia, he returned to England and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 January 1928.[2] That year, he joined HMAS Canberra, which he stayed with until 1932 when he attended Naval Staff College at Greenwich.[2] He was promoted to Commander in December 1932,[1][2] and remained at the college until 1933. Burnett once more returned to Australia, where he worked for the Navy Office in Melbourne for two years.
The Burnetts had two sons and a daughter: Patrick (born 1928), Rory (born 1929), and Bridget (born 1936).[4][5]
Burnett missed the sea, and in 1936, he was reunited with HMAS Canberra,[2] this time as executive officer. In 1937, he returned to England for the last time, serving aboard HMS Royal Oak and HMS Resolution.[2] Whilst in England, he completed the Imperial Defence College course,[1] and was promoted to Captain on 31 December 1938.[2]
World War II[edit]
At the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, Burnett was recalled to Australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the Navy Office in Melbourne.[1] By October 1940, he had been sent to Singapore as the senior RAN representative at an Allied conference considering the defence of the Asia-Pacific region.[1][2] At the conference, he called for the establishment of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, which proved successful at patrolling harbour entrances throughout the war.

Burnett's sons, who were aged 13 and 12 when he died, both attended the RANC and went on to careers in the RAN.[11] Younger son Rory received a special cadetship.[12] Patrick reached the rank of Commander and Rory reached the rank of Commodore.[3][5][8][9]
Burnett is commemorated by the Burnett Memorial Prize for rugby at the RANC.[11]

* Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran


Joseph Burnett (26 December 1899 – 19 November 1941) was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) officer most widely known as the captain of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney in the battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran on 19 November 1941. He fought in both World War I and World War II, serving in the RAN and the Royal Navy (RN),[1] and went down with the Sydney off the coast of Western Australia.
The loss of the Sydney was significant for two main reasons. First, it represented the loss of one third of all RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II in a single engagement—and not far from Australian soil, at that. Second, great mystery surrounded its loss. There had been no Australian survivors, and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less well-armed merchant raider. As commander of the Sydney, Burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew, so he was an obvious target for criticism. Investigations into the ship's sinking have tried to examine his apparent decisions in the period leading up to the battle.
Regardless of the events of that day, Burnett was viewed as a good man and competent commander by his peers. His sons both pursued naval careers and served in the RAN. Following a successful search for the Sydney and Kormoran that located both wrecks in 2008, controversy surrounding Burnett's command arose again. His younger son, retired Commodore Rory Burnett, has defended him through various public statements.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 26 December 1899 in Singleton, New South Wales, Australia.[1][2] He was the second son of Richard Burnett and Emily Burnett (née Adams), and the grandson of William Burnett, a blacksmith from Cornwall who had emigrated to New South Wales in 1859.[3] He attended Singleton Primary School, where he demonstrated both academic and sporting ability.[1][3]
Burnett's father died when he was just seven years old, and it is possible that the boy was attracted to the newly formed Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) by the possibility of a free education, as well as adventure.[3] On 31 December 1912, he entered the RANC in Geelong, becoming one of its first entrants as a Cadet Midshipman.[1][2][3] He graduated as a Midshipman from the RANC on 1 January 1917.[2]
World War I[edit]




Burnett's first assignment was aboard the battlecruiser HMAS Australia


Burnett was sent to England, where he served aboard HMAS Australia,[1][2][3] the flagship of 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. He remained with the ship for the remainder of World War I, seeing service in the Atlantic Ocean,[3] and reached the rank of Sub-Lieutenant in October 1918.[1][2] At the conclusion of the war, HMAS Australia sailed for Australia, departing on 24 April 1919 and arriving on 28 May.
Inter-war years[edit]




Burnett's second posting at sea was aboard the battleship HMS Royal Oak


Burnett left HMAS Australia before departure and remained in England on an attachment to the RN, with which he served for the next seven years.[3] During this time, he played on the RN's rugby team, and was also known for his performance in athletics, cricket, and tennis.[3] In January 1920, Burnett was promoted to Lieutenant.[2] By 1922, he had qualified as a Gunnery Officer.[1] He served aboard HMS Royal Oak during those years.[2]
In 1924, Burnett was appointed as the gunnery officer on board HMAS Adelaide,[2] before marrying Enid Ward and returning briefly to Australia, although still attached to the RN. After three years in Australia, he returned to England and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 January 1928.[2] That year, he joined HMAS Canberra, which he stayed with until 1932 when he attended Naval Staff College at Greenwich.[2] He was promoted to Commander in December 1932,[1][2] and remained at the college until 1933. Burnett once more returned to Australia, where he worked for the Navy Office in Melbourne for two years.
The Burnetts had two sons and a daughter: Patrick (born 1928), Rory (born 1929), and Bridget (born 1936).[4][5]
Burnett missed the sea, and in 1936, he was reunited with HMAS Canberra,[2] this time as executive officer. In 1937, he returned to England for the last time, serving aboard HMS Royal Oak and HMS Resolution.[2] Whilst in England, he completed the Imperial Defence College course,[1] and was promoted to Captain on 31 December 1938.[2]
World War II[edit]
At the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, Burnett was recalled to Australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the Navy Office in Melbourne.[1] By October 1940, he had been sent to Singapore as the senior RAN representative at an Allied conference considering the defence of the Asia-Pacific region.[1][2] At the conference, he called for the establishment of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, which proved successful at patrolling harbour entrances throughout the war.
On 14 May 1941, Burnett received his first direct command when he was posted to HMAS Sydney.[1][2] The ship had already acquired a distinguished war record in the Battle of the Mediterranean. Sydney had just completed a refit and her primary duties at the time were escorting convoys. The previous commanding officer was then Captain John Collins.[6]
Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran[edit]
Main article: Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran




The light cruiser HMAS Sydney was Burnett's command from May 1941


In November 1941, HMAS Sydney undertook a mission to escort the troopship Zealandia to the Sunda Strait. The Sydney was returning to Fremantle when, at about 4:00 PM on 19 November at a point off the coast between Carnarvon and Geraldton, the crew sighted what appeared to be a merchant ship approximately 20 kilometres (11 nmi) away and challenged it. The other ship was the Kormoran, a merchant raider disguised as the Dutch freighter Straat Malakka.
According to accounts by Kormoran crew members, Sydney chased and overhauled the raider, while exchanging signals and attempting to verify her identity. The Sydney closed to within 1,000 yards and demanded a password from the Kormoran, at which point the raider opened fire on the Sydney. Survivors' accounts seemed to indicate that the Sydney was not ready for the engagement, and the Australian cruiser was hit several times before returning fire. At this point, the Sydney had caught fire.
The Sydney was better armoured and more heavily armed than the Kormoran, and struck her severely on the funnel and engine room, which caught fire immediately. With both ships critically damaged, the Sydney turned southwards. She disappeared from the view of the Kormoran and sank with all hands on board.[1] The Kormoran was too badly damaged to be saved, and was scuttled by her captain.
Controversy[edit]
The loss of the Sydney was a significant event in Australia—of all the RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II, one third of them went down with the Sydney.[7] Many[who?] found it difficult to believe that a converted merchant ship could sink a modern light cruiser, and also found it difficult to believe that a senior officer such as Burnett took his ship within 1,000 metres (1,100 yards) of an unidentified and possibly dangerous vessel during wartime without preparing for action, and with such disastrous results. It was also seen as strange[by whom?] that the bulk of the crew of the Kormoran survived, while there were no known survivors from the Sydney.
In 2008, following the discovery of the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran, controversy about Burnett's alleged actions arose again.[5][8] In particular, one German survivor of the battle had reportedly accused Burnett of 'incompetent' and 'criminal' action—a claim refuted by Rory Burnett, who said: "I don't think he's in any position to make that judgment, but he's entitled to his opinion. My father was a very professional and highly regarded officer."[5] He also said: "I'm not saying that closing was right. Indeed, with hindsight, it proved to be wrong. But closing on suspected ships had become a well-accepted tactic. It was not doctrine but it had been used successfully before by other experienced officers."[9]
In August 2009, The Australian reported that the official inquiry led by Terence Cole "found [Burnett] behaved inexplicably, but not negligently, when he brought the warship too close to a German raider."[10]
Legacy[edit]
Collins, by then a Vice Admiral, wrote to Burnett's elder son, Patrick, saying: "Joe Burnett was one of our finest officers. An outstanding sport with a good brain—an unusual combination. With these qualifications and, as you so well know, a happy and cheerful disposition it is not surprising that he was one of the most popular of our year."[11]
Burnett's sons, who were aged 13 and 12 when he died, both attended the RANC and went on to careers in the RAN.[11] Younger son Rory received a special cadetship.[12] Patrick reached the rank of Commander and Rory reached the rank of Commodore.[3][5][8][9]
Burnett is commemorated by the Burnett Memorial Prize for rugby at the RANC.[11]

* Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran


Joseph Burnett (26 December 1899 – 19 November 1941) was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) officer most widely known as the captain of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney in the battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran on 19 November 1941. He fought in both World War I and World War II, serving in the RAN and the Royal Navy (RN),[1] and went down with the Sydney off the coast of Western Australia.
The loss of the Sydney was significant for two main reasons. First, it represented the loss of one third of all RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II in a single engagement—and not far from Australian soil, at that. Second, great mystery surrounded its loss. There had been no Australian survivors, and so it was not clear how or why a warship had been in a position to be sunk by a less well-armed merchant raider. As commander of the Sydney, Burnett bore primary responsibility for the ship and its crew, so he was an obvious target for criticism. Investigations into the ship's sinking have tried to examine his apparent decisions in the period leading up to the battle.
Regardless of the events of that day, Burnett was viewed as a good man and competent commander by his peers. His sons both pursued naval careers and served in the RAN. Following a successful search for the Sydney and Kormoran that located both wrecks in 2008, controversy surrounding Burnett's command arose again. His younger son, retired Commodore Rory Burnett, has defended him through various public statements.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 26 December 1899 in Singleton, New South Wales, Australia.[1][2] He was the second son of Richard Burnett and Emily Burnett (née Adams), and the grandson of William Burnett, a blacksmith from Cornwall who had emigrated to New South Wales in 1859.[3] He attended Singleton Primary School, where he demonstrated both academic and sporting ability.[1][3]
Burnett's father died when he was just seven years old, and it is possible that the boy was attracted to the newly formed Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) by the possibility of a free education, as well as adventure.[3] On 31 December 1912, he entered the RANC in Geelong, becoming one of its first entrants as a Cadet Midshipman.[1][2][3] He graduated as a Midshipman from the RANC on 1 January 1917.[2]
World War I[edit]




Burnett's first assignment was aboard the battlecruiser HMAS Australia


Burnett was sent to England, where he served aboard HMAS Australia,[1][2][3] the flagship of 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. He remained with the ship for the remainder of World War I, seeing service in the Atlantic Ocean,[3] and reached the rank of Sub-Lieutenant in October 1918.[1][2] At the conclusion of the war, HMAS Australia sailed for Australia, departing on 24 April 1919 and arriving on 28 May.
Inter-war years[edit]




Burnett's second posting at sea was aboard the battleship HMS Royal Oak


Burnett left HMAS Australia before departure and remained in England on an attachment to the RN, with which he served for the next seven years.[3] During this time, he played on the RN's rugby team, and was also known for his performance in athletics, cricket, and tennis.[3] In January 1920, Burnett was promoted to Lieutenant.[2] By 1922, he had qualified as a Gunnery Officer.[1] He served aboard HMS Royal Oak during those years.[2]
In 1924, Burnett was appointed as the gunnery officer on board HMAS Adelaide,[2] before marrying Enid Ward and returning briefly to Australia, although still attached to the RN. After three years in Australia, he returned to England and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 January 1928.[2] That year, he joined HMAS Canberra, which he stayed with until 1932 when he attended Naval Staff College at Greenwich.[2] He was promoted to Commander in December 1932,[1][2] and remained at the college until 1933. Burnett once more returned to Australia, where he worked for the Navy Office in Melbourne for two years.
The Burnetts had two sons and a daughter: Patrick (born 1928), Rory (born 1929), and Bridget (born 1936).[4][5]
Burnett missed the sea, and in 1936, he was reunited with HMAS Canberra,[2] this time as executive officer. In 1937, he returned to England for the last time, serving aboard HMS Royal Oak and HMS Resolution.[2] Whilst in England, he completed the Imperial Defence College course,[1] and was promoted to Captain on 31 December 1938.[2]
World War II[edit]
At the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, Burnett was recalled to Australia where he was made assistant chief of naval staff at the Navy Office in Melbourne.[1] By October 1940, he had been sent to Singapore as the senior RAN representative at an Allied conference considering the defence of the Asia-Pacific region.[1][2] At the conference, he called for the establishment of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, which proved successful at patrolling harbour entrances throughout the war.
On 14 May 1941, Burnett received his first direct command when he was posted to HMAS Sydney.[1][2] The ship had already acquired a distinguished war record in the Battle of the Mediterranean. Sydney had just completed a refit and her primary duties at the time were escorting convoys. The previous commanding officer was then Captain John Collins.[6]
Battle between HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran[edit]
Main article: Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran




The light cruiser HMAS Sydney was Burnett's command from May 1941


In November 1941, HMAS Sydney undertook a mission to escort the troopship Zealandia to the Sunda Strait. The Sydney was returning to Fremantle when, at about 4:00 PM on 19 November at a point off the coast between Carnarvon and Geraldton, the crew sighted what appeared to be a merchant ship approximately 20 kilometres (11 nmi) away and challenged it. The other ship was the Kormoran, a merchant raider disguised as the Dutch freighter Straat Malakka.
According to accounts by Kormoran crew members, Sydney chased and overhauled the raider, while exchanging signals and attempting to verify her identity. The Sydney closed to within 1,000 yards and demanded a password from the Kormoran, at which point the raider opened fire on the Sydney. Survivors' accounts seemed to indicate that the Sydney was not ready for the engagement, and the Australian cruiser was hit several times before returning fire. At this point, the Sydney had caught fire.
The Sydney was better armoured and more heavily armed than the Kormoran, and struck her severely on the funnel and engine room, which caught fire immediately. With both ships critically damaged, the Sydney turned southwards. She disappeared from the view of the Kormoran and sank with all hands on board.[1] The Kormoran was too badly damaged to be saved, and was scuttled by her captain.
Controversy[edit]
The loss of the Sydney was a significant event in Australia—of all the RAN officers and sailors who died during World War II, one third of them went down with the Sydney.[7] Many[who?] found it difficult to believe that a converted merchant ship could sink a modern light cruiser, and also found it difficult to believe that a senior officer such as Burnett took his ship within 1,000 metres (1,100 yards) of an unidentified and possibly dangerous vessel during wartime without preparing for action, and with such disastrous results. It was also seen as strange[by whom?] that the bulk of the crew of the Kormoran survived, while there were no known survivors from the Sydney.
In 2008, following the discovery of the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran, controversy about Burnett's alleged actions arose again.[5][8] In particular, one German survivor of the battle had reportedly accused Burnett of 'incompetent' and 'criminal' action—a claim refuted by Rory Burnett, who said: "I don't think he's in any position to make that judgment, but he's entitled to his opinion. My father was a very professional and highly regarded officer."[5] He also said: "I'm not saying that closing was right. Indeed, with hindsight, it proved to be wrong. But closing on suspected ships had become a well-accepted tactic. It was not doctrine but it had been used successfully before by other experienced officers."[9]
In August 2009, The Australian reported that the official inquiry led by Terence Cole "found [Burnett] behaved inexplicably, but not negligently, when he brought the warship too close to a German raider."[10]
Legacy[edit]
Collins, by then a Vice Admiral, wrote to Burnett's elder son, Patrick, saying: "Joe Burnett was one of our finest officers. An outstanding sport with a good brain—an unusual combination. With these qualifications and, as you so well know, a happy and cheerful disposition it is not surprising that he was one of the most popular of our year."[11]
Burnett's sons, who were aged 13 and 12 when he died, both attended the RANC and went on to careers in the RAN.[11] Younger son Rory received a special cadetship.[12] Patrick reached the rank of Commander and Rory reached the rank of Commodore.[3][5][8][9]
Burnett is commemorated by the Burnett Memorial Prize for rugby at the RANC.[11]

Artifact Description

Present among the beauty products excavated from the SS Republic wreck site are a host of hair potions including 44 bottles bearing the embossed name "Burnett's Cocoaine." The invention of Massachusetts' Joseph Burnett, the formula may have been intended to exploit the public's fixation with the many cocaine-laced patent medicines flooding the market. Unlike most of his competitors, having graduated from the Worcester College of Pharmacy, Burnett stands out as one of the few fully qualified proprietors certified as a pharmacist. The original product, made from "scientifically selected ingredients" including coconut oil and 50 percent alcohol, was touted the ideal compound to stimulate healthy and vigorous hair growth. Labeled "A Perfect Hair Dressing," Burnett's maker promised his hair treatment would restore lost hair and prevent it from falling out. At just 50 cents a bottle in 1859, it was also promoted as the "best and cheapest hair dressing in the world." Burnett launched his career working for Theodore Metcalf, a Boston dealer of drugs and toilet articles. In 1847, the young pharmacist opened his own apothecary in Boston. Ten years later, Burnett partnered with William G. Edmunds, and the business became Joseph Burnett & Co. The firm boasted a number of other products including Jonas Whitcomb's Asthma Remedy, a cologne water, assorted flavoring extracts and a freckle remover, but it's most lucrative preparation remained Burnett's Cocoaine.

In this landmark doctrinal discourse given by Elder Joseph E. Taylor in 1890, the differing duties of the various offices of the Priesthood are layed out in a clear and precise manner.  Discussed is not only the office of Apostle, of which the Quorum of the Twelve and the Quorum of the Seventy are a part of, but also the offices of Patriarch, Bishop, Elder, High Priest, and the Aaronic Priesthood offices.

There is quoted an article from 1873 which reports that President Brigham Young organized a Quorum of Seven which stood higher in rank than did the Quorum of the Twelve.  Additionally, there are quotes on the Apostleship, on the Apostleship of the Seventy (something which is not generally understood today), the relationship of the Seventy and High Priest, and the fulness of the Priesthood.

Another fine product from The FIG Project. Dedicated to disseminating interesting & hard-to-find discourses, writings, reproductions, and original rare items from the early days of the LDS... More > (Mormon) Church.< Less

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
