September 15th Options Now Available For Brookdale Senior Living (BKD)

Investors in Brookdale Senior Living Inc (Symbol: BKD) saw new options become available today, for the September 15th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the BKD options chain for the new September 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $14.00 strike price has a current bid of 85 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $14.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $13.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of BKD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $14.32/share today. 

Because the $14.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.07% return on the cash commitment, or 41.81% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Brookdale Senior Living Inc, and highlighting in green where the $14.00 strike is located relative to that history: 



Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of 70 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of BKD stock at the current price level of $14.32/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $15.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.64% if the stock gets called away at the September 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if BKD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Brookdale Senior Living Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing BKD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.00 strike highlighted in red: 

Considering the fact that the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.89% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.66% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 54%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 52%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $14.32) to be 41%.

3 Reasons Welltower Inc. Stock Could Fall
REITs have lagged the market over the past year or so, but these things could cause Welltower to drop again.











                Matthew Frankel
            

                (TMFMathGuy)



            
            Jul 20, 2017 at 8:03AM
            
            





Healthcare real estate investment trust Welltower (NYSE:HCN), like most REITs, has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year or so, down about 4% despite a 14% rise in the index. And while I'm a big believer in healthcare real estate as a long-term investment, there's certainly more downside risk, at least in the near term. Here are three specific factors that could cause Welltower to fall.
Interest rates could rise faster than expected
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since late 2015, by 25 basis points each time. As it sits now, the target federal funds rate is 1.00%-1.25%. However, that's still quite low by historical standards.

Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts
The Fed sees the federal funds rate at 2.1% by the end of 2018, and close to 3% by the end of 2019. However, it's important to point out that this would still be quite low historically, as you can see in the chart. In fact, from the mid-1960s to the early 2000s, the federal funds rate barely dipped below 3% at all.
My point is that since the Fed's projections are closely followed, they are somewhat accounted for in Welltower's current stock price. However, if the economy heats up more than expected, the Fed could speed up their rate increases, which would probably put downward pressure on REITs.

Oversupply issues could plague senior housing
Whenever you have a rapidly growing market, oversupply can become a concern. Companies see opportunity and build new properties, and they sometimes build too much to accommodate the demand. To name a current example, oversupply fears are a big reason self-storage REITs have underperformed the market recently.
According to a presentation by fellow healthcare REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust, until about 2015, the market was absorbing senior housing faster than inventory was growing. Recently, however, the opposite has been the case. Absorption rates are still very high, but new inventory is being built even faster. As a result, industry occupancy has slightly fallen from just over 90% to about 89% since late 2014. In a nutshell, oversupply hasn't become too much of a problem yet, but this is certainly a trend worth monitoring.

One of Welltower's major partners could face tough times
Welltower partners with some of the best-respected operators in the senior housing business, with Sunrise Senior Living and Brookdale Senior Living operating many properties. A less-optimistic way of saying the same thing is that large portions of Welltower's rental income is dependent on just a few companies.
As of the first quarter, 40% of Welltower's in-place net operating income came from its top five partners, which are:

Sunrise Senior Living (15.5%).
Brookdale Senior Living (7.6%).
Genesis Healthcare (7%).
Revera (5.7%).
Benchmark Senior Living (4.4%).

To be clear, I wouldn't call any of these a "dangerously high" concentration. Many other healthcare REITs are far more dependent on certain operators. For reference, fellow senior-housing-oriented healthcare REIT HCP relies on its top three tenants for 44% of its net operating income, as opposed to around 30% for Welltower.
Having said that, if one of Welltower's major tenant/partners ran into financial difficulty, it could certainly be a negative catalyst for the stock.
The Foolish bottom line
This isn't an exhaustive list of reasons Welltower could fall, but they are three things that could certainly happen. Even if they do, however, none of these should create a long-term problem for the company. To sum it up, Welltower is a long-term winner. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see a few bumps like these along the road.

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 17, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  Dean Foods Company  (NYSE:  DF  - Free Report  ), Barnes & Noble, Inc.  (NYSE:  BKS  - Free Report  ), Brookdale Senior Living Inc.  (NYSE:  BKD  - Free Report  ), Dillard's Inc.  (NYSE:  DDS  - Free Report  ) and Plains GP Holdings, L.P.  (NYSE:  PAGP  - Free Report  ).  Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research:    5 Broker-Favorite Stocks Your Portfolio Must Have   As the second-quarter reporting cycle gets underway, investors would look to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation. Investors, after all, are driven by the sole objective of generating handsome returns from their portfolio. None of them want their hard-earned money to go down the drain. However, the task of including potential outperformers in one's portfolio is not an easy one. In fact, equity market tricks are not easy to master with a deluge of stocks flooding the space at any point of time. The task becomes even more daunting when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance. Given time constraints, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by experts in the field.  Seek Broker Advice  The concerned experts are brokers. Generally, three types of brokers (sell-side, buy-side and independent) are present in the investment world, with sell-side analysts being most common. They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion to investors on the stocks under their coverage after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors. Brokers, irrespective of their types, do intense research on stocks in their coverage before coming up with recommendations. Brokers/analysts attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action (buy, sell or hold a stock).  Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions  Brokers arrive at their recommendation on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty. Therefore, it is natural for investors, on seeing brokers improve their recommendation on a particular stock, to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind it. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons - favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario. To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.  Revenue Performance is Important  While we have talked about the bottom line in detail, the top line (revenue portion) cannot be ignored. Actually, according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). To address top-line concerns, we have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.  Screening Criteria   # (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75  : This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.  % change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10  : This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter. To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:  Price-to-Sales = Bot%10  : The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.  Price greater than 5  : A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.  Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days  : Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.  Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000  : This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.  Com/ADR/Canadian= Com  : This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks. Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:  Dean Foods Company  (NYSE:  DF  - Free Report  ), based in Dallas, TX, is a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the U.S. as well as a leading manufacturer of various specialty food products. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a healthy 11% expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years.  Barnes & Noble, Inc.  (NYSE:  BKS  - Free Report  ), is a leading U.S. retail bookseller as well as a prominent retailer of content and educational products. Earnings per share for the current year are projected to increase 30.23% on a year-over-year basis. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE:  BKD  - Free Report  ) is a leading owner and operator of senior living facilities throughout the United States. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an expected EPS growth rate of 13% for the next 3-5 years.  Dillard's Inc.  (NYSE:  DDS  - Free Report  ) is a large departmental store chain featuring fashion apparel and home furnishings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has increased 1 cent to 10 cents per share over the last month. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.  Plains GP Holdings, L.P.  (NYSE:  PAGP  - Free Report  ) ,  through its subsidiaries, is involved primarily in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude oil and refined products.

'Only the good die young,' says Danvers' oldest living resident







Monday
Jul 24, 2017 at 4:36 PM
Jul 24, 2017 at 4:39 PM




On July 21, "Josie" Spates celebrated her 108th birthday surrounded by family, friends and the residents of Brookdale Senior Living.

				Mary Byrne  
			
As Josephine Spates exited the elevator Friday afternoon, she asked a single question of the man walking beside her."What did I tell you this morning?" she said, laughing as she made her way to Brookdale Senior Living's birthday party for her. "Only the good die young."That one phrase, borrowed from Billy Joel, is the 108-year-old's best explanation for living a life as long as she has."I guess He had some purpose for keeping me here, but I don't know why," she said. "I've been very fortunate."On July 21 — surrounded by family and friends — Spates celebrated her 108th birthday, making her Danvers' oldest resident, according to the Town Clerk's office. The recent addition to Brookdale's community was born July 21, 1909, the 13th of 16 children born to Miles and Besse Hunter. Originally from Canada, she grew up along the Miramichi River.In 1926, at age 17, she moved to Danvers and has lived here ever since.Spates graduated as registered nurse from the Wentworth Hospital Training School for Nurses in Dover, N.H.After nursing, Spates worked at the corner store on Hobart and Locust Street, where her family lived upstairs."I liked the store better than I did nursing," she said.Some of her longest friends were made while she worked at the store — at least one of whom was at Friday's celebrations.During World War II, Spates worked in Topsfield at a chalk factory, which made chalk for marking landing strips for planes, and Bundles for Britain, which made knitted supplies that were sent to Britain."I tried to [do a lot for the cause], but it probably wasn't enough," she said.Spates also happens to be Danvers' oldest living Republican — which may have been what earned her an invitation to President Trump's 2017 inauguration, though she was unable to attend.While Spates attributes her longevity to the well-known words of Billy Joel, her son, Lewis Spates, 68, said his mother, who grew up on a farm, ate well.She also had a strong faith, he said, "and that sure helped."Lewis continued, quoting a passage from the Bible: "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord, your God, is giving you."Other family members described her as "a straight arrow," a healthy eater who never smoked or drank.Bruce Gutchell, her second cousin and a Danvers resident, said celebrating her 108th birthday was "amazing.""She's so alert, and her mind is so good," he said. "She can remember things from when she was a youngster like it was yesterday."And indeed, she recalled stories on Friday from her childhood, including Christmases with her siblings, thunderstorms on the river and repairing her glasses on days the eyeglass shop wasn't open.Still, when asked her favorite memory of the last 108 years, she had a hard time narrowing it down."It was all pretty good," she said. "I can't complain. I liked all of it."

Delivering the Best in Senior Care
It can be frustrating to find out that a senior living company doesn’t offer the care option your loved one needs. That’s why Brookdale offers not one but six different high-quality care options. By offering a variety of services, it ensures that we can properly care for your loved one both now and if their needs change in the future. You won’t have to start the entire process over again searching for a trustworthy care provider.

It may be confusing trying to figure out which care type is the right fit for your family. But this is not a task you need to figure out on your own. Our associates are ready to assist and are only a phone call away. Each one of our communities also performs a service assessment before a resident moves in, to determine the necessary care level. But you can familiarize yourself more with each care service through the pages below.
Independent Living Communities
Enjoy carefree living and leave the responsibility of home maintenance behind. Perfect for those who don’t need a lot of day-to-day assistance, this care level allows seniors to trade-in household chores, like cooking and cleaning, and live in a social and active community environment. Read more >
Assisted Living Communities
The right choice for those who need assistance with daily living. Assisted living provides more daily assistance to seniors, like help with taking medication, getting dressed in the morning, bathing, and so on. We offer a range of care services that can enhance quality of life and improve a senior’s health and safety. Read more >

Memory Care Communities
This specialized form of care provides the necessary resources and staff to care for seniors with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Our memory care program, the Clare Bridge Alzheimer's and Dementia Program, is deeply rooted in a person-centered approach. Read more >

Skilled Nursing Facilities

Medical Expertise Meets At-Home Care
Our home health care starts with a listening ear. We focus on listening to your needs and partnering with you to provide the best care and treatment solutions. We partner with you and your physician to ensure your care plan meets your needs. 
Brookdale Home Health provides customized home health services to older adults in need of doctor-ordered care due to an injury or illness. Our warm, caring approach to home health is delivered by a team of highly-skilled nurses, therapists, social workers, and aides. 

Home Health
For seniors at home or residing in a senior living community, medical and non-medical home care are options that provide a wide array of features and services. Brookdale Home Health >
 
Hospice
The Brookdale Hospice philosophy is that life is much more than physical health; it also includes the health of the human spirit. When physical health begins to fail, the nurturing of the spirit becomes critical for maintaining the dignity of the individual. Brookdale Hospice >














Learn More About Brookdale 
Along with home health and hospice, Brookdale offers several high-quality care options. By offering a variety of services, it ensures that we can properly care for your loved one both now and if their needs change in the future.

Brookdale Senior Living Inc. is the largest owner and operator of senior living communities in the United States with more than 550 facilities in 33 states. Brookdale's nearly 45,000 employees provide a wide variety of care services for more than 51,000 residents ranging from independent and assisted living to skilled nursing services.

Brookdale Senior Living is the largest owner and operator of senior living communities in the United States. Its IT department is largely centralized and operates out of its headquarters in Milwaukee, WI. 

Brookdale Senior Living has selected Aeroview to provide an EMR solution and a comprehensive WLAN network at all its location. The network will be available to all employees, and residents. There are many security, and compliance concerns with this implementation. The target completion date for this deployment is September 2013. 

Brookdale Senior Living is an Oracle shop. Its Enterprise Resource, Human Resources, and Business Intelligence platforms all operate around Oracle. Due to the lack of information technology products suited for a senior health care company the scope of Brookdale Senior Living, the company has specific teams that are tasked to design custom in house applications used across the Brookdale enterprise. The IT department is also composed of teams responsible for maintaining the company's infrastructure as well as its information security technology. Directors oversee PeopleSoft HCM, End User cervices, and various other technology aspects at Brookdale.

As of Q3 2012, Brookdale Senior Living Inc. is expecting IT storage spending to and decrease spending in archiving software, and file system software.

Brookdale Senior Living Inc. uses disk backup across NAS and SAN environment to back up its hybrid of block and file data. It uses legato as its main backup application. Its daily and weekly total data backup is 4TB and 15TB respectively, with a >8 hours backup window. Its backup growth is around 3. Relating to its remote locations, data is backed up locally, and all remote locations have WAN optimization deployed. 

The IT budget is typically finalized in Q1.

IT Intelligence Snippets
2013:
•25-100 tb data volume company-wide across 2 to 5 data centers, and expects an annual data growth of 6-10%. 
•75-90% of its servers are to be virtualized by the end of 2013. 
•Corporate IT manages 5000 mobile devices.
•Corporate IT manages 9000 desktops.

•Data center strategy is centered on standardizing on rack-mount x86 systems and virtualized servers. 
•Long term plan for running new applications is to add servers and virtualize, but no new facilities are scheduled.
•Less than 30% of IT staff is dedicated to the sustenance of its ERP platform.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. has received 3.34 out of 5 stars based on 12 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A-.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
