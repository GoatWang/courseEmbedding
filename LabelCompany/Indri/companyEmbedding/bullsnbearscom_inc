(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2014 and 2013 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Item 1A. Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in this Form 10-K. We use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.  OVERVIEW  Prior to the Asset Purchase Agreement with RP Capital Group, Ltd. and the development of our current products LUNA and VOLUPTAS in the third quarter of 2016 the acquisition in October 2012 of the URL domain names and websites of bullsnbears.com, we were a "shell company" as that term is defined in Federal securities laws. We are now a Company focused on developing intellectual property, contracting out the manufacturing of the products covered by the intellectual property and bringing to market these products through direct to consumer sales utilizing digital media, infomercials as well as distribution through third party vendor and retail outlets. Our first product LUNA is an alchemy of essential oils and peptide. The Company has begun to generate limited sales of LUNA at $20 per unit selling approximately 70 10 milliliter bottles. Currently the main product the Company is working toward manufacturing and developing a market for is VOLUPTAS, a female sexual arousal enhancer. A provisional patent for VOLUPTAS has been filed and the Company is currently engaged with a manufacturer in Texas to create 3D molds and will take the product through all of the necessary stability tests required over the next approximately 6 months in preparation to bring this product to market. Final pricing for the VOLUPTAS has not been decided upon. The Company is also looking to partner with third party companies to collaborate with them on marking and distributing private label products under the MJTV brand.  Following the closing of the acquisition of these assets, during the balance of the fourth quarter we commenced the design and development of our system. In order to provide the funds necessary to fully implement our business model and properly capitalize our company through the first stages of our business development plan and satisfy our obligations as they become due, we will need to raise approximately $2,500,000. We expect to use those funds to provide funds for general operating capital, including funds necessary to hire and compensate executive and other employees, as well as for 3D molds and product testing for VOLUPTAS, including staffing, support and equipment, advertising and marketing, expansion of business operations, and general working capital.  Although we have received approximately $310,000 977,200 in net proceeds from the sale of our one-year unsecured 10% convertible promissory notes in 2013 and $210,000 in 2014, we do not have any firm commitments to provide the balance of this capital and there are no assurances we will be successful in raising the necessary capital. Holders of $639,270 principal amount of these notes have delivered conversion notices to us. Approximately $664,200 principal amount of these notes matured between January 2014 and March 31, 2014 and have been issued their common shares and the balance of these notes mature between April 2014 and December 2014.  Between January 2013 and December 2013, we issued and sold 10% convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of $977,200 in a private offering. These notes mature one year from the date of issuance, and on the maturity date were convertible into Shares of Common Stock of the Company at a price of $1.00 per Share. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold an additional $210,000 principal amount of one-year notes, bearing an interest rate of 10% per annum and convertible at any time following issuance into Shares of Common Stock of the Company at a price of $1.00 per Share. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold an additional $5,000 principal amount of Series "A" 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, at a price of $1.25 per Share. These Shares bear annual cumulative dividends of 5%, payable at the option of the Company in cash or Shares of Common Stock. At the option of the holder, beginning one year from the date of issuance the Shares are convertible into Shares of Common Stock at a price of $1.25 per Share.  In February 2015, we converted $90,620 of these notes and accrued interest into 90,620 shares of Common Stock. The balance of the notes matured between January 2015 and March 2015 and are now presently due. However, As of December 28, 2016 we spun off BullsnBears Holdings Inc, including all assets and liabilities and other certain liabilities of the Parent company including all monies owed and no longer have these obligations on our books.  On September 30, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly-owned corporation, BullsnBears Holdings, Inc., for the purpose of holding the Company's intellectual property assets.  As of December 28, 2016 we spun off BullsnBears Holdings Inc, including all assets and liabilities and other certain liabilities of the Parent company including all monies owed Mr. Palladino, our former Chief Executive Officer, approximately $680,574 for funds he has advanced us for working capital. We therefore no longer have these obligations on our books.  GOING CONCERN  We have incurred net losses of $13,389,043 since inception through December 31, 2016. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our loss from operations and working capital deficit. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to generate revenues or report profitable operations or to continue as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2015  We generated $1,000 in revenues during 2016, compared to $22,610 in 2015. While we reasonably expect to report an increase in our revenues in 2017 as a result of the continued implementation of our business plan and the sale of our essential oil alchemy LUNA, our company is still in its early stages of operations. Given the significant amount of competition we face and our limited access to working capital which hinders our ability to market our products and services, there are no assurances we will be able to report any material increase in revenues during 2017.  During 2016, our operating expenses Increased by approximately 2,618% from 2015 due to increase in share based expense in 2016.  During 2016, our interest expense increased to $314,330 as compared to $66,174 in 2015, due to the increase in the issuance of the convertible notes  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash. At December 31, 2016 we had a cash balance of $26,767and a working capital deficit of ($947,339) as compared to cash on hand of $300 and a working capital deficit of $1,194,014. at December 31, 2016. We have relied solely on the issuance of convertible notes in 2016 in the amount of $345,000  We do not have any external sources of working capital and have been materially dependent upon the sale of convertible promissory notes to third parties as well as advances and loans from Mr. Farinella, our current Chief Executive Officer and current Chairman of the Board. Our working capital is not sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months and satisfy our obligations as they become due. As described earlier in this report, we need to raise significant capital to provide funds to implement our business model and pay our operating expenses. If we are not successful in raising the necessary capital, we will be unable to continue to expand our business and operations and satisfy our obligations as they become due. In that event, our ability to continue as a going concern will be in jeopardy and investors in our company could lose their entire investment.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company used ($337,415) of cash flow from operating activities compared with use of ($55,029) during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the use of cash flow from operating activities is mainly due to the change in business direction and development of new business model and plan  Cash Flows from Investing Activity  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's capital purchases were $0, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Same as above  During the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, the Company received $345,240 and $17,500, respectively, in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable. Additionally, the Company received cash advances and expenses paid on its behalf by a related party totaling $22,941and $45,127, respectively.  Critical Accounting Policies  Certain accounting policies which are critical to our financial statement presentation are described under Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements appearing later in this report.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term "off-balance sheet arrangement" generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

 

Various
statements in this report contain or may contain forward-looking
statements that are subject to known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from any
future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
were based on various factors and were derived from utilizing
numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include, but are not limited
to:

·

our recent
exit from shell status, lack of profitable operations and risk we
will ever generate revenues or profits,

·

need for
additional capital, including our ability to repay $619,500 in
notes to non-related parties, a substantial portion of which are
presently past due,

·

our
ability to continue as a going concern,

·

the
limited operating history of our business,

·

our
inability to manage our growth,

·

potential
infringement of first party intellectual property
rights,

·

our
ability to effectively compete,

·

our
ability to timely and effectively scale our technology,

·

the
limited trading market for our common stock which is quoted on the
OTC Markets,

·

anti-takeover
aspects of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
ability of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder
consent,

·

the
application of penny stock rules to trading in our common stock,
and

·

the
dilutive impact of outstanding convertible notes and
warrants.

 

You should
read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to
herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be
materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We
qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary
statements including those made in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors
appearing elsewhere in this report. Other sections of this report
include additional factors which could adversely impact our
business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from
time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict
all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Except for our ongoing
obligations to disclose material information under the Federal
securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to
report the occurrence of unanticipated events. These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this
report, and you should not rely on these statements without also
considering the risks and uncertainties associated with these
statements and our business.

MICHAEL
JAMES ENTERPRISES, INC.

(formerly
BullsnBears.com, Inc.) 
  Notes to
the Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial
Statements

 

1.

Nature of
Operations and Continuance of Business

 

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein have been prepared by Michael James Enterprises,
Inc. (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.) (the “ Company ”
) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ” ). We suggest that
these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the
audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.
We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position and the results of operations for the interim periods
presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made
are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the
financial statements which would substantially duplicate the
disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the
most recent fiscal year as reported in Form 10-K have been
omitted.

 

On
December 31, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly-owned
corporation, BullsnBears Holdings, Inc., for the purpose of holding
the Company ’ s intellectual property assets.

 

The
financial statements presented are those of Michael James
Enterprises, Inc. (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.) (the Company)
(formerly Spicy Gourmet Manufacturing, Inc.), a Delaware
corporation. The Company was incorporated on December 30, 2010,
under the laws of the State of Delaware. During November 2012, The
Company changed its name from Spicy Gourmet Manufacturing, Inc. to
BullsnBears.com, Inc. and changed its name to Michael James
Enterprises, Inc.

 

Going
Concern

 

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
During the period from inception through June 30, 2016, the Company
has generated minimal revenues and has an accumulated deficit of
$3,514,307. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is
dependent upon the continued financial support from its management,
its ability to generate profits from the Company ’ s future
operations, identify future investment opportunities and obtain the
necessary debt or equity financing. These factors raise substantial
doubt regarding the Company ’ s ability to continue as a
going concern. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect the consolidation of the
individual financial statements of Michael James Enterprises, Inc.
and BullsnBears Holdings, Inc. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Basic and
Diluted Loss Per Share

The
Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on
the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator)
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period including
convertible debt, stock options, and warrants, using the treasury
stock method, and convertible securities, using the if-converted
method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the
period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be
purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted
EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is
anti-dilutive. The Company had net losses as of June 30, 2016 and
2015, so the diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares in
the diluted EPS because their effect is anti-dilutive. As of June
30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 the Company had outstanding warrants to
purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company also had
outstanding convertible note that could be converted into 535,716
shares and 650,716 shares as of June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are
considered to be representative of their respective fair values
because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
The fair value of the derivative liabilities have been valued using
a Black Scholes valuation model.

Derivative
Liabilities

Certain
of the Company ’ s convertible notes payable described in
Note 3 contain conversion features that qualify for embedded
derivative classification. The Company accounts for the embedded
derivative features in its convertible debentures in accordance
FASB ASC 815-10- Derivatives and Hedging, which requires a
periodic valuation of their fair value and a corresponding
recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives. The
recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of
the convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such
issuance as a debt discount, at the date of issuance, and the
excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as
a “ Loss on Derivative Liability ” in other expense.
The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end
of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be
reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on
derivative financial instruments.

 

 

 

New
Accounting Pronouncements




8

  

 

In August
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( “ FASB
” ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( “ ASU ”
) 2014-15 “ Presentation of Financial Statements —
Going Concern, ” outlining management ’ s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about
an entity ’ s ability to continue as a going concern, along
with the required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the
annual period ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption
permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to our
financial statements as a result of this change.

 

In April
2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs ( “ ASU 2015-03 ” ). ASU 2015-03
changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial
statements, by requiring them to be presented in the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than
as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest
expense. There is no change to the current guidance on the
recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. For public
business entities, ASU 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does
not expect ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

 

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 “ Financial
Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, ” which
revises an entity ’ s accounting related to (1) the
classification and measurement of investments in equity securities
and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for
financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends
certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of
financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted under certain
circumstances. ” The Company is currently assessing the
impact of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements.

 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
Under Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, lessees will be required
to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease
liability, which is a lessee ’ s obligation to make lease
payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a
right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee
’ s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for
the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the
effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements
and related disclosures.

 

In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which includes multiple provisions intended to
simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based
payments, including treatment of excess tax benefits and
forfeitures, as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax
withholding requirements. The ASU will take effect for public
companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application
permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is
evaluating the future impact of this ASU on the consolidated
financial statements.

 

Other
relevant recently issued accounting updates are not expected to
have a material impact on the Company ’ s consolidated
financial statements.

BullsNBears.com Announces Name Change to Michael James Enterprises, Inc. and Change of Stock Ticker Symbol



BullsNBears.com Subsidiary Will File Registration Statement With SEC to Effect Spin-Off

WEST PALM BEACH, FL--(Marketwired - Dec 4, 2015) -  BullsNBears.com, Inc. (OTC PINK: BNBI) today announced that on December 1, 2015 its Board of Directors approved changing the company's name to "Michael James Enterprises Inc." and filing with FINRA for a new stock ticker symbol, both of which will be effective December 11, 2015.
Additionally, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, BullsNBears Holdings, Inc. will file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed spin-off of that subsidiary and its proprietary Financial Networking Portal into a standalone, publicly traded company through a previously announced shareholder dividend.
The changes are in preparation for the Company's planned acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc., which is a Direct Response Marketing Company and which will enhance its growth strategy leveraging its Public company status for future capital raises, marketing, branding and advertising while gaining investor visibility. 
James M. Farinella, CEO, stated, "This is another very important step in the process for Michael James Enterprises, Inc. (MJE). Operationally we began the process this week of creating the samples for the acne treatment system. These samples are expected to be ready in early January 2016 for delivery to the independent verification group to begin before and after pictures, competitive products comparisons, testimonials and the like. We are highly confident of what the results will be because private testing of the product has already been conducted. I am very excited to complete the acquisition of MJE into BNBI in the very near future."
"The imminent filing of the registration statement is an important step in our plan to establish BullsNBears Holdings as a separately traded public entity," said James Palladino, the Chairman and CEO of the post spun-off BullsNBears Holdings. "We are confident that establishing these two highly focused companies, each with its optimal corporate structure, will allow our shareholders to more fully benefit from the compelling value creation opportunities associated with each business."
The spin-off will be effected by a distribution of BullsNBears Holdings shares on a pro-rata basis to the shareholders of the Company as of the November 20, 2015 record date as previously announced as a special dividend. The registration statement includes a preliminary information statement about the terms and conditions of the spin-off, as well as important information about BullsNBears Holdings as a standalone business, including BullsNBears Holdings financial information and operating growth strategies. Shareholders who want more information regarding the spin-off of BullsNBears Holdings, including the potential benefits and risks associated with the transaction, should review the registration statement, which will be available on the SEC's website www.sec.gov.
The completion of the spin-off is subject to a number of conditions including the receipt of a favorable opinion with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for federal income tax purposes and final approval by the new Michael James Enterprises board of directors. The spin-off is not subject to Michael James Enterprises shareholder vote.
All shareholders should be advised that certain online stock quote sources might not immediately report the new name and ticker effectively. Regardless, the Company is expected to trade as usual.
About BullsNBears.com, Inc.
BullsNBears.com, Inc. is a developmental stage company, focused on developing a Social Media Financial networking platform to be used by companies and individuals in the Financial Community.
About Michael James Enterprises, Inc.

These factors include, but are not limited to:


	·


	our recent exit from shell status, lack of profitable operations and risk we will ever generate revenues or profits,


	·


	need for additional capital, including our ability to repay $345,210 in notes to non-related parties, all of which if not paid off will convert into common stock over time causing dilution to all shareeholders,


	·


	our ability to continue as a going concern,


	·


	the limited operating history of our business,


	·


	our inability to manage our growth,


	·


	potential infringement of first party intellectual property rights,


	·


	our ability to effectively compete,


	·


	our ability to timely and effectively scale our technology,

	the limited trading market for our common stock which is quoted on the OTC Markets,


	·


	anti-takeover aspects of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the ability of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder consent,


	·


	the application of penny stock rules to trading in our common stock, and


	·


	the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible notes and warrants.





	You should read thoroughly this report and the documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and/or worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements including those made in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors appearing elsewhere in this report. Other sections of this report include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events.

	MICHAEL JAMES ENTERPRISES, INC.




	(formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.)









	Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements






	1.



	Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business






	The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Michael James Enterprises, Inc. (formerly BullsnBears.com, Inc.) (the


	“


	Company

	”

	) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the


	“


	SEC

	”

	). We suggest that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC. We believe that all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein and that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year as reported in Form 10-K have been omitted.





	We are a Company focused on developing intellectual property, contracting out the manufacturing of the products covered by the intellectual property and bringing to market these products through direct to consumer sales utilizing digital media, infomercials as well as distribution through third party vendors and retail outlets. Our first product LUNA is an alchemy of essential oils and peptide. The Company has begun to generate limited sales of LUNA at $20 per unit selling approximately 70 10 milliliter bottles. Currently the main product the Company is working toward manufacturing and developing a market for is VOLUPTAS, a female sexual arousal enhancer. A provisional patent for VOLUPTAS has been filed and the Company is currently engaged with a manufacturer in Texas to create 3D molds and will take the product through all of the necessary stability tests required over the next approximately 6 months in preparation to bring this product to market. Final pricing for the VOLUPTAS has not been decided upon, but the expected price is in the $39.95 range. The Company is also looking to partner with third party companies to collaborate with them on marking and distributing private label products under the MJTV brand.





	Our goal is to create a well known brand and distribution network that will not only serve as a viable sales and distribution channel for the Company

	’

	s products, but also for third party vendors and their products. The Company is focused on branding its catch phrase

	“

	Beauty Backed By Science

	”

	. Meaning, science backed products that enhance the inner beauty as well as the outer beauty of all people, with an emphasis on women. The Company has also launched a new marketing campaign with a new logo in the shape of a woman with words written inside of the woman describing

	“

	what is a beautiful woman.

	”

	We call this woman

	“

	BEAUTY

	”

	.  






	Competition






	Most of our competitors are well-established networks that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. However, these large companies are Bio Pharmaceutical companies such as, Palatin Technologies and AMAG Pharmaceutical, partnering on a female sexual dysfunction product that has completed phase 3 trials. These two companies expect to go through the FDA approval






	7






	process in order to bring their product to market as an FDA approved drug, and will begin the that process in the middle to late 2018. It customarily takes about 2 years to get through the FDA approval process, without certainty of getting final approval. MJTV will be bringing VOLUPTAS to the market as an over-the-counter product and will not be making any specific medical claims. Additionally, their delivery method is an auto-inject EPI Pen into the woman

	’

	s stomach. Our delivery method is a non-invasive application. A provisional patent has been filed protecting multiple delivery methods making entry by a third party very difficult.  We feel strongly that we will be to market before Palatin and AMAG, and that our delivery method will be widely accepted and viewed more favorable than an injection into the stomach.  Other competitors include sex dust (tree bark powder) that has been considered not effective with side effects including upset stomach and vomiting.  ADI is also on the market as an FDA approved female sexual dysfunction drug, but is also not considered very effective which has led to very limited sales. There are several vaginal gels on the market that claim to help excite a women providing tingling or warming sensations. There is also an established market for essential oils making the entry of LUNA, and other soon to be developed essential oil mixtures, difficult for MJTV to penetrate and gain market share in this essential oil segment. There are no assurances that we will ever effectively compete in our target market.









	Acquisition of RP Capital In Place Of The Proposed Acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. [Nevada]






	On August 4, 2016, the company

	’

	s Board of Directors approved an asset purchase agreement with RP Capital Group, Ltd. to acquire all rights and title to the studies and intellectual property to a dranabinol based treatment for sleep apnea. This acquisition substituted the contemplated acquisition of Michael James Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The Michael James Enterprises, Inc acquisition did not move forward as the acne based product it was bringing to marked has experienced several significant set backs and the Board of Directors has determined that the proposed agreement was not in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.  









	Our History






	We were organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010 under the name Spicy Gourmet International, Inc. as part of the implementation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. ("SGO"), a California corporation. SGO was incorporated in the State of California in 2006 and was formed to import specialty, organic spices from South Asia and sell them in the United States. SGO was undercapitalized and sales of its spice products were slow to develop, possibly due to the recession in the 2007-2008 time period. As a result SGO lacked sufficient cash flow to meet its current obligations and on October 1, 2010 SGO filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. SGO's plan of reorganization was confirmed by the Court on November 19, 2010.





	The plan of reorganization provided for the acquisition by SGO of a new, unrelated, retail business and the spin-off of all of the various elements of SGO's spice business to four different entities. The plan of reorganization called for the spin-off of SGO's manufacturing business to our company, the incorporation of our company, and the distribution of shares of our common stock to the bankruptcy creditors. The plan required us to issue 1,180,000 shares of our common stock and distribute these to SGO's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholders. The shares were distributed pursuant to Section 1145 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.









	8






	The Court also ordered the distribution of warrants to all administrative creditors of SGO, with these creditors to receive five warrants exercisable into shares of our common stock for each $0.05 of SGO's administrative debt which they held. These creditors received an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants consisting of:





	·


	1,000,000 "A Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00;


	·


	1,000,000 "B Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00;


	·


	1,000,000 "C Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00;


	·


	1,000,000 "D Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00; and


	·


	1,000,000 "E Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00.





	All warrants are exercisable at any time prior to November 19, 2017 as a result of a two-year extension. This warrants distribution also took place on December 30, 2010. During October 2012, we agreed to reduce the exercise price of the outstanding warrants to $0.25 per share.





	We were a

	“

	shell company

	”

	as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 from our date of incorporation until October 2012.





	On October 20, 2012, we acquired from James M. Palladino, then an unrelated third party, the URL domain name and websites of bullsnbears.com for $150,000. Following this asset purchase we were no longer considered a

	“

	shell company.

	”

	On October 23, 2012, our former officers and directors resigned and certain of the then officers and directors were appointed, with the balance of our directors being newly appointed in December 2012.





	In November 2012 we changed our name to BullsnBears.com, Inc. Effective December 11, 2015, we changed our name to Michael James Enterprises, Inc., and entered into an Agreement for Plan of Merger and Reorganization between the Company and Michael James Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation.  On August 4, 2016, the Company changed its direction and decided to acquire RP Capital Group, Ltd. and all of its intellectual property associated with a Dronabinol based treatment for sleep apnea. Additionally, the Company decided to develop and bring to market a female sexual arousal enhancer

	–

	VOLUPTAS. Trademark and patent aplications were filed and the Company is currently in the process of securing $2,500,000 of funding to manufacture and bring to market this product. There is no guarantee these funds will be raised.





	On December 31, 2015, the Company formed a new wholly-owned company, BullsnBears Holdings, LLC., for the purpose of holding the Company


	’


	s intellectual property assets.  As contractually agreed to, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, BullsnBears, Holdings LLC. was spun off in its entirety including all of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including certain liabilities of the parent company that were incurred by the previous management including BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. Intellectual Property assets, including its websites, URL

	’

	s, and proprietary software, were






	9






	tranfrred through a share dividend to MJTV shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 28, 2016, with one share of BullsnBears Holdings, LLC.  Common Stock distributed for each one share of MJTV Common Stock owned as of the record date.  Distribution of the shares took place on December 28, 2016.





	Prior to that, effective December 11, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment to the Company

	’

	s Articles of Incorporation changing the Company

	’

	s name to

	“

	Michael James Enterprises Inc.

	”

	and filed with FINRA for a new stock ticker symbol

	“

	MJTV

	”

	. Since August of 2016 the Company created the alchemy of essential oils called LUNA to help a person relax and hopefully achieve better sleep. Additionally, the Company

	’

	s CEO, James M. Farinella, designed a creative non invasive delivery system for an active ingredient which was assigned to the company by the CEO in exchange for
	2,35
	0,000 Preferred B shares. This product VOLUPTAS, now patent pending with a filing for a trademark on the Name VOLUPTAS. On April 12, 2017, the Company changes its name to MJ Biotech, Inc. to better represent the new direction of the Company.









	Going Concern






	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period from inception through March 31, 2017, the Company has generated minimal revenues and has an accumulated deficit of ($19,216,165). The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, its ability to generate profits from the Company

	’

	s future operations, identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company

	’

	s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.









	10







	Principles of Consolidation



	The accompanying financial statements reflect the the individual financial statements of Michael James Enterprises, Inc. taking into account the spin off of BullsnBears Holdings, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.



	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share



	The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including convertible debt, stock options, and warrants, using the treasury stock method, and convertible securities, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company had net losses as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, so the diluted EPS excluded all dilutive potential shares in the diluted EPS because their effect is anti-dilutive. As of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company also had outstanding convertible note that could be converted into 535,716 shares and 650,716 shares as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. However, these notes were included in the spin off of BullsnBears Holdings, LLC, on December 28, 2016.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The fair value of the derivative liabilities have been valued using a Black Scholes valuation model.



	Derivative Liabilities



	Certain of the Company

	’

	s convertible notes payable described in Note 3 contain conversion features that qualify for embedded derivative classification. The Company accounts for the embedded derivative features in its convertible debentures in accordance FASB ASC 815-10-

	Derivatives and Hedging,

	which requires a periodic valuation of their fair value and a corresponding recognition of liabilities associated with such derivatives. The recognition of derivative liabilities related to the issuance of the convertible debt is applied first to the proceeds of such issuance as a debt discount, at the date of issuance, and the excess of derivative liabilities over the proceeds is recognized as a

	”

	Loss on Derivative Liability

	”

	in other expense. The fair value of these liabilities will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments.

	New Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (

	“

	FASB

	”

	) issued Accounting Standards Update (

	“

	ASU

	”

	) 2014-15

	“

	Presentation of Financial Statements

	—

	Going Concern,

	”

	outlining management

	’

	s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity

	’

	s ability to continue as a going concern, along with the required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to our financial statements as a result of this change.


	 


	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (

	“

	ASU 2015-03

	”

	). ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements, by requiring them to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. There is no change to the current guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. For public business entities, ASU 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01

	“

	Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,

	”

	which revises an entity

	’

	s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances.

	”

	The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01 on its financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases at the commencement date a lease liability, which is a lessee

	’

	s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee

	’

	s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation

	—

	Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including treatment of excess tax benefits and forfeitures, as well as consideration of minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The ASU will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company is evaluating the future impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	Other relevant recently issued accounting updates are not expected to have a material impact on the Company

	’

	s consolidated financial statements.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.







	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures






	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive who also serves as our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.









	21






	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of continuing weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.









	Changes in internal control over financial reporting






	There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
