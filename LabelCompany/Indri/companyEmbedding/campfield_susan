Creative Inking Blog Hop: Two Step Stamping




Welcome! Thank you for stopping by - I have a fresh and summery card for you today!

I created this card with the Delightful Daisy stamp set and coordinating punch.  This stamp set is considered a "two step" stamping because the stem is a separate image so you can stamp it as step 1 in one color (Old Olive was used here) and then in step 2 stamp the flower in a separate color (Crushed Curry).  I also used the Layered Leaves embossing folder for the background and the Softly Falling embossing folder for the flower centers.

I stamped the flower two times on Crushed Curry card stock and punched out both flowers with the Daisy punch. The I cut the flowers in half to change the daisies into brown eyed Susan flowers! NOTE: This new punch has out sold every other punch we have carried the last 5 years.  Because of the extreme popularity Stampin' Up! it is currently out of stock. The punch (and the bundle that includes the punch and the stamp set) are currently not able to be ordered until (approximately) the first week in August.  If you would like to be notified when the punch is available to order, contact your demonstrator!

The greeting is from the Flourishing Phrases stamp set.  I stamped it in Early Espresso and cut it out with the Layering Ovals Dies.  The Crushed Curry 3/8" Mini Chevron ribbon was the perfect accent!

The flower center is punched out with the 1/2" circle punch.  Additional products used are listed below!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Bundle Extravaganza! 




Our theme this month is all about the bundles  - bundles are two or more products that are sold together at a discount.  My customers LOVE the bundles because these are products that are MADE to go together and you can SAVE money!!  I have several favorite bundles in this new catalog so it was tough to decide which one to focus on today.  But in the end I just had to go with the Colorful Seasons and Season Layers Framelit Thinlits Dies.  I LOVE the versatility of this bundle and I know I will be using it in every season of the year!  

This card was made using mostly the dies (except the outside sentiment which is from the stamp set).

And this card was made using just the stamps from the Colorful Season set.  

As you can see by the HUGE number of dies in this set, I've barely cracked the surface on all the possibilities with this great bundle!  

Both cards also feature the beautiful Color Theory designer paper stack.  This pretty paper is in a 6" x 6" stack and features and ombre and paint chip look on one side and a crackle design on the other.

I love this Adirondack chair from the die set - it just says "summer" to me!!  And the peek of the branches and Color Theory paper through the oval window adds a lot of depth to this card.

Here is a peek at the inside of the card - the greetings are from the Happy Birthday Gorgeous stamp set (which is part of another great bundle!)

I used the multipurpose liquid glue to attach the branch and mini glue dots to attach the flowers. 
Here is a quick peek inside the Berry Burst card - I used the Better Together stamp set for the inside of this card.
I hope you give this bundle a try - it is a lot of fun!!

Time to see what bundle B.J. Peters is focusing on today!

Or you can go back and visit Sue Lehrer and see her favorite bundle!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: What Goes Around




Our hop theme this month is circles so I chose the beautiful dies from the Eastern Palace Suite!

A simple card with lots of elegance in Vanilla and Dapper Denim.

I started with an 11" x 4 1/2" piece of Vanilla and cut the detailed circle from the Eastern Medallion Thinlit dies and then laid a circle from the Layering Circle dies in the center.

After cutting that out, I laid a piece of 4" x 5 1/4" piece of Vanilla behind the front piece and using the top piece as a guide to center one of the smaller detailed circle dies from the Eastern Medallion Thinlits.

Then I removed the top piece to place the next die.

I love the laser cut look of these dies and how the Eastern Beauty stamp set was designed to coordinate with this set.

The inside piece is attached with Dimensionals to give the card depth.

This fabulous bundle is available NOW from your Stampin' Up! demonstrator!!  You will be amazed with all of the things you can create!
 

Time to hop along to see what B.J. Peters has created!

Or you can hop back to see Sue Lehrer's project! Thanks for taking part in our hop today!

Triple Flap Fun Fold and more with Eastern Palace Suite




I have been having fun creating with the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle and I'm excited to share my creations with you!  This card is a fun fold - if you receive my free newsletter Monday you got this step by step project sheet. Sign up for my newsletter today to get next week's project! Scroll down for more creations!

The Triple Fold card when it is open - the belly band keeps this card closed.

This fold is our technique for my technique club next week.  If you live in the Minneapolis / St. Paul area and would like to join my technique club let me know!

When we make our technique we make a full size card, an instruction label and a mini card. This is the mini card! Love the gold vinyl stickers and the new Fresh Fig ink and card stock that come with the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle and the Eastern Palace Starter Bundle!

These unique dies make a partial cut - so lovely!

The dies come with the Premier Bundle and they are amazing!  As you can see by the die in the lower right corner, they partner well with our Layering Circle Dies!  

The Premier Bundle also comes with these fun tassels - so perfect for graduation time or to dress up a project!

This Glassine Gift Bag (retiring at the end of this month and only available while supplies last!) is the perfect size for some cards - either full size with the envelope or notecard size.  The Premier Bundle comes with two free gifts - the new Thick Very Vanilla cardstock and a pack of Very Vanilla Envelopes.  The Starter Bundle comes with a free gift of the new Very Vanilla Note Cards & Envelopes.

The dies make beautiful "laser cut" type windows in cards - so stunning! The paper at the bottom of this card is from the Eastern Palace Specialty Designer Paper Pack with is included in both bundles. It has two single sided sheets with gold foil accents and 2 each of 5 double sided additional designs.

These are all the fun goodies that come in the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle - including three of the new InColor Ink Pads (Lemon Lime Twist, Fresh Fig, and Tranquil Tide). This special bundle with two free gifts is only available until the end of May. In June you can purchase the items individually or the stamp set and dies as a bundle.

The Eastern Palace Starter Bundle has lots of fun items too - click on the photo above for additional details! Don't forget to sign up for my free newsletter for a beautiful project sheet each week.  Thanks for stopping by today - happy stamping!

Beautiful Blue Ombre Butterflies with the Beautiful Wings Embosslit!




Another bright, happy, spring card today!!  This one I'm playing with the Ombre look again.  Ombre is very big right now - in clothes, fabric, nail art, and hair color!  What is Ombre?  It is a french word that means shaded - typically varying shades of the same color from light to dark.  We are making this card in my Big Shot Classes this week - I hope you can join us!

Some of the Stampin' Up! colors fit perfectly for the ombre technique!!  For my butterflies I've used Soft Sky, Pool Party, Coastal Cabana, and Bermuda Bay.

To cut out the butterflies I used an embosslit for the Big Shot Die-Cut Machine called Beautiful Wings Embosslit.  Not only does it cut out all of the butterfly shapes, but it also embosses a different design on each - as you can see in this close up.

I'm really happy with how this card turned out - I love the clean, crisp look of white on white with just a dash of color!  I used the new Arrows embossing folder for the background.  the Coastal Cabana Ruffle Stretch Trim added just the right touch at the bottom of the card!  Thanks for stopping by today!

"Bee" My Valentine With the Hexagon Hive 




I wanted to share this adorable Valentine card with you today.  I used the new Hexagon Hive Thinlits Die for the Big Shot on this one.  

This is a cool new die from the Occasions Catalog but there are some tips I wanted to share with you for getting the best results from this beautiful die.  You need to use wax paper between the die and the card stock when you send it through the machine.  This helps the card stock come out of the die without tearing those thin borders.  I also found that with my Big Shot machine I needed to add an extra piece of card stock between the magnetic platform and the bottom plate to "shim".  What stunning results you will get if you do these two simple things!

The "Crazy Mixed Up Love" stamp set had the perfect image for this card with the little bee. I added some Dazzling Diamonds Glitter to his wings to make him sparkle and punched him out with the Hexagon punch (of course!).   I also popped the hive cut out up on dimensionals so it would really standout - I also think it adds depth to the card, don't you agree?

Here is a quick peek at the inside of the card.  This image is from the Delightful Dozen set.

The Pink Pirouette ribbon made a nice finishing touch to the card, and it helps draw the eye to the bee which is the focal point.  
Thanks for stopping by today!

Stunning Hardwood Masculine Valentine




I absolutely love this new Hardwood background stamp from Stampin' Up!  It's a showstopper!  This is one of the Hearts and Valentine's cards we made at my class earlier this month.  If you are near the Twin City area in Minnesota I would love for you to join one of my classes!

Here is a peek at the inside of the card.  The "Love You" image is from a new set called "Love You To The Moon".

I made a heart shaped "window" by using the Hearts A Flutter Framelits after I stamped the image. The 2nd heart is attached with one of the new Mini Metallic Clothespins from the Occasions Catalog.  You get gold and silver - on this card, we used the gold clothespins. The smaller heart that is clipped to the clothespin is from the Hearts Collection Framelit - but you could also use the small heart punch, it would just be a bit smaller.

The card stock colors are Baked Brown Sugar and Early Espresso and the ink color is Early Espresso.  The Hardwood background stamp is a must have for masculine and "outdoorsy" cards - I can tell I will be using it a lot!  To order yours, click here.

I Lava You! Crazy, Mixed-Up Love Valentine




This is a great valentine for a teen or a special card to give to your sweetie any time of the year!  Black and red can be so striking, don't you agree? The new Banner Collection Framelits really jazzed up the card and the speckle stamp from the Gorgeous Grunge set adds some interest.

This was one of the cards we made in my Hearts and Valentin'e Class.  To get the multiple colors on the image we used a technique called "paper piecing".  First, we stamped the image in Real Red on Whisper White and cut it out with the Banner Collection Framelits.  Then, on another piece of Whisper White, we stamped the lava lamp image in StazOn Jet Black ink.  Then we took the black stamped image and cut out the pieces of the lamp that we wanted to be black - in this case, the base and top of the lamp.  Then we glued them over the red version using the Two Way Glue Pen.  

For the inside of the card we used a stamp set Tags 4 You that was in the Holiday Catalog and is still availabe to order.  We punched it out with the Label Bracket Punch.  The speckle stamp from the Gorgeous Grunge was used again to tie it in with the design on the front of the card.

The designer paper strips on the bottom come from the Neutrals Paper Stack. This great pad of paper has 40 sheets of double sided designer papers in 10 neutral colors, you get 4 of each color.  Have fun making Valentine cards for your loved ones!  If you need to order supplies, click here to go to my store.

Sweet and Simple With The Christmas Collectibles Set





This fast and easy card is on our Note Cards and Envelopes - it would make a quick Christmas card or a great Christmas thank you card. I used the Christmas Collectibles bundle which includes the set and matching punch:

I stamped the ornament in Cherry Cobbler and attached a little Baker's Twine using the Multi Purpose Liquid Glue:


The greeting is an inexpensive single stamp from the Holiday Catalog called "Be Very Merry":


Happy Stamping!

Perfect Blend in the mail!



I love going to the mail box and finding a personal card - especially a hand stamped one!  Yesterday was one of those fun mail days!  I got this great card from my Stampin' Up! "mom", Cherie Manderschied.


Isn't it cute?!  I love the color combo - Crumb Cake, Early Espresso, and Costal Cabana.  And the Perfect Blend is such a unique and fun set!

Cherie is the person who I signed up with when I became a Stampin' Up! demonstrator 16 years ago - we call it "upline".  She is my coach, my cheerleader, my inspiration, and my support.  And I do the same for all those who I have the privilege to be upline to!  Here is a close up of this cute card!

Is there someone you could cheer up by sending a card to?  This one sure made my day!  Happy stamping!

Easter Carrot Treat Box!




Yay - time for a quick project for this weekend's Easter festivities. See my Facebook Live video below where I walk you through how to make this simple box!  If you don't have these supplies on hand you may want to pick them up now for next year.  Many of them are retiring including the Cutie Pie Thinlits that I used to make the box!  I used the Seaside Embossing folder to make the lines on my carrot...

The soon to be retiring Emerald Envy Ruched Ribbon made perfect "greens" at the top of my carrot. See the video for details!

These bunny and carrot stamps are seriously adorable!!  They are on the retiring list along with the matching dies - pick yours up before they sell out!!  See the video below for tips on how I colored the bunny and the carrots. Love the matching framelits dies so that I did not have to do any fussy cutting!

This is the first Facebook Live video tutorial I have done that is live to the public!!  I was a bit nervous so hopefully it makes sense!  

I filled my box with the Carrot Cake Hershey Kisses that are out for Easter this year - yum!  They taste like cream cheese frosting!!  Thanks for stopping by - happy paper crafting!
CLICK HERE TO PLACE YOUR ORDER in my online store 24-7 or click any of the pictures below to go directly to that specific item online. Hurry!!  Many of this supplies are retiring and are only available while supplies last!!

Film Day Friday: Snowman Soup K Cup Version!



 
Yay! A cute little gift to make and share!  This is an update of a classic winter craft called "Snowman Soup" but I adapted it for a K cup!  If the recipient does not have access to a Keurig Machine they can just open the K Cup and add hot water - video tutorial below!

Inside are some yummy goodies to add to the hot cocoa to make it extra delicious and sweet!

These White Gift Boxes by Stampin' Up! come with a plastic sleeve.  The boxes are ready to decorate - just fold and assemble.  (Watch the video if you have any questions on how to fold the bottom of the box.)

Some simple punch art was used to make the snowman, I used the Holly Builder Punch to add some Christmas Cheer - if you are making this to give in January you may want to embellish the hat with a snowflake instead.

Here is a link to the document I used for the poem. Or you can type your own using the words from the photo above.

The Warmth & Cheer paper was perfect for this project - this paper is retiring at the end of this month AND it's 50% off right now as part of the Year-End Closeout but only while supplies last!

One of the Layering Circle Framelits Dies is the PERFECT size for the K-Cup.  Watch the video below for the specifics on which circle...
 

Here is the step by step video - let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you so much for stopping by today!  Be sure to pick up your Warmth & Cheer paper here before it sells out!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Spooky Fun




 
Ready for some spooky fun?!  Just 40 days until Halloween! 
I'm excited to share this double Z fold card today!  Fun and easy with the Stampin' Up! Halloween Scene Edgelits! Check out my short video tutorial below!

This card opens.....

Like this!  So lots of FUN going on inside the card! Below is the dimensions and the short video on how to make this double Z.
 
Here is a short video walking you through how to make this card. 
Dimensions:
Basic Black:     4 1/4" x 11" scored at 2 3/4" and 5 1/2"
                            1" x 11" scored at 2 3/4" and 5 1/2"
                            3" x 4"
Basic Gray:        3" x 4"
Pumpkin Pie:    3 1/4" x 4 1/4"
                            1 1/4" x 2 1/4"
                            scrap for greetings
Whisper White: 2 1/2" x 4"

This card has a moving arm (the 1" x 11" piece) that makes the double z. 

The tree die in this set is unique because it cuts the "grass" but does not cut at the bottom, so you can have as much "ground" showing as you want - it just depends where you place the die and what the size of your paper is.

I placed my tree die like this on the 3" x 4" black piece - I had some extra space up in the corner so I decided to cut out the bat from that area - waste not, want not!  I also cut out my little jack-o-lanterns at the same time so I did not have to crank through twice.

The cute paper is from the Halloween Night Specialty Designer Series Paper - love it!!  Thanks for joining me tonight!  

Time to hop along to see what cute project Amber has in store for us!!

OR, if you prefer, you can hop back to see Sue Lehrer's spooky fun project!!
CLICK HERE TO PLACE YOUR ORDER in my online store 24-7 or click any of the pictures below to go directly to that specific item online. When I use stamp sets for a project I give you both the wood and clear mount options - that way you and pick your favorite!

Whip-it Wednesday: Candy Cane Lane Reindeer Diagonal Cut Technique!




Happy Whip-it Wednesday where we celebrate the quick and easy (and cute)!! I'm excited to show you this super easy diagonal cut technique which you can adapt to any patterned paper that you have! I have short video below and a photo of the super simple cut. 

So easy that you can make a lot of this card layout in a hurry - perfect for your holiday cards.
  
Here is the short video - not fancy but it shows you how!  I'm still dealing with the broken arm and editing a video is a challenge with only one hand. So it's not fancy but I think it does the job!!

Although you can make the diagonal cut any where, I wanted all my cards to be the same - so I used these dimensions. This photo also shows how to cut paper that has a directional pattern, like this one. 

 After I have cut it with the Stampin' Trimmer.

A peek at the inside of the card with a different pattern from the same package of paper.

To embellish my card I used an adorable stamp set and punch bundle called Cookie Cutter Christmas!

I did some simple coloring with the new Real Red / Crumb Cake marker twin pack from the Stampin' Up! Holiday Catalog.

Or if you don't like to color you can skip the antlers and just color the nose and the inside of the ears like I did on this version. These little jingle bells are adorable - and they really jingle!! You get both silver and red in the package of bells and the baker's twine is also a two pack with both colors.  So what are you waiting for?! Grab some patterned paper and a trimmer and give it a try!!

Pups are growing and keeping me amused while my broken arm heals.

We got a new hammock so that we can hang outside with the pups more and enjoy the gorgeous fall weather. Thanks for stopping by! Be sure to check out the NEW adds to the Clearance Rack!!

Easy And Adorable Treat Totes with the Envelope Punch Board!




I have such fun projects to share with you today! I was asked by Splitcoaststampers, a well known paper crafting website, to make a tutorial using the envelope punchboard for their extensive resources section of their website - what an honor to be asked!

These little cuties are quick and easy to make.  And SO fun to decorate!  Watch the tutorial below and then scroll down to see just some of the many boxes I made!
 
Here is the video tutorial! If you prefer a photo tutorial go to Splitcoaststampers for step by step instryctions.

This is my favorite "go to" punch board project - this cute little tote (or bag in a box) that was originally designed by UK demonstrator Sam Hammond. 

I had a lot of fun playing with the brand new products from the upcoming Stampin' Up!® Holiday Catalog to decorate mine! Including this GORGEOUS Petals & Paisleys Designer Paper, Copper Sheets, and Paisley Framelit Dies!

Here is what the tote looks like from the top.

Of course the Foxy Friends stamp set and Fox Builder punch look adorable on this project too!

In addition to a ribbon closure you can use a paper clip - or make the clip functional AND cute with the Bow Paper Clips. This box is made with the Affectionately Yours Designer Paper and the Love & Affection stamp set. 

One more to share, this cute Sweet Sugarplum version - I love this unusual color for wintery cards! This one is made from the Envelope Paper which is quite thin.  If you use a thin paper like this place layer of printer paper on it before you punch out the handle - otherwise it will tear and not cut. The layering circle is the Dazzling Diamonds Glimmer Paper - which did not photograph well but is wonderfully sparkly in person! At the center is a Fancy Frost Sequin to add even more sparkle!
Thanks for stopping by today! Check out all the fabulous products from the Holiday Catalog here!
CLICK HERE TO PLACE YOUR ORDER in my online store 24-7 or click any of the pictures or name of the item on the bulleted list below to go directly to that specific item online.  Holiday catalog items are available tomorrow!

This Penguin Is Dressed For St. Patrick's Day!




It's almost time for St. Patrick's Day!  Or, should I say, Saint "Patties" day?!  Because this little penguin has some yummy peppermint "patties" to share!  Video tutorial below!
 
Scroll down to see the full list of supplies!

I love a stamp set with matching framelits - this cute penguin comes from the Snow Place Bundle that has carried over from the Stampin' Up! Holiday catalog.  I love the versatility of this set - the snowmen from the set I will probably only use seasonally but the penguin can be used year round!! 

The Pumpkin Pie marker added some color to the beak and feet (I love to color penguins - you only have to do a little coloring - lol!).  I used a green permanent marker to color the rhinestone for his hat.

The cute background is from the Color Me Irresistible Specialty Designer Series Paper pack, I used the Cucumber Crush sheet and cut it 3" x 4".  (Note: this pack has colored sheets and also comes with white ones pre-embossed with the patterns.  These sheets can be colored in your choice with your sponge and an ink pad). 

I typed up the greeting on my computer and punched it out with the Extra Large Oval Punch. Here is the link to the document that I created:   Download Happy Saint Patties   The shamrock was created with a variety of punches - see the video below for the "how to" and all the paper measurements!

 Thank you for visiting today!  Full supply list is below - have a wonderful St. Patrick's Day!!
Susan

Kitten Mini Tic Tac Slider Box



 
Yay! I'm super excited to share this darling little project with you today!  So easy to make - video tutorial is below!

Just pull on the ribbon....

and up slides some mini Tic Tacs!!  I purchased my mini Tic Tacs at Walgreens.  I understand they also can be found at dollar stores (particularly Dollar Tree by the check out register).
 
Here is the short video walking you through how to cut and score the sleeve.  This pattern came from Erica Cerwin at www.pinkbuckaroodesigns.blogspot.com. Cut paper at 2 1/4" x 4 1/4".  Then score at 1 3/8", 1 7/8", 3 1/4", and 3 3/4".
I used the Friends & Flowers stamp set and the coordinating punch which you can purchase by clicking on the name or in the supply list below. The punch can also be purchased as a bundle with a different coordinating stamp set.  If there are a lot of Stampin' Up! products you would like then the best deal right now is to purchase the Starter Kit (which is the ultimate bundle)- $155 of awesome craft supplies of your choice for just $99.  E-mail me for more information on the starter kit deal or click here.

The kitten is really a bunny, I just punched out the ears, cut them down, and put the pointy side up!  Thanks so much for visiting today!

Valentine Animal Pyramid Boxes




I was honored to be asked by Splitcoaststampers to do a tutorial for a Valentine Treat Holder - I had fun with the Pyramid Pals Thinlits Dies and Playful Pals stamp set! 

I love the stamp set - I can get a perfect, cute face every time instead of hand drawing the image!  Step by step video is at the bottom of the post!

The backside of the mouse shows the recipient how to open the box without destroying it! For closure details, see the video tutorial.

These boxes are smaller then they appear in the pictures.  As you can see, one Lindt Truffle fills it up!

Ribbit!  The matching set of dies has the frog leg and eye dies so no fussy cutting involved with this project!

This one opens just like the mouse.

And here is the box when opened.

I love this little lion!  His mane is made with one of the dies in the set.  I cut 4 of the fringe dies and curled them with the bone folder.  For the "bangs" I cut down a piece to just 6 "fringes". 

Before I assembled the lion I punched an opening in the side with the 1" Circle Punch.

I printed my own greeting on my computer!

This little Elephant was super quick and easy - again the matching dies cut out the ears and trunk!

I cut the back panel off completely for easy treat access.  The tabs help keep the treat inside the box.

All these fun stamp images come in the set - ust think of the fun animals you could create!

Dies to match - the stamps are see through Photopolymer so you can cut the pieces and then stamp on them - just flip for left and right.

Purchase a BUNDLE and save!  Click on the photo above to order!
 
Here is the video tutorial!

Full supplies are listed below - have a blast creating your own Pyramid Animal boxes!!

Whip-it Wednesday: Stunning Christmas Pines Gift Card Holder!




Simple and elegant - my favorite kind of project!  This gift card holder is a snap with the Stampin' Up! Gift Card Envelope Die and the Big Shot Die-Cutting Machine!  Some simple stamping with the Christmas Pines set and look how pretty!!

Here is the backside of the project! I love this Kraft card stock - great, rich color!

Instead of a gift card you could put a treat in this fun little envelope - what a happy surprise to leave on your coworkers desktop!

I used the 1/8" handheld punch to make a hole for the ribbon - I threaded the ribbon through the hole, then threaded the mini pinecones on to the ribbon, and then I tied the bow.

The greeting was stamped in Real Red ink, cut out with one of the ovals from the Stitched Shapes Framelit Dies and attached to the project with a Dimensional. The I brushed the Clear Wink of Stella Glitter pen over the word "Sparkle" to add some....well, sparkle!

All done and ready to gift! Sometimes gift cards feel like I'm cheating so if I spend a little time making a hand made gift card holder it shows I put some care into their gift.

Checking in with our Whip-it Wednesday mascots, my Whippet pups. My parents started a Christmas Tree Farm in southern Iowa when I was a little girl and I still go down to help out on the farm. Our opening weekend for tree sales is always Thanksgiving and this year the puppies got to go!  They loved running around the farm! Please forgive my scruffy farm appearance but make up is not a priority down on the farm - hiking and enjoying nature is the priority! Thanks for stopping by today - I appreciate you visiting!!

Sneak Peek! Inside The Lines Coming For Sale-A-Bration 2017!!




Today Stampin' Up! demonstrators get to preorder from the upcoming Occasions Catalog and earn FREE Sale-a-bration products with their preorder! If you have thought about joining the Stampin' Up! family this is a great time to give it a try! Today's card features a new Sale-A-Bration Designer Paper called Inside The Lines.  Customers can get this paper FREE starting January 4th with a $50 order.  

The cute greeting (love that font) is just one of the great stamps from the stamp set called So In Love in the Occasions Catalog. I colored it with the Pink Pirouette, Melon Mambo, and Pear Pizzazz markers. The finished size for this card is 4" x 5 1/2" so that I could get the most out of my 12" x 12" paper.

For the inside of the card I attached a 1" x 5 1/2" strip along the bottom and used another great greeting from the So In Love stamp set.

The finishing touch is a bit of 5/8" Organza ribbon tied in a knot and attached with a glue dot.  I love the look of this paper and with this technique, very little coloring is involved! If you join now as a demonstrator you will get to select $125 in products for $99 - those products can be from the new Occasions catalog, the Annual Catalog or the Holiday Catalog - your choice.  You do not earn Sale-A-Bration benefits on your starter kit otfrt (because you are already getting a big discount), but after you have ordered your starter kit, any other orders you choose to place in December, January, February, or March will qualify for Sale-A-Bration benefits.  To learn more about joining, click here or contact me, I would love to chat with you about any questions you have!

Speaking of my Stampfield Stars team members, in a past post I showed you the outside of the gift I was giving to my team members who were attending the Stampin' Up! OnStage Training in early November. Inside was a clear tiny treat box decorated with the Warmth & Cheer paper and the fox from the Jolly Friends set.  The box held some sponges to encourage them to absorb all of the great stamping ideas and techniques that were demonstrated.

My team members who attended also received a team ribbon to add to their name badge and a chocolate treat.  

Here are the finished boxes that I took with me to the Madison OnStage event!  Thanks for stopping by today! 

Be sure to check out the BRAND NEW CLOSE OUT SALE that started today!! Click here for the details!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Farewell to Favorites!





Welcome to the Creative Inking Blog Hop starring my "Favorite Retiring Stamp Set". Now that is a tough one because I have many favorites.  So I'm going with "Favorite Retiring Set This Week"! Because it really does change daily!.

Right now I have been using So Very Happy, a lot!  I just adore that wee little owl!!  Let me show you a few of the projects I've made with it!

I was inspired by another demonstrator to add a balloon to this owl's hand - and now I always add one! I drew a string with the Project Life Journaling Pens, punched out a 1/2" circle of the Birthday Bash paper and placed an Itty Bitty Accents Epoxy Sticker over it - an instant shiny balloon. 

Here is a quick peek at the inside of the card.

And here is an apology card with a package of Itty Bitty Accents Epoxy Stickers - this time I used the heart shaped one with the Itty Bitty Accents Punches.

And last week at my Goodies for Grads class this little owl "graduated"!  The balloon is back again.  But this time our little owl is wearing his very own graduation cap! I simply stamped an extra "Congrats Grad" greeting (from the Blue Ribbon stamp set, also retiring) on a scrap piece and cut out just the hat. This is actually the inside of the project….

Here is the outside!  The outside was inspired by a swap I received from demonstrator Lee Ann Furness. This is actually one of the Gift Card Enclosure Pack from Stampin' Up! decorated with a square of black card stock, a Candy Dot on a Brad Base, and a tassel from Baker's Twine.  To learn how to make a tassel, watch demonstrator Dawn Olchefske's excellent video here.
 
One last project - a throwback from last summer!  I used the "to you from me" stamp from So Very Happy on the back of this cute Watermelon Box.  Last chance to get YOUR own So Very Happy Set before it is gone forever!!
Time to hop along to the next blog, to see wonderful things from Linda Bauwin or skip back to see Diane Evans's creations! Happy hopping!

Wow Them With A Santa Gift Card Holder and Santa Box!




The holidays are coming!  Plan ahead this year and make a gaggle (a herd? a hoard?) of darling Santa boxes and Santa gift card holders with the Fry Box Die and Mustache Framelit!  The Mustache Framelit is part of this weeks WEEKLY DEALS - get it for less! Scroll to the bottom of this post for ALL the weekly deals. For the picture tutorial for this project, just scroll down!

 The beard comes from the Labels Collection framelits, 4th size in from the outside. I cut it out of the Dazzling Diamonds Glimmer paper, and then cut it in half. Wow, this paper really sparkles!!  So "Christmasy"!

For the belt, I cut a 5 1/2" x 3/4" strip of Basic Black card stock, then I laid it on the Fry Box die in the approximate location that I wanted the belt, and cut it out with the Big Shot.  The buckle is a 1" square of Silver Glimmer Paper and a 3/4" square of Basic Black.  When you use the Fry Box die, use a Premium Crease pad in place of the top cutting pad - this will give you the nice scoring for the creases.

All the sizes are the same, whether you are making the box OR the gift card holder. The only difference is the assembly.  To make the gift card holder, follow the steps below:





Ready for a gift card!

Or you can just assemble the box as is and fill with lovely treats - like these white chocolate truffles!

Whip-It Wednesday on a Thursday - Fall Treat Holder with For All Things and the Gift Card Die




Happy fall!  I was having so much fun yesterday teaching my Back to School Triple Treat Holder class that I neglected to post!  So sorry!  I will be sharing the Back to School project soon, but today we are going to talk about this quick and easy treat holder - easy to "whip" up a whole batch to give out to teachers, friends, and coworkers this fall!  

Here is a picture of the back side that shows the treat.  I am once again using the mini Ghirardelli Choclates - they are so cute!  This is made with the Gift Card Envelope Thinlits Die for the Big Shot and could hold a gift card instead.  Or wait, how about BOTH - a gift card AND some chocolate!

When you order the Gift Card & Trims Thinlits Dies to use in your Big Shot, you get some tags and embellishments too!

We used the long skinny tag die for this project (in my Big Shot Class last week) - we cut two, one in Cajun and the Vanilla. 

The Hello Fall tag was stamped using the gorgeous new stamp set from the Holdiay catalog - love it!
 
The "Color Me Autumn" Designer Series Paper is so pretty and the Mossy Meadow ribbon adds the perfect finishing touch!

Enjoy fall to the fullest by making some lovely gifts or cards to brighten the days of others! Click here to go to the store and see all the fun new Holiday Catalog projects!

And I will leave you with a photo of our Whippet Bella.  Looking a bit sulky here at the Renaissance Festival this past weekend - I don't think dressing up in costume is her favorite activity!

Whip-it Wednesday - Treats For Grads!




I have several things to share today!  The first is a super fast Whip-it Wednesday project that you could give a grad or a group of grads.  These graduation cap Rolo treats are quick and easy to make!  See below for the list of supplies.

Of course, you could sweeten the deal by throwing in a "diploma" with the treat.  I went with that tried and true grad gift - cash!

If you have a bit more time, why not "upcycle" that old Stampin' Up! embellishment container into a cute graduation hat box to hold your gifties?!

The inside greeting is from the Pomp & Circumstance stamp set in the Occasions Catalog.  It is not in the new catalog so this is your last chance to pick up this cute set!

This is what the box looks like when it is closed.  Dawn Olchefske has a great video on how to make the tassel out of Baker's Twine. Click here to watch it. I wanted my tassel to be a bit longer so I used a 17" piece and two 6" pieces to make my tassel.  I also increased the template to 1 1/2" wide so that my tassel strands would be longer.

Check out the supply list below and stop in the store to pick up the items you need for this project!

Hey Grad - You've Got A Text! Smart Phone Gift Card Holder




 Another fun graduation gift card holder!  I've been seeing cards like these using our digital MDS program - but I wanted to try doing one with punches and stamps.  Super fun to make, and even funner to give to that "smart phone addicted" grad that you know!  Scroll to the bottom of this post to see the full list of supplies needed.  Then stop in to the "store" to get what you need!

 Here is a quick peek at the inside of the gift card holder.  To see how I made the slot for the gift card, see my other gift card holder post here.

The diploma stamp has some other words on it - so I masked those off and then stamped the Happy Graduation from Teeny Tiny wishes there instead.   To see how to do that, check out this project here, where I used a similar technique on an alligator word stamp.
This is my project from the back side.  As you can see, the cover with the phone on it is larger then the gift card holder part.

I used this framelit shape from the Chalk Talk set of framelits for the "speaker". I cut it out of Basic Black card stock with the Big Shot.
 

Then, using my scissors, I cut off the "hump" on the bottom to make it look more like the speaker on a smart phone.

This card was inspired by a card made by Beth Daniels.  You can see Beth's version by clicking here.  Thank you for the inspiration Beth!  Thank you for stopping by today!

An Extrowl-ordinary Graduation Money and Chocolate Holder!!




So cash is really the traditional gift for a grad - but I get bored giving it in the same old traditional way.  So why not dress it up and present it in style! Today's project is an adorable mini folder with a Ghirardelli Chocolate inside and some cash.  This is just one of the fun projects that we made at my Graduation Gift Cards and Goodies class.  Scroll down for the video tutorial and the full supply list!

I typed up this saying on my computer and printed it out on card stock, then I punched it out with the 1 1/4" circle punch.

Inside our cute little mini file folder, the mint and a folded up bill fit perfectly! How fun to hand this to your favorite grad when you walk in to their party!  The mini file folder project was created by demonstrator Jini Merck.  You can see Jini's version here.

Our adorable grad owl is wearing spectacles and a graduation cap!  Below is the video tutorial.  
  
The first section is on how to make the mini file folder using the Envelope Punch Board.  The second section I show how to make the darling little mortarboard and the spectacle wearing owl!

Thanks for stopping by today and letting me share this fun project with you!  Pick up your paper crafting supplies in the store by clicking here.

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Two Step Stamping




Welcome! Thank you for stopping by - I have a fresh and summery card for you today!

I created this card with the Delightful Daisy stamp set and coordinating punch.  This stamp set is considered a "two step" stamping because the stem is a separate image so you can stamp it as step 1 in one color (Old Olive was used here) and then in step 2 stamp the flower in a separate color (Crushed Curry).  I also used the Layered Leaves embossing folder for the background and the Softly Falling embossing folder for the flower centers.

I stamped the flower two times on Crushed Curry card stock and punched out both flowers with the Daisy punch. The I cut the flowers in half to change the daisies into brown eyed Susan flowers! NOTE: This new punch has out sold every other punch we have carried the last 5 years.  Because of the extreme popularity Stampin' Up! it is currently out of stock. The punch (and the bundle that includes the punch and the stamp set) are currently not able to be ordered until (approximately) the first week in August.  If you would like to be notified when the punch is available to order, contact your demonstrator!

The greeting is from the Flourishing Phrases stamp set.  I stamped it in Early Espresso and cut it out with the Layering Ovals Dies.  The Crushed Curry 3/8" Mini Chevron ribbon was the perfect accent!

The flower center is punched out with the 1/2" circle punch.  Additional products used are listed below!

Time to hop along and see what fantastic project BJ Peters has for us today!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Bundle Extravaganza! 




Our theme this month is all about the bundles  - bundles are two or more products that are sold together at a discount.  My customers LOVE the bundles because these are products that are MADE to go together and you can SAVE money!!  I have several favorite bundles in this new catalog so it was tough to decide which one to focus on today.  But in the end I just had to go with the Colorful Seasons and Season Layers Framelit Thinlits Dies.  I LOVE the versatility of this bundle and I know I will be using it in every season of the year!  

This card was made using mostly the dies (except the outside sentiment which is from the stamp set).

And this card was made using just the stamps from the Colorful Season set.  

As you can see by the HUGE number of dies in this set, I've barely cracked the surface on all the possibilities with this great bundle!  

Both cards also feature the beautiful Color Theory designer paper stack.  This pretty paper is in a 6" x 6" stack and features and ombre and paint chip look on one side and a crackle design on the other.

I love this Adirondack chair from the die set - it just says "summer" to me!!  And the peek of the branches and Color Theory paper through the oval window adds a lot of depth to this card.

Here is a peek at the inside of the card - the greetings are from the Happy Birthday Gorgeous stamp set (which is part of another great bundle!)

I used the multipurpose liquid glue to attach the branch and mini glue dots to attach the flowers. 
Here is a quick peek inside the Berry Burst card - I used the Better Together stamp set for the inside of this card.
I hope you give this bundle a try - it is a lot of fun!!

Time to see what bundle B.J. Peters is focusing on today!

Or you can go back and visit Sue Lehrer and see her favorite bundle!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: What Goes Around




Our hop theme this month is circles so I chose the beautiful dies from the Eastern Palace Suite!

A simple card with lots of elegance in Vanilla and Dapper Denim.

I started with an 11" x 4 1/2" piece of Vanilla and cut the detailed circle from the Eastern Medallion Thinlit dies and then laid a circle from the Layering Circle dies in the center.

After cutting that out, I laid a piece of 4" x 5 1/4" piece of Vanilla behind the front piece and using the top piece as a guide to center one of the smaller detailed circle dies from the Eastern Medallion Thinlits.

Then I removed the top piece to place the next die.

I love the laser cut look of these dies and how the Eastern Beauty stamp set was designed to coordinate with this set.

The inside piece is attached with Dimensionals to give the card depth.

This fabulous bundle is available NOW from your Stampin' Up! demonstrator!!  You will be amazed with all of the things you can create!
 

Time to hop along to see what B.J. Peters has created!

Triple Flap Fun Fold and more with Eastern Palace Suite




I have been having fun creating with the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle and I'm excited to share my creations with you!  This card is a fun fold - if you receive my free newsletter Monday you got this step by step project sheet. Sign up for my newsletter today to get next week's project! Scroll down for more creations!

The Triple Fold card when it is open - the belly band keeps this card closed.

This fold is our technique for my technique club next week.  If you live in the Minneapolis / St. Paul area and would like to join my technique club let me know!

When we make our technique we make a full size card, an instruction label and a mini card. This is the mini card! Love the gold vinyl stickers and the new Fresh Fig ink and card stock that come with the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle and the Eastern Palace Starter Bundle!

These unique dies make a partial cut - so lovely!

The dies come with the Premier Bundle and they are amazing!  As you can see by the die in the lower right corner, they partner well with our Layering Circle Dies!  

The Premier Bundle also comes with these fun tassels - so perfect for graduation time or to dress up a project!

This Glassine Gift Bag (retiring at the end of this month and only available while supplies last!) is the perfect size for some cards - either full size with the envelope or notecard size.  The Premier Bundle comes with two free gifts - the new Thick Very Vanilla cardstock and a pack of Very Vanilla Envelopes.  The Starter Bundle comes with a free gift of the new Very Vanilla Note Cards & Envelopes.

The dies make beautiful "laser cut" type windows in cards - so stunning! The paper at the bottom of this card is from the Eastern Palace Specialty Designer Paper Pack with is included in both bundles. It has two single sided sheets with gold foil accents and 2 each of 5 double sided additional designs.

These are all the fun goodies that come in the Eastern Palace Premier Bundle - including three of the new InColor Ink Pads (Lemon Lime Twist, Fresh Fig, and Tranquil Tide). This special bundle with two free gifts is only available until the end of May. In June you can purchase the items individually or the stamp set and dies as a bundle.

The Eastern Palace Starter Bundle has lots of fun items too - click on the photo above for additional details! Don't forget to sign up for my free newsletter for a beautiful project sheet each week.  Thanks for stopping by today - happy stamping!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Designer Paper Showcase




This month our hop theme is focusing on some the beautiful Stampin' Up! papers!! I am also excited to share this fun fold: the Peek-a-boo gatefold!

My card features the beautiful Succulent Garden designer series paper - so beautiful!  This is the front of the card - as you can see in the center you get a peek of the inside of the card. I used the fun Timelss Tag dies - you can insert different cut outs into the tag, I choose the butterflies for this card.

And this is the inside of the card.

Here is a side view of the card opening so that you can see the "gatefold" portion. I saw a horizontal version of this fold on Chris Slogar's blog and decided to make a vertical version. 

Here are the dimensions to make this fun fold!

I had to up-cycle my cut out butterflies from the tag on the front of the card for the inside - just could not waste those cute butterflies!

I added a dimensional between the white tag and the sugarplum tag to get some "depth" for the butterflies.  Thanks for stopping by today!  Be sure and visit the next stop on the hop:

Beautiful Spotlight Technique With Watercolor Pencils




I love this easy "shortcut" method of watercoloring called the Spotlight Technique! I will walk you through the technique with step by step on how to watercolor with the watercolor pencils.  These pencils have been a HUGELY popular and are currently on low inventory status.  Once they sell out we will not be getting more inventory until April so order yours today here!

This beautiful floral scene is actually preprinted designer paper called "Inside the Lines". It is available FREE with a $50 Stampin' Up! purchase through the end of March (or while supplies last).  For the Spotlight technique you punch out one area that you want to highlight. After punching you color just that area and then punch a slightly larger circle to layer it on.  This circle (Basic Black on this card) makes the image "POP"!

The inside of the card with the So In Love stamp set.

Watercolor pencils can be used as colored pencils, or as a paint with the blender pens.  To get the shading variations I follow this technique.  First I lightly color the image all over with my main color, barely pressing at all, to get a light base.  If you are going to be blending it with the blender pen it does not have to be pretty or fill in all the areas - just a light base coat.  I'm using the Rich Razzleberry pencil here.

Next I go back in with the same color pencil and press firmly in areas that I want to "shade". I like to shade on the bold lines of the image. Again, it does not have to be smooth and perfect, that will happen with the blender pen.

With your blender pen, start by blending all of the light areas.  Then use a circular motion to blend the darker areas being careful to leave some light areas.  A juicy blender pen will give you a smoother look.  When you are done with the Razzleberry blending scribble your blender pen on a scrap paper until it turns clear again before moving on to the yellow flower center.
 

I used the Daffodil Delight pencil all over and a little Pumpkin Pie for shading on the center.

The darks and lights make a dramatic statement on your finished card!

Storage tip: I store my watercolor pencils in a Clear-Mount Stamp Case so that I can easily see all of my color options.

The Watercolor Pencils are easy to use and make you look like a professional artist!  Don't forget to order your watercolor pencils in Stampin' Up! exclusive colors today before they sell out!!  Thanks for joining me today!  Full supplies are listed below!
CLICK HERE TO PLACE YOUR ORDER in my online store 24-7 or click any of the pictures below to go directly to that specific item online. When I use stamp sets for a project I give you both the wood and clear mount options - that way you can pick your favorite!

Creative Inking Blog Hop: Color My World




 
Today I want to share a couple of fun stamping techniques on this sweet Easter card made with the Basket Bunch / Basket Builder Framelits Dies!
First I will focus on the coloring since that is the theme of our Blog Hop today!

I stamped the images in StazOn Jet Black on Thick Whisper White card stock and then colored in a few parts of the image using the Stampin' Up! Watercolor pencils.  Specific colors used were Bermuda Bay, Melon Mambo, Daffodil Delight, and Basic Gray.

I then blended the pencil using the Clear Wink of Stella Glitter Brush and spread it to fill in the open areas.  I was nervous the first time I did this - I was afraid that the color would stain my Clear Wink of Stella.  But I quickly discovered all I need to do when I am done with one color is brush the tip on a scrap paper a few strokes and it will turn clear again.  Then I move on to the next color.

The Basic Gray was just a few strokes on each side of the face and sides to add shading.  Ta-da!  It gives you a beautiful professional coloring effect with a gorgeous shimmer throughout!

The card itself is called a Floating Image card - which worked perfectly with my egg juggling bunny!  I stamped the images from the Basket Bunch stamp set, colored them, and cut them out with the coordinating dies from the Basket Builder Framelits Dies. Then I attached them with glue dots to a piece of window plastic inside my window that I cut with the Layering Square Framelit dies.

I cut another set of images in plain white to put on the back side of the window to cover up the glue dots.

Here is a close up of the inside greeting!

Thanks for joining me today! Have fun trying out these two great stamping techniques on your own projects!

Time to hop on over to see what BJ Peters has created!

Or you can hop back and see Diane Evens creation!  Thanks for hopping with us!

Retiring Products & OnStage April 2017 Photos, News, Samples, Products...


What fun we have as Stampin' Up!® demonstrators. We just attended the April 2017 OnStage event and can now officially share photos, news, samples, products, etc!
But first let me tell you that today Stampin' Up! announced the products that will be retiring from the current 2016-17 Annual Catalog and the 2017 Occasions Catalog. CLICK HERE for that information. And be sure to take a good look at the list so that you don't miss out on getting products that you have wanted. Some things sell out quickly! You will also find information and important dates here on the upcoming 2017-18 Annual Catalog.
Speaking of the new catalog...
Ta-da!!

Isn't it pretty!?!
What a fantastic time we had at OnStage in Minneapolis, MN! After our initial episode in the hotel elevator, we quickly joined up with our friends at the CentreStage exclusive leadership event where we were treated to a beautiful dinner, extra training, a motivational speaker AND the new catalog earlier than all the other attendees.

And in the middle of each table were the 5 new 2017-19 In Colors! (Scroll down to see how these compare to a few other Stampin' Up! colors.)

My team member,Cheryl Lee attended with me. I have a lot to thank her for!

And we were blessed to also share a table with Linda Larson, Susan Campfield and Brenda Cardinal.

Getting the catalog early made it super hard to fall asleep that night, though. I think I may have only gotten about 5 hours total!

OnStage officially began the next morning. We were in line around 6:30 AM waiting for the doors to open. (Cheryl, me and Brenda Georgi)


I had 13 in my team join me at this Minneapolis location and then Pauline Poindexter attended in Toronto. Pictured above are JoAnn Pollock, Mackenzie Grimme, me, Sue Dyas (my "sister demonstrator"), Nancy Forsberg and Kayla Cory. Picture below are Lisa Nelson, Julie Haugen, Vicki Bibeau and Dawn Richard.

Getting the new catalog was THE BEST!

Beth Ferguson celebrated her 5 year anniversary with a walk across stage! Woo hoo!

Check out some of these demonstrations from OnStage showing some of the new stuff! (I've shared LOTS of photos, so I can't name everything. But hopefully you'll enjoy the photos anyway. I tried to show a variety.)












Do you want to see more?! Here are some of the display showing new products and new samples.
This first photo gives you a glimpse at the April Paper Pumpkin kit!!! Sign up (or make sure your account is active) before the end of today to get this fabulous kit designed by Sara Gardner. There are 12 cards in this kit, a new In Color, and the font is Sara's own handwriting. Yay!

There are more new kits that will be offered in the catalog...


And take a look at all these great product suites!













I've already purchased many of these things (because that's what us lucky demos can do!) so that I can start creating and sharing projects, cards, pages, classes and tutorials with all of you.
These are a few more photos I took of the display boards.





 
Once again here are the new 2017-19 In Colors that will be available soon.

And here are some quick color comparisons in case you are interested. (With photography the colors may be a little "off." But these comparison photos at least give you an idea on how the colors compare even if certain ones aren't as accurately shown in the photos.)





Hope that helps some of you who were curious. And I hope you enjoyed all that I shared today!

Once again here are the new 2017-19 In Colors that will be available soon.

And here are some quick color comparisons in case you are interested. (With photography the colors may be a little "off." But these comparison photos at least give you an idea on how the colors compare even if certain ones aren't as accurately shown in the photos.)





Hope that helps some of you who were curious. And I hope you enjoyed all that I shared today!

About Me


Susan Campfield
Independent Stampin' Up! Demonstrator
http://suestampfield.com
Why I do what I do: Stamping and creativity have always been my outlet for stress relief.  I love to sit down at my stamp desk and create – the stress just melts away!  As a Stampin’ Up! Demonstrator, I have the privilege of helping others get in touch with their creative side and reducing their stress too. I absolutely love sharing with my customers and my team of demonstrators creative ideas, inspirations, and my love of stamping.  In turn I get so much love and inspiration back from all of you!  When I create a hand stamped project, I’m making it to give to someone else to brighten their day, and that just makes me feel good.  
Customer Service: When you purchase Stampin’ Up! products from me you don’t only get some of the highest quality paper crafting supplies on the market, you also get my customer service and my knowledge of all things stamp related.  I have been a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator since 1997 and was an active stamper for several years prior to that – I have a wealth of knowledge to share!
“Stampfield Stars” demonstrators: I am blessed to be the leader of a fabulous group of stampers who have become demonstrators through me.  In turn, I get to be their coach and their cheerleader as they build their own Stampin’ Up! niche – whether their goal is to be a hobby demonstrator and get the discount on their own purchases; a part-time demonstrator who sells to friends and family; or a “career” demonstrator who works this business full time. As part of the Stampin' Up! family, team members receive great demonstrator discounts and benefits.  Join by purchasing the Stampin' Up! Demonstrator Starter Kit.
My History: I was born and raised in Cedar Rapids, IA.  After graduating from the University of Iowa, I moved to the Minneapolis area in Minnesota and have been here ever since!  I share my home with my wonderfully supportive husband Mike, and our sweet son Joe joined our family in 2001.  Our four legged companion is Bella, a Whippet (a smaller version of a greyhound) and she brings a lot of unconditional love to our home.
 

Bella the Whippet
My previous jobs in the corporate world have all been in customer service and that is still my number one focus.  In 1997 I decided to join Stampin’ Up! and turn my hobby that I loved into a job that I loved.  I was worried that my beloved hobby would become like “work” to me but fortunately that has not been the case!  I count my blessings of being a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator every day!  It has given me the opportunity to build lifelong friendships with stampers – customers, members of my Stampfield Stars team, and my other fellow demonstrators.  Being a Stampin’ up! demonstrator has also let me spend valuable time with my family by working from home.  I love what I do!!
STAMPIN' UP! ACHIEVEMENTS:

Executive Level Title
I have earned 12 Incentive Trips from Stampin’ Up!
Presenter at the Stampin’ Up! 2011 Convention
Presenter at the Stampin’ Up! Minneapolis Regional Seminar 2009
Convention Display Stamper 2004

Interests and Hobbies: Reading (particularly Jane Austen and other classic novels), going to movies, teaching Sunday School, volunteering at my son’s school, listening to audio books, jogging with my dog, and helping my extended family with our Christmas Tree Farm in southern Iowa.
