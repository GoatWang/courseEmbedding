Technically, he knows his brands and products very well and I appreciate that he always finds creative and honest ways to make sure they are a good fit for our company and customers. He is constantly working to ensure success both for his brands and for my company, which is why the brands he represents have a decades-long history of being among the fastest growing and the biggest sellers at Sweetwater.

David has been great at developing professional and personal relationships with virtually every department and every person in my company.  We all like him and trust him! With his outstanding track record, David has proven himself to be the best of the best and why Sweetwater will support any line that David represents.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

David made the jump from retail to wholesale when he joined International Music Company which at the time was representing some of the hottest lines in the industry like Charvel / Jackson and Akai. Roland US saw David’s success at IMC and hired him. He enjoyed a 23 year run with Roland, working his way up from District Sales Manager to National Accounts Manager then to Director of Sales / National Accounts. During that time he was a two time winner of the Chairman’s Award and numerous Superior Awards. Building Holloway Sales has been by far the most exciting and rewarding part of David’s career.

Ted then worked at Guitar Center in Pro Audio and Technology Sales and all levels of management in Detroit and St. Louis. Ted was hired by Roland US to cover the critical Los Angeles market in 2003. After successfully managing that, Ted moved to Michigan to cover the Ohio Valley territory when David joined Roland management. Ted won numerous awards for sales with Roland and Boss while at Roland.

Most of the dealers in the Holloway Sales region have known and respected Mary for many years.

  David established a very strong rapport with dealers both large and small over the years. He became a valuable partner assisting them in managing their business. No doubt, this musical instrument retails sales experience gave him keen insight into the needs of the dealers and their employees. David’s enthusiasm and love of music and musical instruments is evident to all who meet him. He is extremely talented both technically and musically. David is well known for this well put together and delivered presentations and new concepts. He has spent countless hours teaching the dealers and their staff the products features and operations. David is always willing to take on extra responsibility and go the extra mile to get things accomplished. He is an enthusiastic collaborator and successful in creating and implementing many successful dealer promotions. On a separate note, I always enjoy David’s dry sense of humor and upbeat and positive attitude. He is an asset to any organization.Chris BristolPast Chairman, President, and CEO of Roland Corp US
After more than 23 years working with David Holloway, he’s become much more than just a sales representative – he has become a trusted friend and an important partner for Sweetwater. David is always ready with a solution, he knows or can find the answers to questions, and he always represents his lines with complete professionalism. Technically, he knows his brands and products very well and I appreciate that he always finds creative and honest ways to make sure they are a good fit for our company and customers. He is constantly working to ensure success both for his brands and for my company, which is why the brands he represents have a decades-long history of being among the fastest growing and the biggest sellers at Sweetwater. For David it is not about selling products into Sweetwater, but rather, making sure that all my Sales Engineers know his products very well and enthusiastically want to sell them. David has been great at developing professional and personal relationships with virtually every department and every person in my company. We all like him and trust him! With his outstanding track record, David has proven himself to be the best of the best and why Sweetwater will support any line that David represents. If you have any questions about David’s ability or success at Sweetwater, I strongly encourage you to contact me. I’d love to tell you more.
Chuck SurackFounder & CEO of Sweetwater
David Holloway is a seasoned professional. He has always shown extraordinary attention to details – and that makes a huge difference in dealer and customer satisfaction.
