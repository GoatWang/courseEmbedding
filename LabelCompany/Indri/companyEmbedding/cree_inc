Cree, Inc. is an American worldwide manufacturer and marketer of lighting-class LEDs, lighting products and products for power and radio frequency (RF) applications. Most of its products are based on silicon carbide (SiC), a rare, naturally occurring mineral compound which early Cree researchers successfully synthesized in a laboratory. SiC enables higher performance in applications which require high endurance and in semiconductor devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both.[2] With the establishment of a reliable source for high-quality SiC, the firm expanded into several market segments with products that provided significantly higher performance and efficiency.[2] Cree's product families include LED lighting systems and bulbs, blue and green LED chips, high-brightness LEDs, lighting-class power LEDs, and a portfolio of SiC-based and wide bandgap SiC-on-GaN (gallium nitride) power-switching and RF (radio frequency) devices.
These products enable applications that include general illumination, electronic signs and signals, industrial power supplies and inverters, and military, satellite and broadband telecommunications.

History[edit]




Cree's high-power LEDs, XLamp 7090 XR-E Q4






A Cree 9.5 watt 800 lumen dimmable lamp bulb, with 2700 K color temperature, introduced in March 2013


Cree was founded in July 1987 in Durham, North Carolina. Five of the six founders – Thomas Coleman, John Edmond, Eric Hunter, John Palmour and Calvin Carter – are graduates of North Carolina State University.[3]
In 1983, the founders -– one a research assistant professor and the others student researchers – were seeking ways to leverage the properties of silicon carbide to enable semiconductors to operate at higher operating temperatures and power levels.[3] They also knew silicon carbide could serve as the diode in light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a light source first demonstrated in 1907 with an electrically-charged diode of SiC.
The research team devised a way to grow silicon crystals in the laboratory, and in 1987 founded a company, Cree Research, Inc., to produce SiC and exploit its usage commercially in both semiconductors and lighting. The founders raised money to establish office and laboratory facilities and entered a period of steady technological advancements.[3]
In 1989, the company introduced the world's first blue LED, which enabled the development of large, full-color video screens and billboards.[3]
In 1991, Cree released the world's first commercial silicon carbide wafer.[3]
In 1993, Cree launched an initial public offering.
In 1999, the company name is changed from Cree Research to Cree, Inc.[4]
In 2001, Cree had grown to about 1000 employees.[3]
In 2011 Cree acquired Ruud Lighting, a national firm experienced in the use of LED for outdoor lighting. This expanded Cree sales channels and led to a new generation of lighting-class LED components.[5]
In 2012 Cree announced the XLamp XT-E, which was claimed to deliver twice as much light for the same price as older LEDs.[6]
In October 2013, Cree's first consumer products, two household LED bulbs qualified for Energy Star rating by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.[7]
In 2014, Cree introduced a series of dimmable 40 and 60 watt LED bulbs specifically designed to match the classic A-19 shape; that year Cree established an exclusive relationship with home improvement chain Home Depot to distribute Cree LED bulbs.[8]
In 2015, Cree acquired Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) combining the resources of two established firms which make components for high-performance power modules. The collaboration led to multiple government contracts, including one for a SiC-based vehicle charger for hybrid electric vehicles for the U.S. Dept. of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).[9]
In July 2016, German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it agreed to buy Cree's Wolfspeed business unit (RF and power electronics devices) for $850 million in cash.[10] However, the deal was called off in February 2017 after the companies were unable to resolve regulators’ national security concerns.[11]
Industry firsts[edit]

First GaN HEMT MMIC grown on SiC
First viable LED downlights and LED streetlights
First viable lighting-class LED lamp
First viable LED PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector) lamp
First LED troffer
First sub-$200 LED streetlight
First SiC MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) (2012)[12]

Industry recognition[edit]

In 2015 Cree was named to Fast Company's list of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World,[13] and No. 1 the Energy sector.[14]
Inc. magazine named Cree to its list of the Most Innovative Startups of 2015.[15]
Cree was featured in the MIT Technology Review of 50 Smartest Companies (2014).[16]
Cree was included in the Deloitte 2014 Technology Fast 500 (2014).[17]
Cree was named to Forbes Top 25 Fastest Growing Tech Companies. (2013)[18]
Awarded ENERGY STAR® qualifications for LR6, LR5 and LR4 LED downlights (April 2009)[19]

Corporate affairs[edit]

As of June 28, 2015, Cree had 6,387 employees.[2]
Cree owns 204 acres in Durham, NC, where it has its headquarters, primary research & development operations, and a manufacturing facility. Its products are produced in Durham; Racine, WI; Florence, Italy; and Huizhou, Guangdong Province, China. They also maintain sales and support offices through subsidiaries in leased office space in North America, Asia and Europe.[2]
As of January 2015, Cree holds or has applied for more than 4000 patents in the U.S. and worldwide.[20]
Subsidiary companies include APEI (Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc.), Cree LED Lighting Solutions, Cree Japan Limited, Cree Europe GmbH, Cree Hong Kong Ltd., Cree Microwave, LLC, and Cree Asia Pacific Ltd.[21]

Licensing[edit]
Cree allows other companies access to its proprietary or patented technology through a formal intellectual property licensing program, as part of their strategy to accelerate the adoption of LED and other products in new and developing markets. With thousands of granted patents in over twenty countries around the world, Cree's technologies encompass new materials systems, such as Group III nitrides and silicon carbide, compound semiconductor devices for LED lighting, wireless and power applications, and LED-based systems, such as LCD backlighting systems and general illumination systems. A license to Cree's patents can enable other companies to improve existing products, enter new markets or speed time-to-market of new products.[20]

Cree, Inc. is an American worldwide manufacturer and marketer of lighting-class LEDs, lighting products and products for power and radio frequency (RF) applications. Most of its products are based on silicon carbide (SiC), a rare, naturally occurring mineral compound which early Cree researchers successfully synthesized in a laboratory. SiC enables higher performance in applications which require high endurance and in semiconductor devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both.[2] With the establishment of a reliable source for high-quality SiC, the firm expanded into several market segments with products that provided significantly higher performance and efficiency.[2] Cree's product families include LED lighting systems and bulbs, blue and green LED chips, high-brightness LEDs, lighting-class power LEDs, and a portfolio of SiC-based and wide bandgap SiC-on-GaN (gallium nitride) power-switching and RF (radio frequency) devices.
These products enable applications that include general illumination, electronic signs and signals, industrial power supplies and inverters, and military, satellite and broadband telecommunications.

History[edit]




Cree's high-power LEDs, XLamp 7090 XR-E Q4






A Cree 9.5 watt 800 lumen dimmable lamp bulb, with 2700 K color temperature, introduced in March 2013


Cree was founded in July 1987 in Durham, North Carolina. Five of the six founders – Thomas Coleman, John Edmond, Eric Hunter, John Palmour and Calvin Carter – are graduates of North Carolina State University.[3]
In 1983, the founders -– one a research assistant professor and the others student researchers – were seeking ways to leverage the properties of silicon carbide to enable semiconductors to operate at higher operating temperatures and power levels.[3] They also knew silicon carbide could serve as the diode in light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a light source first demonstrated in 1907 with an electrically-charged diode of SiC.
The research team devised a way to grow silicon crystals in the laboratory, and in 1987 founded a company, Cree Research, Inc., to produce SiC and exploit its usage commercially in both semiconductors and lighting. The founders raised money to establish office and laboratory facilities and entered a period of steady technological advancements.[3]
In 1989, the company introduced the world's first blue LED, which enabled the development of large, full-color video screens and billboards.[3]
In 1991, Cree released the world's first commercial silicon carbide wafer.[3]
In 1993, Cree launched an initial public offering.
In 1999, the company name is changed from Cree Research to Cree, Inc.[4]
In 2001, Cree had grown to about 1000 employees.[3]
In 2011 Cree acquired Ruud Lighting, a national firm experienced in the use of LED for outdoor lighting. This expanded Cree sales channels and led to a new generation of lighting-class LED components.[5]
In 2012 Cree announced the XLamp XT-E, which was claimed to deliver twice as much light for the same price as older LEDs.[6]
In October 2013, Cree's first consumer products, two household LED bulbs qualified for Energy Star rating by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.[7]
In 2014, Cree introduced a series of dimmable 40 and 60 watt LED bulbs specifically designed to match the classic A-19 shape; that year Cree established an exclusive relationship with home improvement chain Home Depot to distribute Cree LED bulbs.[8]
In 2015, Cree acquired Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) combining the resources of two established firms which make components for high-performance power modules. The collaboration led to multiple government contracts, including one for a SiC-based vehicle charger for hybrid electric vehicles for the U.S. Dept. of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).[9]
In July 2016, German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it agreed to buy Cree's Wolfspeed business unit (RF and power electronics devices) for $850 million in cash.[10] However, the deal was called off in February 2017 after the companies were unable to resolve regulators’ national security concerns.[11]
Industry firsts[edit]

First GaN HEMT MMIC grown on SiC
First viable LED downlights and LED streetlights
First viable lighting-class LED lamp
First viable LED PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector) lamp
First LED troffer
First sub-$200 LED streetlight
First SiC MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) (2012)[12]

Industry recognition[edit]

In 2015 Cree was named to Fast Company's list of the 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World,[13] and No. 1 the Energy sector.[14]
Inc. magazine named Cree to its list of the Most Innovative Startups of 2015.[15]
Cree was featured in the MIT Technology Review of 50 Smartest Companies (2014).[16]
Cree was included in the Deloitte 2014 Technology Fast 500 (2014).[17]
Cree was named to Forbes Top 25 Fastest Growing Tech Companies. (2013)[18]
Awarded ENERGY STAR® qualifications for LR6, LR5 and LR4 LED downlights (April 2009)[19]

Corporate affairs[edit]

As of June 28, 2015, Cree had 6,387 employees.[2]
Cree owns 204 acres in Durham, NC, where it has its headquarters, primary research & development operations, and a manufacturing facility. Its products are produced in Durham; Racine, WI; Florence, Italy; and Huizhou, Guangdong Province, China. They also maintain sales and support offices through subsidiaries in leased office space in North America, Asia and Europe.[2]
As of January 2015, Cree holds or has applied for more than 4000 patents in the U.S. and worldwide.[20]
Subsidiary companies include APEI (Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc.), Cree LED Lighting Solutions, Cree Japan Limited, Cree Europe GmbH, Cree Hong Kong Ltd., Cree Microwave, LLC, and Cree Asia Pacific Ltd.[21]

Licensing[edit]
Cree allows other companies access to its proprietary or patented technology through a formal intellectual property licensing program, as part of their strategy to accelerate the adoption of LED and other products in new and developing markets. With thousands of granted patents in over twenty countries around the world, Cree's technologies encompass new materials systems, such as Group III nitrides and silicon carbide, compound semiconductor devices for LED lighting, wireless and power applications, and LED-based systems, such as LCD backlighting systems and general illumination systems. A license to Cree's patents can enable other companies to improve existing products, enter new markets or speed time-to-market of new products.[20]

Cree, Inc. is an American worldwide manufacturer and marketer of lighting-class LEDs, lighting products and products for power and radio frequency (RF) applications. Most of its products are based on silicon carbide (SiC), a rare, naturally occurring mineral compound which early Cree researchers successfully synthesized in a laboratory. SiC enables higher performance in applications which require high endurance and in semiconductor devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both.[2] With the establishment of a reliable source for high-quality SiC, the firm expanded into several market segments with products that provided significantly higher performance and efficiency.[2] Cree's product families include LED lighting systems and bulbs, blue and green LED chips, high-brightness LEDs, lighting-class power LEDs, and a portfolio of SiC-based and wide bandgap SiC-on-GaN (gallium nitride) power-switching and RF (radio frequency) devices.
These products enable applications that include general illumination, electronic signs and signals, industrial power supplies and inverters, and military, satellite and broadband telecommunications.

History[edit]




Cree's high-power LEDs, XLamp 7090 XR-E Q4






A Cree 9.5 watt 800 lumen dimmable lamp bulb, with 2700 K color temperature, introduced in March 2013


Cree was founded in July 1987 in Durham, North Carolina. Five of the six founders – Thomas Coleman, John Edmond, Eric Hunter, John Palmour and Calvin Carter – are graduates of North Carolina State University.[3]
In 1983, the founders -– one a research assistant professor and the others student researchers – were seeking ways to leverage the properties of silicon carbide to enable semiconductors to operate at higher operating temperatures and power levels.[3] They also knew silicon carbide could serve as the diode in light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a light source first demonstrated in 1907 with an electrically-charged diode of SiC.
The research team devised a way to grow silicon crystals in the laboratory, and in 1987 founded a company, Cree Research, Inc., to produce SiC and exploit its usage commercially in both semiconductors and lighting. The founders raised money to establish office and laboratory facilities and entered a period of steady technological advancements.[3]
In 1989, the company introduced the world's first blue LED, which enabled the development of large, full-color video screens and billboards.[3]
In 1991, Cree released the world's first commercial silicon carbide wafer.[3]
In 1993, Cree launched an initial public offering.
In 1999, the company name is changed from Cree Research to Cree, Inc.[4]
In 2001, Cree had grown to about 1000 employees.[3]
In 2011 Cree acquired Ruud Lighting, a national firm experienced in the use of LED for outdoor lighting. This expanded Cree sales channels and led to a new generation of lighting-class LED components.[5]
In 2012 Cree announced the XLamp XT-E, which was claimed to deliver twice as much light for the same price as older LEDs.[6]
In October 2013, Cree's first consumer products, two household LED bulbs qualified for Energy Star rating by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.[7]
In 2014, Cree introduced a series of dimmable 40 and 60 watt LED bulbs specifically designed to match the classic A-19 shape; that year Cree established an exclusive relationship with home improvement chain Home Depot to distribute Cree LED bulbs.[8]
In 2015, Cree acquired Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. (APEI) combining the resources of two established firms which make components for high-performance power modules. The collaboration led to multiple government contracts, including one for a SiC-based vehicle charger for hybrid electric vehicles for the U.S. Dept. of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).[9]
In July 2016, German chip maker Infineon Technologies AG said it agreed to buy Cree's Wolfspeed business unit (RF and power electronics devices) for $850 million in cash.[10] However, the deal was called off in February 2017 after the companies were unable to resolve regulators’ national security concerns.[11]

Why work at Cree?
 We need problem-solvers, unconventional thinkers and impassioned doers who can drive rapid change by creating solutions that out-perform anything that has come before. Our people see opportunities others can't and pursue them relentlessly. 






Work with brilliance.
Relentless innovation is in our DNA. It is why we don’t stop at good. It’s why we strive for better. We are a leader in energy saving technology, as reflected by our 4,000+ patents. We are always looking for new ways to leverage our potential and create the future. Join us and challenge yourself.











Earth needs your help.
Cree is a leader in making energy-wasting technologies obsolete through developing energy-efficient, environmentally friendly LED technology and efficient Power/RF products.









Lead from the front.
Our focus is on innovation. Each day we’re disputing assumptions, questioning “accepted” theory and bulldozing through technological barriers. If you crave a fast-paced innovative creative environment, this is the place for you.











Forget red tape.
Bureaucracy and dogmatic thinking are not in our our company culture. We think fast, act fast and innovate fast.









Grow rapidly.
As a company of high achievers, we recognize achievement and reward it with more opportunity. At Cree, you can be part of a team creating the future of lighting, while rapidly developing your own career and skills.











Be passionate.
At Cree we work diligently to identify and hire only those people who are profoundly passionate about their work. Once hired, we ask our employees to solve real problems. We push them to think unconventionally, to take ownership, to push their limits and to encourage their teammates to overachieve. If you join us prepare to innovate.







How we hire
Our Commitment to You:We recognize that searching, applying, and interviewing for a new career is an important and often time-consuming undertaking, one that takes effort, focus, and persistence. We appreciate your interest in Cree and believe in a smooth, efficient, and transparent process for all candidates.
Cree has one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry. We think that's at least partly because we're thoughtful about considering skills, experience, passion, and culture fit in making every employment decision. Certainly, it is important for you as an applicant to set your own criteria and ensure that Cree is also a good fit for you.
To promote a positive candidate experience, we offer the following guidelines and information.

Cree
 - Cree leads the LED lighting revolution and is making energy-wasting traditional lighting technologies obsolete through the use of energy-efficient, environmentally friendly LED lighting.  Cree first brought the blue LED to market in 1989, and today Cree's XLamp® LEDs have continually exceeded industry standards for brightness and efficiency. Indeed, XLamp LEDs were the first "lighting-class" LEDs – LEDS bright enough to be used in general-illumination applications, such as desk lamps, ceiling fixtures and street lights. In addition, Cree's extensive line of high-brightness LEDs are also introducing new performance levels to outdoor video displays and decorative lighting.

Cree’s power and RF division is now known as Wolfspeed, A Cree Company. Wolfspeed is liberating power and wireless systems from the limitations of silicon by leading the innovation and commercialization of next-generation systems based on silicon carbide and gallium nitride.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Bulb Type-CFL bulbs are more and more frequently becoming the norm in the American household. With their long life span and bright shades CFL's are always a good option if you want a fixture that performs and saves you money every year.
 
-Fluorescent tubes are common in bath bars and come in many different styles such as the most common T4 and T5 bulbs.
 
-Halogen: these bulbs are known for their brightness and long life spans. Although these bulbs get quite hot they are a good solution if you are looking for ample amounts of light.
 
-Incandescent or Fluorescent: We have combined all the fixtures that can use either a CFL or a standard incandescent bulb into one simple location so you can choose whether you would like a more traditional setup or an energy saving CFL configuration.
 
-Xenon/Krypton: Much like their halogen counterparts are extremely bright bulbs with long lifespans that will use a Xenon or Krypton gas inside the bulb.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Cree - Better Color















Cree - Better Dimming















Cree - Better Warranty









Cree's new line of LEDs promise better performance at a lower price.
LED Lighting, with its low energy consumption, long life, and high quality, has made our world better and ended the century old era of traditional light. But for Cree, this is just the beginning. The technology behind LED will go beyond creating good light sources to deliver entirely new and vastly improved light experiences.

AT CREE, WE CALL THIS 'BETTER LIGHT' AND BELIEVE IT'S YOUR RIGHT. CHOOSE BETTER.

Cree understands that people prefer better light, and Cree's belief is that you cannot compromise when it comes to the light in your home or office. They have designed no-compromise, full featured LED bulbs that create dynamic spaces and enhance living spaces with beautiful light.

See for yourself why better light matters.
