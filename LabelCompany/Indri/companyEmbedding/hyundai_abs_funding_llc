Not applicable.
 
Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit

Not applicable.
 
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Certain
Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information).
 
Not applicable.
 
Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.
 
Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of
plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity
as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts.
The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche
Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses
to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert
causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged
breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and
that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
 
Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple
actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with
the most substantial case being: BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015
(N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond
Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned
Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than
100 trusts per case.
 

   
 

 
U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome
of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies
liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the
cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 
No other legal proceedings are pending, and
no legal proceedings are known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against any of Hyundai Capital America (the “Sponsor”
and “Servicer”), Hyundai ABS Funding, LLC (the “Depositor”), U.S. Bank National Association (the “Indenture
Trustee”) or Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2013-C (the “Issuing Entity”), or of which any property of the foregoing
is the subject, that are material to holders of the asset-backed notes or the certificates.
 
Item 1119 of Regulation AB. Affiliations
and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
 
Information contemplated by Item 1119 of Regulation
AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on Instruction to Item 1119 of Regulation AB.
 
Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance
with Applicable Servicing Criteria
 
The Servicer and the Indenture Trustee (together,
the “Servicing Parties”) have each been identified by the registrant as parties participating in the servicing function
with respect to the asset pool held by the Issuing Entity.  Each of the Servicing Parties has completed a report on an assessment
of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it (each, a “Servicing Report”), which Servicing Reports are
attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee has provided an attestation
report (each, an “Attestation Report”) by one or more independent registered public accounting firms, which reports
are also attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. None of the Servicing Reports prepared by any of the Servicing Parties, and none
of the related Attestation Reports, has identified any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable
to the respective Servicing Party.
 
Item 1123 of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance
Statement. 
 
The Servicer has been identified by the registrant
as a servicer with respect to the asset pool held by the Issuing Entity. The Servicer has completed a statement of compliance with
applicable servicing agreement (a “Compliance Statement”) signed by an authorized officer of the Servicer. The Compliance
Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

Conveyance of Receivables .

 

(a)          In
consideration of the Depositor’s delivery to the Seller on
the Closing Date of an amount equal to the estimated fair market
value of the Purchased Assets, which amount shall be paid (i) in
cash and (ii) by a capital contribution initially made by the
Seller to the Depositor (collectively, the “ Purchase
Price ”), the Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign,
set over and otherwise convey to the Depositor without recourse
(subject to the obligations of the Seller herein) all right, title,
and interest of the Seller in and to:

 

(i)          the
Receivables and all moneys identified thereon on or after the
Cutoff Date;

 

(ii)         the

(2016-B Receivables Purchase
Agreement)






 

 

(vi)        all
proceeds from any Receivable repurchased by a Dealer pursuant to a
Dealer Agreement; and

 

(vii)       the
proceeds of any and all of the foregoing (collectively, with the
assets listed in clauses (i) through (vi) above, the “
Purchased Assets ”).

 

The Depositor shall make payment in
respect of the Purchase Price upon demand by the Seller.

 

(b)          The
Seller and the Depositor intend that the transfer of the Purchased
Assets by the Seller to the Depositor pursuant to this Agreement be
a sale of the ownership interest in such assets to the Depositor,
rather than the mere granting of a security interest to secure a
borrowing. In the event, however, that such transfer is deemed not
to be a sale but to be of a mere security interest to secure a
borrowing or such transfer is otherwise not effective to sell the
Receivables and other property described in Section 2.01(a)
hereof, the Seller shall be deemed to have hereby granted to the
Depositor a perfected first priority security interest in all such
assets, and this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement
under applicable law. Pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement
and Section 7.04 hereof, the Depositor may sell, transfer
and assign to the Issuer (i) all or any portion of the assets
assigned to the Depositor hereunder, (ii) all or any portion of the
Depositor’s rights against the Seller under this Agreement
and (iii) all proceeds thereof. Such assignment may be made by the
Depositor with or without an assignment by the Depositor of its
rights under this Agreement, and without further notice to or
acknowledgement from the Seller. The Seller waives, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, all claims, causes of action and
remedies, whether legal or equitable (including any right of
setoff), against the Depositor or any assignee of the Depositor
relating to such action by the Depositor in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.

 

Section
2.02          The
Closing . The sale and purchase of the Receivables shall take
place at a closing at the offices of Mayer Brown LLP, 71 South
Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, on the Closing Date,
simultaneously with the closing under (a) the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, (b) the Indenture and (c) the Trust
Agreement.
 
ARTICLE III.

of the Closing Date on which the Depositor relies in accepting the
Purchased Assets and in transferring the Purchased Assets to the
Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and on which the
Issuer relies in pledging the same to the Indenture Trustee. Such
representations and warranties speak as of the Closing Date, but
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Purchased
Assets to the Depositor, the subsequent sale, transfer and

pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the pledge of the
same by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the

Organization and Good Standing . The Seller has been duly
organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the State of California, with the corporate power

(ii)         
Due Qualification . The Seller is duly qualified to do

(iii)        
Power and Authority . The Seller has the power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Basic Documents
to which it is a party and to carry out their respective terms; the

which the Seller is a party have been duly authorized by the Seller
by all necessary corporate action.

(iv)        
No Violation . The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Basic Documents to
which the Seller is a party and the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement and other Basic Documents to which it is a
party do not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) a default under, the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Seller, or any indenture, agreement
or other instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which it

any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement or other instrument (other than this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents), or violate any law or, to the
Seller’s knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable
to the Seller of any court or of any federal or state regulatory
body, administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality
having jurisdiction over the Seller or its properties. There shall
be no breach of the representations and warranties in this
paragraph resulting from any of the foregoing breaches, violations,
Liens or other matters which, individually or in the aggregate,

ability to perform its obligations under the Basic Documents or the
consummation of the transactions as contemplated by the Basic
Documents.

 

(v)         
No Proceedings . There are no proceedings or investigations
pending or, to the Seller’s knowledge, threatened in writing

the Seller is a party, (B) seeking to prevent the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Basic Document to which the Seller is a party or (C) seeking any
determination or ruling that would materially and adversely affect
the performance by the Seller of its obligations under, or the
validity or enforceability of, this Agreement or any other Basic
Document to which the Seller is a party.

 

(vi)

the Seller is a party, when duly executed and delivered by the
other parties hereto and thereto, shall constitute legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller
in accordance with their respective terms, except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

 

(vii)       
No Consents . The Seller is not required to obtain the
consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval,
registration, authorization, or declaration of or with any
governmental authority, bureau or agency in connection with the
execution, delivery, performance, validity, or enforceability of
this Agreement or any other Basic Document to which it is a party
that has not already been obtained, other than (A) UCC filings and
(B) consents, licenses, approvals, registrations, authorizations or
declarations which, if not obtained or made, would not have a
material adverse effect on the enforceability or collectibility of
the Receivables or would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Basic
Documents.

 

(viii)      
Ordinary Course . The transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which the Seller is a
party are in the ordinary course of the Seller’s

and marketable title to the Purchased Assets, free and clear of any

assignment of the Receivables to the Depositor, the subsequent
sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables by the Depositor
to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the
pledge of the Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.
