ADDvantage Overview




ADDvantage Technologies Group (through our subsidiaries) distribute and service a comprehensive line of electronics and hardware for the cable television (“CATV”) and telecommunications industries.  In addition, we also provide equipment repair services to cable operators.


 


Several of our subsidiaries, through their long relationships with the original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and specialty repair facilities, have established themselves as value-added resellers (“VARs”). ADDvantage has a reseller agreement with Arris Solutions to sell cable television equipment in the United States. We are also one of only three distributors of Arris broadband products. We are a distributor of Cisco video products as a Cisco Premier Partner, which allows us to sell Cisco’s IT related products. In addition, we are designated as an authorized third party Cisco repair center for select video products. Our subsidiaries also sell products from other OEMs including Alpha, Blonder-Tongue, RL Drake, Corning-Gilbert, Promax, Quintech, Standard and Triveni Digital.  


 


In addition to offering a broad range of new products, we also sell surplus-new and refurbished equipment that we purchase in the market as a result of cable operator system upgrades or an overstock in their warehouses. We maintain one of the industry's largest inventories of new and refurbished equipment, which allows us to expedite delivery of products to our customers. We continue to upgrade our new product offerings to stay in the forefront of the communications broadband technology revolution.


 


We also operate 7 technical service centers that service/repair most brands of CATV equipment.  In addition, we offer to our telecommunications customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we in turn process through our R2 certified recycling program.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
