A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Castleton – Fixed Income Portfolio Management + Consulting



























































 






 






Fixed Income Asset Management



 
 
 






Portfolio Consulting



 
 
 






Impact Investing



 
 
 


 


 



 

 
"We don't manage for performance. We manage risk... and learn to accept superior results." 

 
Castleton is a registered investment adviser providing customized, fixed income investment management and portfolio consulting through a fully transparent and client-centric business model. Our purpose is to be a valued partner in the pursuit of wealth preservation.

We combine decades of experience managing diverse fixed income portfolios for private clients with a pure bond and investment banking heritage. We use our expertise to design and construct innovative portfolios with the efficacy of a large institution, the agility of an independently owned practice and the creative insight of experienced market veterans. This represents an institutional-caliber capability that is seldom available to private investors. 

The majority of our clients are themselves accomplished financial professionals. We view this as confirmation that we have earned the trust and confidence of informed and experienced investors. However, it does not suggest an unwillingness to partner with clients outside of the industry. 

We are deliberate in partnering with clients who share and appreciate our values, our philosophy and our investing approach. 

When we enter into such a partnership, we are accepting the responsibility of protecting wealth. 
The gravity of that responsibility is never misplaced.

 
 





We invite you to learn more about Castleton.

Impact Investing
This strategy focuses on investments that provide measurable and positive social or environmental impact. This priority can—and often, does—co-exist with other investment goals.
Impact portfolios are built upon the Investment Grade Fixed Income strategy and can be applied as an overlay to any investment style within that strategy. Beyond enhanced credit selection, an Impact portfolio undergoes rigorous, independent, third party pre-investment screening coupled with post-investment analytics performed by a leading ESG reporting firm. These features enhance risk monitoring and mitigation, while providing transparency into a portfolio’s social and environmental impact.
Unique to this architecture are the support for objectivity in impact analysis and the ability to preserve and leverage each firms’ highly specialized expertise.
 Close


















Investment Grade Fixed Income
The primary investment objective of this strategy is to attain an income-focused rate of return with a prudent level of risk, achievable from a portfolio of publicly traded securities. These securities include, but are not limited to, fixed income securities, exchanged traded funds, preferred stock, and mutual funds. Clients may select from three styles.
CAPITAL PRESERVATION
This goal focuses on minimizing portfolio risk and providing a safe and reliable income stream. Liquidity and credit is considered more strongly than income.
STABLE INCOME
This goal focuses on principal protection but also aims to improve or stabilize income with liquid and diversified instruments. These securities may be of some credit or maturity risk.
INCOME OPPORTUNITY
This goal aims to accept a level of calculated risk to satisfy income. This investment style may include holdings that could be more speculative in terms of credit, maturity, or liquidity.
 Close


















Special Strategies
These strategies seek to capitalize on opportunities in distressed and other securities that Castleton believes to be undervalued by the marketplace. These opportunities seek potential capital gains, as well as income.
As a general rule, Special Strategies are identified, rather than actively sought. This typically occurs when a bond issuer comes under severe pressure, due to a number of market and financial developments. When these pressures create the potential for a significant rise in yield, Castleton carefully analyzes factors including liquidity, possible bankruptcy and risk of market access to assess the risk and value of the potential investment.
Special Strategies typically have a higher turnover rate than traditional strategies and are pursued when Castleton feels the price of securities justify the risk. The risks of any particular Special Strategy may not be suitable for all clients.

TRUST
We establish a foundation of trust with our clients by committing ourselves to the highest standard of ethics in all business and investment decisions. As a registered investment adviser, we remain ever mindful of our fiduciary responsibility.






DISCIPLINE
We are rigorous in protecting our clients’ wealth by utilizing proven models that produce repeatable results. We are patient and composed. We manage by logic, with a practical sensitivity to history and fundamentals.






RESPONSIBILITY
We embrace the fundamental belief that establishing a relationship with a client is not the same as acquiring a new customer. We accept the responsibility of protecting your wealth. We do so with genuine gravity. It is our purpose.






KNOWLEDGE
We utilize our pedigree and our well-established network of resources to grow knowledge. We make every effort to present our perspective, to acquire new knowledge, and to foster an ecosystem of intelligence sharing that enriches us all.






SERVICE
We afford clients direct access to our management team, to the markets and to our capabilities. We are responsive, cooperative, and professional in providing authentic, personalized service.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
