Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4
    





October 26, 2016 01:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings and Outlooks to the CarMax Auto Owner 
      Trust 2016-4 (CAOT 2016-4) notes as follows:
    

      --$243,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$427,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$428,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$130,500,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25,950,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,100,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,450,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2016-4 is in line with the prior six 
      transactions from a collateral credit quality perspective. The WA FICO 
      is 705, and the amount of loans with terms greater than 60 month loans 
      is consistent at 59.9%.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: CAOT 2016-4 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. The initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A and B is 
      lower than the last transaction rated by Fitch, while initial hard CE 
      for the class C is higher and D notes is unchanged compared to those in 
      the last transaction. The initial CE is sufficient to withstand Fitch's 
      base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 2.40% for all classes of 
      notes at each class' respective loss coverage multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CAF's portfolio 
      and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen 
      in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes CAF to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for 2016-4.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses that could 
      lead to potential downgrades of up to two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-4 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning

      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-2
    





April 20, 2016 12:55 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-2 (CAOT 2016-2) listed 
      below:
    

      --$230,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$194,000,000 class A-2A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$194,000,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$365,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$113,900,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,200,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,700,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,200,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2016-2 is slightly stronger than 2016-1, but 
      consistent overall compared to the prior five transactions from a 
      collateral credit quality perspective. The WA FICO is 704. However, 
      greater than 60 months loans (60.5% of this pool) are at the highest 
      level since 2013-4.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: CAOT 2016-2 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. The initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A is 
      unchanged from 2016-1 (not rated by Fitch) and higher than the last 
      Fitch-rated deal (2015-3), while CE for the class B and C notes has 
      declined. Initial CE for the class D notes remains unchanged. The 
      initial CE is sufficient to withstand Fitch's base case cumulative net 
      loss (CNL) proxy of 2.35% for all classes of notes at each class' 
      respective loss coverage multiple.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CAF's portfolio 
      and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen 
      in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes CAF to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for CAOT 2016-2.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-2 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they 
      could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. This third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A

      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2016-2 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as
