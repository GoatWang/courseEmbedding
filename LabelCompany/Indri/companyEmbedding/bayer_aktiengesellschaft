Flea bites can hurt your cat—and your cat’s health
Seeing a flea on your clean, well-cared for cat can be a horrifying experience. In addition to the major “ick” factor fleas bring, they can bite your cat, causing pain and leading to health issues.
Examine flea risks ›







Myth: Ticks don’t harm cats
You’ve probably heard of Lyme disease, which can affect dogs. Luckily, it doesn’t affect cats. But there are other diseases caused by ticks that can be deadly to cats. Learn about the risks and how to prevent ticks on cats.
Understand tick disease risk ›







Fleas aren’t just annoying – they can cause health issues
Fleas can be intensely irritating for your dog — and you — and not just in the “annoying” sense of the word. Even a few fleas can pose health risks for your dog.
Discover flea risks›







Tick disease: It only takes one bite
When a tick pierces your dog’s skin to feed on blood, it can transmit dangerous diseases like Lyme disease. Find out more about the threat ticks pose and how you can help prevent ticks on dogs.

Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

When fleas, ticks and mosquitoes bite your dog, they can cause irritation and transmit deadly diseases. But not all products work the same.K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks AND mosquitoes through contact. No biting required. Now that's a wise choice.

									No biting required.
								
Veterinarian-recommended K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice, and repels biting flies. And because it works through contact, there’s no biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.



Learn how fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can have a negative effect on the health of your dog, and much more.Can't seem to get rid of those fleas?Learn More >Tick disease: It only takes one bite. Learn More >Mosquitoes: A little insect that carries big health risks.Learn More >


















We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.

Product AreasProducts for the Health of Humans, Animals and Plants
Bayer’s broad product portfolio includes many world-famous brands which have shaped the iconic Bayer brand. With our products, we are contributing to finding solutions to some of the major challenges of our time. The growing and increasingly aging world population requires improved medical care and an adequate supply of food. Bayer is improving peo­ple’s quality of life by preventing, alleviating and curing diseases. And we are helping to provide a reliable supply of high-quality food, feed and plant-based raw materials.
Some of our products have been helping our customers for decades; others only recently came out of our labs. Their active ingredients are designed to influence the biochemical processes in living organisms. As different as people, animals and plants might seem, common rules govern the molecular mechanisms in all life forms. The active ingredients promote or enable positive processes or they prevent or suppress negative processes. That’s what Life Science is all about. And with our innovative products, we help to make life better.

Bayer AG: Products/Projects





 




Overview


Tue, 14/06/2005 - 00:00
Bayer AG
 
A Corporate Profile
By Corporate Watch UK
Completed March 2002
2. Products and Projects
2.1. Bayer Healthcare 2.2 Bayer CropScience 2.3 Bayer Chemicals 2.4 Bayer Polymers
 
What do the CD you are listening to, the mattress you sleep on, the clothes you wear, the hangover cure that sees you through the morning after the night before, the prescription drugs that the doctor gives you, the pesticides that are sprayed on fields near where you live (and are on the food you eat), the skin of that sausage you have just eaten…all have in common? There is a good chance that some if not all of these products are at least partially made by Bayer AG. Bayer are one of the most ubiquitous corporations going, you may not know it but their products are all around you (and inside you).
Bayer produce very few products that are recognised by the general public. Well known Bayer brands include Alka-Seltzer, One-A-Day vitamins and Baby-Bio. The following section is a division by division overview of Bayer's products.
2.1. Bayer Healthcare: [9]

 Bayer's healthcare division is divided into five further segments:
Pharmaceuticals [10]
Bayer's most famous product during the last few months has been Cipro, (www.cipro.com) a broad spectrum antibiotic which is used against anthrax. See the Corporate Crimes section for more information on how Bayer managed to overcharge the US and Canadian governments for Cipro and made a fortune out of the anthrax attacks.
Another flagship product is Avelox, (www.avelox.com) an antibiotic.
Bayer also manufactures Aspirin Protect in Germany
Bayer's products in the UK are:
· Adalat (nifedipine) (Cardiovascular)
· Ciproxin (ciprofloxacin) (Anti-Infective)
· Glucobay (acarbose) (Metabolics)
· Nimotop (nimodipine) (Central Nervous System)
· Trasylol (aprotinin) (Cardiovascular)
· DTIC-DOME (dacarbazine) (Oncology)
Biological Products [11]
The Biological Products division manufactures human therapeutic products, all except one of which are derived from human plasma.
Consumer Care [12]
Bayer Consumer Care makes over-the-counter drugs. Its best known products are Aspirin, Alka-Seltzer, One-A-Day, Antan, Baygon and Canesten.
Diagnostics [13]
Bayer Diagnostics has developed the following systems:
· ADVIA® systems (Immunology, haematology, clinical chemistry, laboratory automation)
· Clinitek® devices (Urine analysis in physicians' offices)
· Glucometer® (Blood glucose meters range for diabetics)
· N-Neostix® (Urine test strips for home use)

2.2. Bayer CropScience[15]
Bayer's CropScience business segment, including the Crop Protection business group, researches and develops new chemical crop protection agents to control diseases, pests and weeds in food crops. Such products include the fungicide Folicur®, the herbicides Goltix® and Sencor® and the insecticides Bulldock® and Baythroid®.[16]
Bayer has greatly expanded its crop protection business with the acquisition of Aventis CropScience (ACS) (link to ACS section below). The purchase agreement was signed in October 2001. The crop science activities will be organised as a separate legal entity named 'Bayer CropScience'. The business will cover all agrochemical activities as well as biotechnology and seeds.[17]

Back to top
Bayer and the Aventis CropScience purchase In early October 2001 Bayer AG finally acquired Aventis CropScience at a cost of 7.25bn Euro (£4.5bn)[22], their largest single purchase ever. In so doing Bayer CropScience, as its new agriculture division will be known, have become the second largest agro-chemical and seed company in the world behind Syngenta. They have also become the leading company pushing forward the commercialisation of GM crops in the UK and Europe, and arejust one of a few companies selling GM crops in the US, Canada and elsewhere in the world.
Aventis CropScience was formed in late 1999 by the merger of AgrEvo (itself a joint venture between the agricultural businesses of Hoechst and Schering) and the agricultural business of Rhone-Poulenc. At the time of the sale to Bayer, Aventis CropScience had a substantial portfolio of products including GM seeds (both herbicide tolerant and insect-resistant lines) and a range of agro-chemicals.[23] Its 2000 sales were worth 4,034 million Euros and it employed about 14,400 people in more than 120 countries worldwide.[24]
Having shed its loss-making CropScience business (it is also currently in the process of selling off its Animal Nutrition business[25]) Aventis is now concentrating on pharmaceuticals. It will, however, retain all future liability for damages claims made in relation to last year's (2000) Starlink GM contamination scandal.[26] Aventis have already launched a huge advertising campaign to try to re-brand themselves as the squeaky clean, benevolent drugs company that will save the world (see the CW subvert on the back cover of the December 2001 edition of The Ecologist).
Despite considerable existing holdings in crop protection, until now Bayer has kept its distance from GM crops, preferring a more 'traditional' reliance on agro-chemicals. Its acquisition of Aventis CropScience has vastly enhanced Bayer's agricultural sector, particularly in herbicides and conventional and GM seeds. Bayer now owns over half of the GM crop varieties currently seeking approval for commercial growing in the EU. These include 9 varieties of oilseed rape and one variety of maize, all of which are modified to be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium, or Liberty, also now owned by Bayer.[27] Should the de facto EU moratorium on the commercial growing of GM crops be lifted, Bayer will be best placed to flood European fields with GM crops. In the UK Bayer will be responsible for the majority of GM field trials, including the controversial farm scale trials, during 2002.
The new Bayer CropScience will form one of Bayer's new independent corporate units. At the time of writing (late January 2002) it is uncertain quite how the new company will look. The European Commission has launched an enquiry into the CropScience purchase claiming that competition may be significantly reduced in the areas of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and seed treatment products.[28] Bayer may be forced to sell off certain areas of CropScience. Prior to the acquisition, BASF had expressed an interest in buying some, or all, of Aventis' insecticide business.[29]
Although the composition of the management of the new company has recently been announced,[30] it remains to be seen quite how Bayer's existing agricultural concerns will be merged with Aventis CropScience, and what the implications will be for shedding of infrastructure and job losses.[31] Recent articles in the financial press suggest that the merging of the two agricultural businesses may result in 3, 000 job loses. [32] Likewise its strategy for expanding sales of GM crops is still unknown.
For more information on the company that was Aventis CropScience go to the Corporate Watch Aventis briefing at www.corporatewatch.org.uk/publications/GEBriefings/aventis1.html

2.3. Bayer Chemicals [33]
The business segment Chemicals at Bayer includes the divisions Basic and Fine Chemicals, Speciality Products, as well as the subsidiary companies Haarmann & Reimer, H.C. Starck and since the fiscal year 2000 Wolff Walsrode.
Bayer will divest Haarmann & Reimer as part of their reorganisation process. You can find more information on Bayer's reorganisation process and the aforementioned subsidiaries in the 'Who, Where, How much?' section [link] of this profile.
Basic and Fine Chemicals The production and marketing of basic and fine chemicals are among the core activities of the Bayer Group. The company is one of the world's leading suppliers of these products. Fine chemicals have a key role as precursors for pharmaceuticals, crop protection agents, plastics and electronic components.

Bayer facility in Leverkusen


Bayer AG (/ˈbeɪər/ or /ˈbaɪər/); German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ɐ]) is a German multinational chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences company. It is headquartered in Leverkusen, where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The company's motto is "science for a better life."
Bayer's first and best known product was aspirin; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, Arthur Eichengrün or Felix Hoffmann. Bayer trademarked the name "heroin" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital, prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Yaz (drospirenone) birth control pills. In 2014 Bayer bought MSD's consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops genetically modified crops and pesticides. Its materials science division makes polymers like polyurethanes and polycarbonate.
Bayer was founded in Barmen in 1863. It was part of IG Farben, the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder during the early Cold War and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired Schering in 2006 and announced its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Bayer AG was founded in Barmen (today a part of Wuppertal), Germany in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.[1]




Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen


The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.[5]:51 An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen, the location of Bayer AG's headquarters.[6]
Aspirin[edit]
Bayer's first major product was acetylsalicylic acid (originally discovered by French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1853), a modification of salicylic acid or salicin, a folk remedy found in the bark of the willow plant.[7][8] By 1899, Bayer's trademark Aspirin was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during World War I by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.[9] It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland. As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.[10] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[11]
There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. Arthur Eichengrün, a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an aspirin formulation which did not have the unpleasant side effects of nausea and gastric pain. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by Felix Hoffmann to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had arthritis. Various sources support the conflicting claims.[12][13] Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.[14][15]
Heroin[edit]




Bayer Heroin bottle


Heroin (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.[16] Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[17] Heroin was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.[18]
Phenobarbital[edit]
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of phenobarbital in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.[19][20]
Prior to World War II[edit]
As part of the reparations after World War I, Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.[1] In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by Sterling Drug, a predecessor of Sterling Winthrop. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business from SmithKline Beecham and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.[21]
In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered suramin, an anti-parasite drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team of the Pasteur Institute.[22]:378–379[23] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[24]
Bayer became part of IG Farben, a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925. In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists Gerhard Domagk, Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine.[25] Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1939.[26]
World War II[edit]
During World War II, IG Farben used slave labor in factories that it built adjacent to German concentration camps, notably Auschwitz,[27] and the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.[28] IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[29][30] IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."[31] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.[32]
After World War II, the Allies broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.[29] Fritz ter Meer, an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the IG Farben Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[33]
In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of Bayer Corporation, publicly apologized to Elie Wiesel for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in Pittsburgh.[34]
Post World War II[edit]





Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany


In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.[35]
In 1978, Bayer purchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and Cutter Laboratories, acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones vitamins and One-A-Day vitamins, and Cutter insect repellent.[36]
Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's Factor VIII business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat hemophilia, was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified contaminated blood products as a source of infection.[37] According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."[37] Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.[37] But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.[37]
In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a statin drug, Baycol (Cerivastatin) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.[38]
Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.
2000–2009[edit]
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of Roche Pharmaceuticals.[39]
In March 2008, Bayer HealthCare announced an agreement to acquire the portfolio and OTC division of privately owned Sagmel, Inc., a US-based company that markets OTC medications in most of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and others.[40][41] On 2 November 2010, Bayer AG signed an agreement to buy Auckland-based animal health company Bomac Group.[42]
Bayer partnered on the development of the radiotherapeutic Xofigo with Algeta, and in 2014 moved to acquire the company for about $2.9 billion.[43] In 2014, Bayer agreed to buy Merck's consumer health business for $14.2 billion which would provide Bayer control with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Bayer would attain second place globally in nonprescription drugs.[44] In June 2015, Bayer agreed to sell its diabetic care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for a fee of $1.02 billion.[45]
Acquisition of Schering[edit]
In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering AG, which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion[46] and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.[47] Bayer responded with a white knight bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,[48] and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,[47]:49–52[49] and as of 2015 this was one of the ten biggest pharma mergers of all time.[50]
2010 onwards[edit]
Spin off of Covestro[edit]
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called Covestro in which it retained about a 70% interest.[51][52] Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.[51] Covestro shares were first offered on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in October 2015.[53]
Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.[54]
Acquisition of Monsanto[edit]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto for $62 billion.[55] Shortly after Bayer's offer, Monsanto rejected the acquisition bid, seeking a higher price.[56] Bayer attempted to purchase Monsanto again for $66 billion in September 2016, Monsanto accepted this bid and the merger is pending approval.[57][58] As part of the takeover, Bayer agreed to sell both of its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink seeds businesses in order for the deal to pass South Africa's Competition Commission. The divisions being divested had sales worth an estimated $2.5 billion[59]

Corporate structure[edit]
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a holding company. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer AG. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; Bayer MaterialScience AG and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH & Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a life sciences based company.[77] By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.[78][79]

Bayer CropScience[edit]
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. pesticides), nonagricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in genetic engineering of food.[80] In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of Sanofi) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company Plant Genetic Systems became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.[80] Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.[81][82]:270 In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.[83] In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States between 2013 and 2016. A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty. Liberty is used to kill weeds which have grown resistant to Monsanto's product Roundup. [84] In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, Liam Condon.[85]
Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian stock exchanges viz. the Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock Exchange of India and has a market capitalization of $2 billion.[86] Bayer BioScience, headquartered in Hyderabad, India has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across India.[87][88]
Bayer Consumer Health[edit]
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.[80] As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough & Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.[89]
Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements Redoxon and Berocca, and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.[80] Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin. Both pills use a newer type of progesterone hormone called drospirenone in combination with estrogen. Yaz is advertised as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and moderate acne. Other key products include the cancer drug Nexavar, the multiple sclerosis drug betaferon/betaseron and the blood-clotting drug, Kogenate.[80] In May 2014 it was announced that Bayer would buy Merck & Co's consumer health care unit for $14.2 billion.[90] Bayer also controls Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd in China.[91]
Bayer Pharmaceuticals[edit]
The Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s healthcare and cardiology, and also on specialty therapeutics in the areas of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. The division also comprises the Radiology Business Unit which markets contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents.[92]
In addition to internal R&D, Bayer has participated in public–private partnerships. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox program.[93][94] another is the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[95]
Bayer Animal Health[edit]
Bayer HealthCare's Animal Health Division is the maker of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution for dogs and cats, Advantage flea control for cats and dogs and K9 Advantix, a flea, tick, and mosquito control product for dogs. Advantage Multi, K9 Advantix and Advantage are trademarks of Bayer. The division specializes in parasite control and prescription pharmaceuticals for dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. North American operation for the Animal Health Division are headquartered in Shawnee, Kansas. Bayer Animal Health is a division of Bayer HealthCare LLC.[96]
Bayer Business Services[edit]
Bayer Business Services located at the Bayer USA Headquarters in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Bayer Business Services handles the information technology infrastructure and technical support aspect of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. This is also the headquarters of the North American Service Desk, the central IT Help Desk for all of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. Bayer Business Services also employs 4500 specialists in India.[97] Bayer Technology Services is engaged in process development and in process and plant engineering, construction and optimization.[80] Currenta offers services for the chemical industry, including utility supply, waste management, infrastructure, safety, security, analytics and vocational training[80] and is a joint venture between Bayer and Lanxess.[98]
Defunct business units[edit]
Bayer Chemicals AG (with the exception of H.C. Starck and Wolff Walsrode) was combined with certain components of the polymers segment to form the new company Lanxess on 1 July 2004. Lanxess was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in early 2005.[99]
Bayer HealthCare's Diagnostics Division was acquired by Siemens Medical Solutions in January 2007.[100]
Bayer Diabetes Care manages Bayer's medical devices portfolio. Key products include the blood glucose monitors Contour Next EZ (XT), Contour, Contour USB and Breeze 2 used in the management of diabetes.[80] The diabetes business unit was sold to Panasonic Healthcare Co. for $1.15 billion in June 2015[101]
Bayer MaterialScience was a supplier of high-tech polymers, and developed solutions for a broad range of applications relevant to everyday life.[80] On 18 September 2014, the Board of Directors of Bayer AG announced plans to float the Bayer MaterialScience business on the stock market as a separate entity.[102] On 1 June 2015 Bayer announced that the new company would be named Covestro[103] and Bayer formally spun out Covestro in September 2015.[51]
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Pharmaceutical[edit]
In 2014 pharmaceutical products contributed €12.05 billion of Bayer's €40.15 billion in gross revenue.[104] Top-selling products included

Kogenate (recombinant clotting factor VIII). Kogenate is a recombinant version of clotting factor VIII,[105] the absence of deficiency of which causes the abnormal bleeding associated with haemophilia type A. Kogenate is one of several commercially available Factor VIII products having equivalent efficacy.[106]
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a small molecule inhibitor of Factor Xa, a key enzyme involved in blood coagulation. In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.[107] Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as apixaban and dabigatran as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin. It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.[108]
Betaseron is an injectable form of the protein interferon beta used to prevent relapses in the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis.[109] Betaseron competes with other injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and a variety of newer multiple sclerosis drugs, some of which can be taken orally (Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, others).
Yasmin / Yaz birth control pills are part of a group of birth control pill products based on the synthetic progesterone analog drospirenone. Yaz is approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy, to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception, and to treat moderate acne in women at least 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. The FDA has conducted a safety review regarding the potential of Yaz and other drospirenone-containing products to increase the risk of blood clots. Although conflicting results were obtained in different studies, the Agency added a warning to the label that Yaz and related products may be associated with an increased risk of clotting relative to other birth control pill products.[110] Subsequently, a meta analysis suggested that birth control pills of the class Yasmin belongs to raise the risk of blood clots to a greater extent than some other classes of birth control pills.[111]
Nexavar (sorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), and certain types of thyroid cancer.[112]
Trasylol (Aprotinin) Trasylol is a trypsin inhibitor used to control bleeding during major surgery. In a 2006 meeting called by the FDA to review the drug's safety, Bayer scientists failed to reveal the results of an ongoing large study suggesting that Trasylol may increase the risks of death and stroke. According to a FDA official who preferred to remain anonymous, the FDA learned of the study only through information provided to the FDA by a whistleblowing scientist who was involved in it.[113][114] The study concluded Trasylol carried greater risks of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. On 15 December of the same year the FDA restricted the use of Trasylol,[115] and in November 2007 they requested that the company suspend marketing.[116] In 2011, Health Canada lifted its suspension of Trasylol for its originally approved indication of limiting bleeding in coronary bypass surgery, citing flaws in the design of the studies that led to its suspension.[117] This decision was controversial.[118][119] In 2013 the European Medicines Agency lifted its suspension of the Trasylol marketing authorization for selected patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, citing a favorable risk-benefit ratio.[120]
Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Ciprofloxacin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[121][122] In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US.[123]
Rennie antacid tablets, one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £29.8 million.[124]

Agricultural[edit]
Bayer produces various fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and some crop varieties.[125]

Fungicides are primarily marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, and control of mildew and rust diseases.[126] Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin tebuconazole.[127][128] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole,[129] while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.[130]
Herbicides are marketed primarily for field crops and orchards.[131] Liberty brands containing glufosinate are used for general weed control.[132] Capreno containing a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl and tembotrione is used for grass and broad-leaf control.[133]
Insecticides are marketed according to specific crop and insect pest type.[134] Foliar insecticides include Belt containing flubendiamide, which is marketed against Lepidopteran pests,[135] and Movento containing spirotetramat, which is marketed against sucking insects.[136] Neonicotinoids such clothianidin and imidacloprid are used as systemic seed treatments products such as Poncho and Goucho.[137][138] In 2008 neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impacts starting in Germany. Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[139][140][141] Parathion was discovered by scientists at IG Farben in the 1940s as an cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide. Its use is banned in most developed countries.[142] Propoxur is a carbamate insecticide that was introduced by Bayer in 1959.[143]

Bayer 04 Leverkusen[edit]
Main article: Bayer 04 Leverkusen
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now KFC Uerdingen 05).[144]
Chemical accident[edit]
On 28 August 2008, an explosion occurred at the Bayer CropScience facility at Institute, West Virginia, United States. A runaway reaction ruptured a tank and the resulting explosion killed two employees.[145] The ruptured tank was close to a methyl isocyanate tank which was undamaged by the explosion.[146]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In October 2008, Bayer's Canadian division was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The Canadian division was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star newspaper.[147] Bayer USA was given a score of 85 (out of 100) in the Human Rights Campaign's 2011 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of gay and lesbian workplace equality.[148]
In 2016, Standard Ethics Aei has given a rating to Bayer in order to include the company in its Standard Ethics German Index. Bayer has received an EE- rating, which is the fourth tier in an eight tier ranking.[149]

Bayer facility in Leverkusen


Bayer AG (/ˈbeɪər/ or /ˈbaɪər/); German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ɐ]) is a German multinational chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences company. It is headquartered in Leverkusen, where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The company's motto is "science for a better life."
Bayer's first and best known product was aspirin; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, Arthur Eichengrün or Felix Hoffmann. Bayer trademarked the name "heroin" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital, prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Yaz (drospirenone) birth control pills. In 2014 Bayer bought MSD's consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops genetically modified crops and pesticides. Its materials science division makes polymers like polyurethanes and polycarbonate.
Bayer was founded in Barmen in 1863. It was part of IG Farben, the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder during the early Cold War and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired Schering in 2006 and announced its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Bayer AG was founded in Barmen (today a part of Wuppertal), Germany in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.[1]




Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen


The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.[5]:51 An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen, the location of Bayer AG's headquarters.[6]
Aspirin[edit]
Bayer's first major product was acetylsalicylic acid (originally discovered by French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1853), a modification of salicylic acid or salicin, a folk remedy found in the bark of the willow plant.[7][8] By 1899, Bayer's trademark Aspirin was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during World War I by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.[9] It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland. As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.[10] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[11]
There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. Arthur Eichengrün, a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an aspirin formulation which did not have the unpleasant side effects of nausea and gastric pain. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by Felix Hoffmann to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had arthritis. Various sources support the conflicting claims.[12][13] Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.[14][15]
Heroin[edit]




Bayer Heroin bottle


Heroin (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.[16] Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[17] Heroin was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.[18]
Phenobarbital[edit]
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of phenobarbital in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.[19][20]
Prior to World War II[edit]
As part of the reparations after World War I, Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.[1] In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by Sterling Drug, a predecessor of Sterling Winthrop. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business from SmithKline Beecham and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.[21]
In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered suramin, an anti-parasite drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team of the Pasteur Institute.[22]:378–379[23] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[24]
Bayer became part of IG Farben, a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925. In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists Gerhard Domagk, Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine.[25] Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1939.[26]
World War II[edit]
During World War II, IG Farben used slave labor in factories that it built adjacent to German concentration camps, notably Auschwitz,[27] and the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.[28] IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[29][30] IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."[31] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.[32]
After World War II, the Allies broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.[29] Fritz ter Meer, an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the IG Farben Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[33]
In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of Bayer Corporation, publicly apologized to Elie Wiesel for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in Pittsburgh.[34]
Post World War II[edit]





Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany


In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.[35]
In 1978, Bayer purchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and Cutter Laboratories, acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones vitamins and One-A-Day vitamins, and Cutter insect repellent.[36]
Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's Factor VIII business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat hemophilia, was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified contaminated blood products as a source of infection.[37] According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."[37] Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.[37] But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.[37]
In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a statin drug, Baycol (Cerivastatin) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.[38]
Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.
2000–2009[edit]
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of Roche Pharmaceuticals.[39]
In March 2008, Bayer HealthCare announced an agreement to acquire the portfolio and OTC division of privately owned Sagmel, Inc., a US-based company that markets OTC medications in most of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and others.[40][41] On 2 November 2010, Bayer AG signed an agreement to buy Auckland-based animal health company Bomac Group.[42]
Bayer partnered on the development of the radiotherapeutic Xofigo with Algeta, and in 2014 moved to acquire the company for about $2.9 billion.[43] In 2014, Bayer agreed to buy Merck's consumer health business for $14.2 billion which would provide Bayer control with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Bayer would attain second place globally in nonprescription drugs.[44] In June 2015, Bayer agreed to sell its diabetic care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for a fee of $1.02 billion.[45]
Acquisition of Schering[edit]
In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering AG, which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion[46] and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.[47] Bayer responded with a white knight bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,[48] and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,[47]:49–52[49] and as of 2015 this was one of the ten biggest pharma mergers of all time.[50]
2010 onwards[edit]
Spin off of Covestro[edit]
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called Covestro in which it retained about a 70% interest.[51][52] Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.[51] Covestro shares were first offered on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in October 2015.[53]
Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.[54]
Acquisition of Monsanto[edit]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto for $62 billion.[55] Shortly after Bayer's offer, Monsanto rejected the acquisition bid, seeking a higher price.[56] Bayer attempted to purchase Monsanto again for $66 billion in September 2016, Monsanto accepted this bid and the merger is pending approval.[57][58] As part of the takeover, Bayer agreed to sell both of its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink seeds businesses in order for the deal to pass South Africa's Competition Commission. The divisions being divested had sales worth an estimated $2.5 billion[59]

Corporate structure[edit]
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a holding company. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer AG. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; Bayer MaterialScience AG and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH & Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a life sciences based company.[77] By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.[78][79]

Bayer CropScience[edit]
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. pesticides), nonagricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in genetic engineering of food.[80] In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of Sanofi) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company Plant Genetic Systems became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.[80] Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.[81][82]:270 In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.[83] In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States between 2013 and 2016. A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty. Liberty is used to kill weeds which have grown resistant to Monsanto's product Roundup. [84] In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, Liam Condon.[85]
Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian stock exchanges viz. the Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock Exchange of India and has a market capitalization of $2 billion.[86] Bayer BioScience, headquartered in Hyderabad, India has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across India.[87][88]
Bayer Consumer Health[edit]
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.[80] As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough & Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.[89]
Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements Redoxon and Berocca, and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.[80] Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin. Both pills use a newer type of progesterone hormone called drospirenone in combination with estrogen. Yaz is advertised as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and moderate acne. Other key products include the cancer drug Nexavar, the multiple sclerosis drug betaferon/betaseron and the blood-clotting drug, Kogenate.[80] In May 2014 it was announced that Bayer would buy Merck & Co's consumer health care unit for $14.2 billion.[90] Bayer also controls Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd in China.[91]
Bayer Pharmaceuticals[edit]
The Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s healthcare and cardiology, and also on specialty therapeutics in the areas of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. The division also comprises the Radiology Business Unit which markets contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents.[92]
In addition to internal R&D, Bayer has participated in public–private partnerships. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox program.[93][94] another is the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[95]
Bayer Animal Health[edit]
Bayer HealthCare's Animal Health Division is the maker of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution for dogs and cats, Advantage flea control for cats and dogs and K9 Advantix, a flea, tick, and mosquito control product for dogs. Advantage Multi, K9 Advantix and Advantage are trademarks of Bayer. The division specializes in parasite control and prescription pharmaceuticals for dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. North American operation for the Animal Health Division are headquartered in Shawnee, Kansas. Bayer Animal Health is a division of Bayer HealthCare LLC.[96]
Bayer Business Services[edit]
Bayer Business Services located at the Bayer USA Headquarters in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Bayer Business Services handles the information technology infrastructure and technical support aspect of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. This is also the headquarters of the North American Service Desk, the central IT Help Desk for all of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. Bayer Business Services also employs 4500 specialists in India.[97] Bayer Technology Services is engaged in process development and in process and plant engineering, construction and optimization.[80] Currenta offers services for the chemical industry, including utility supply, waste management, infrastructure, safety, security, analytics and vocational training[80] and is a joint venture between Bayer and Lanxess.[98]
Defunct business units[edit]
Bayer Chemicals AG (with the exception of H.C. Starck and Wolff Walsrode) was combined with certain components of the polymers segment to form the new company Lanxess on 1 July 2004. Lanxess was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in early 2005.[99]
Bayer HealthCare's Diagnostics Division was acquired by Siemens Medical Solutions in January 2007.[100]
Bayer Diabetes Care manages Bayer's medical devices portfolio. Key products include the blood glucose monitors Contour Next EZ (XT), Contour, Contour USB and Breeze 2 used in the management of diabetes.[80] The diabetes business unit was sold to Panasonic Healthcare Co. for $1.15 billion in June 2015[101]
Bayer MaterialScience was a supplier of high-tech polymers, and developed solutions for a broad range of applications relevant to everyday life.[80] On 18 September 2014, the Board of Directors of Bayer AG announced plans to float the Bayer MaterialScience business on the stock market as a separate entity.[102] On 1 June 2015 Bayer announced that the new company would be named Covestro[103] and Bayer formally spun out Covestro in September 2015.[51]
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Pharmaceutical[edit]
In 2014 pharmaceutical products contributed €12.05 billion of Bayer's €40.15 billion in gross revenue.[104] Top-selling products included

Kogenate (recombinant clotting factor VIII). Kogenate is a recombinant version of clotting factor VIII,[105] the absence of deficiency of which causes the abnormal bleeding associated with haemophilia type A. Kogenate is one of several commercially available Factor VIII products having equivalent efficacy.[106]
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a small molecule inhibitor of Factor Xa, a key enzyme involved in blood coagulation. In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.[107] Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as apixaban and dabigatran as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin. It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.[108]
Betaseron is an injectable form of the protein interferon beta used to prevent relapses in the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis.[109] Betaseron competes with other injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and a variety of newer multiple sclerosis drugs, some of which can be taken orally (Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, others).
Yasmin / Yaz birth control pills are part of a group of birth control pill products based on the synthetic progesterone analog drospirenone. Yaz is approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy, to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception, and to treat moderate acne in women at least 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. The FDA has conducted a safety review regarding the potential of Yaz and other drospirenone-containing products to increase the risk of blood clots. Although conflicting results were obtained in different studies, the Agency added a warning to the label that Yaz and related products may be associated with an increased risk of clotting relative to other birth control pill products.[110] Subsequently, a meta analysis suggested that birth control pills of the class Yasmin belongs to raise the risk of blood clots to a greater extent than some other classes of birth control pills.[111]
Nexavar (sorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), and certain types of thyroid cancer.[112]
Trasylol (Aprotinin) Trasylol is a trypsin inhibitor used to control bleeding during major surgery. In a 2006 meeting called by the FDA to review the drug's safety, Bayer scientists failed to reveal the results of an ongoing large study suggesting that Trasylol may increase the risks of death and stroke. According to a FDA official who preferred to remain anonymous, the FDA learned of the study only through information provided to the FDA by a whistleblowing scientist who was involved in it.[113][114] The study concluded Trasylol carried greater risks of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. On 15 December of the same year the FDA restricted the use of Trasylol,[115] and in November 2007 they requested that the company suspend marketing.[116] In 2011, Health Canada lifted its suspension of Trasylol for its originally approved indication of limiting bleeding in coronary bypass surgery, citing flaws in the design of the studies that led to its suspension.[117] This decision was controversial.[118][119] In 2013 the European Medicines Agency lifted its suspension of the Trasylol marketing authorization for selected patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, citing a favorable risk-benefit ratio.[120]
Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Ciprofloxacin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[121][122] In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US.[123]
Rennie antacid tablets, one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £29.8 million.[124]

Agricultural[edit]
Bayer produces various fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and some crop varieties.[125]

Fungicides are primarily marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, and control of mildew and rust diseases.[126] Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin tebuconazole.[127][128] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole,[129] while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.[130]
Herbicides are marketed primarily for field crops and orchards.[131] Liberty brands containing glufosinate are used for general weed control.[132] Capreno containing a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl and tembotrione is used for grass and broad-leaf control.[133]
Insecticides are marketed according to specific crop and insect pest type.[134] Foliar insecticides include Belt containing flubendiamide, which is marketed against Lepidopteran pests,[135] and Movento containing spirotetramat, which is marketed against sucking insects.[136] Neonicotinoids such clothianidin and imidacloprid are used as systemic seed treatments products such as Poncho and Goucho.[137][138] In 2008 neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impacts starting in Germany. Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[139][140][141] Parathion was discovered by scientists at IG Farben in the 1940s as an cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide. Its use is banned in most developed countries.[142] Propoxur is a carbamate insecticide that was introduced by Bayer in 1959.[143]

Bayer 04 Leverkusen[edit]
Main article: Bayer 04 Leverkusen
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now KFC Uerdingen 05).[144]
Chemical accident[edit]
On 28 August 2008, an explosion occurred at the Bayer CropScience facility at Institute, West Virginia, United States. A runaway reaction ruptured a tank and the resulting explosion killed two employees.[145] The ruptured tank was close to a methyl isocyanate tank which was undamaged by the explosion.[146]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In October 2008, Bayer's Canadian division was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The Canadian division was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star newspaper.[147] Bayer USA was given a score of 85 (out of 100) in the Human Rights Campaign's 2011 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of gay and lesbian workplace equality.[148]
In 2016, Standard Ethics Aei has given a rating to Bayer in order to include the company in its Standard Ethics German Index. Bayer has received an EE- rating, which is the fourth tier in an eight tier ranking.[149]

Bayer facility in Leverkusen


Bayer AG (/ˈbeɪər/ or /ˈbaɪər/); German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ɐ]) is a German multinational chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences company. It is headquartered in Leverkusen, where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The company's motto is "science for a better life."
Bayer's first and best known product was aspirin; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, Arthur Eichengrün or Felix Hoffmann. Bayer trademarked the name "heroin" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital, prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Yaz (drospirenone) birth control pills. In 2014 Bayer bought MSD's consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops genetically modified crops and pesticides. Its materials science division makes polymers like polyurethanes and polycarbonate.
Bayer was founded in Barmen in 1863. It was part of IG Farben, the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder during the early Cold War and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired Schering in 2006 and announced its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Bayer AG was founded in Barmen (today a part of Wuppertal), Germany in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.[1]




Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen


The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.[5]:51 An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen, the location of Bayer AG's headquarters.[6]
Aspirin[edit]
Bayer's first major product was acetylsalicylic acid (originally discovered by French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1853), a modification of salicylic acid or salicin, a folk remedy found in the bark of the willow plant.[7][8] By 1899, Bayer's trademark Aspirin was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during World War I by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.[9] It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland. As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.[10] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[11]
There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. Arthur Eichengrün, a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an aspirin formulation which did not have the unpleasant side effects of nausea and gastric pain. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by Felix Hoffmann to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had arthritis. Various sources support the conflicting claims.[12][13] Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.[14][15]
Heroin[edit]




Bayer Heroin bottle


Heroin (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.[16] Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[17] Heroin was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.[18]
Phenobarbital[edit]
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of phenobarbital in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.[19][20]
Prior to World War II[edit]
As part of the reparations after World War I, Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.[1] In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by Sterling Drug, a predecessor of Sterling Winthrop. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business from SmithKline Beecham and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.[21]
In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered suramin, an anti-parasite drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team of the Pasteur Institute.[22]:378–379[23] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[24]
Bayer became part of IG Farben, a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925. In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists Gerhard Domagk, Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine.[25] Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1939.[26]
World War II[edit]
During World War II, IG Farben used slave labor in factories that it built adjacent to German concentration camps, notably Auschwitz,[27] and the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.[28] IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[29][30] IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."[31] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.[32]
After World War II, the Allies broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.[29] Fritz ter Meer, an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the IG Farben Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[33]
In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of Bayer Corporation, publicly apologized to Elie Wiesel for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in Pittsburgh.[34]
Post World War II[edit]





Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany


In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.[35]
In 1978, Bayer purchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and Cutter Laboratories, acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones vitamins and One-A-Day vitamins, and Cutter insect repellent.[36]
Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's Factor VIII business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat hemophilia, was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified contaminated blood products as a source of infection.[37] According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."[37] Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.[37] But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.[37]
In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a statin drug, Baycol (Cerivastatin) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.[38]
Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.
2000–2009[edit]
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of Roche Pharmaceuticals.[39]
In March 2008, Bayer HealthCare announced an agreement to acquire the portfolio and OTC division of privately owned Sagmel, Inc., a US-based company that markets OTC medications in most of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and others.[40][41] On 2 November 2010, Bayer AG signed an agreement to buy Auckland-based animal health company Bomac Group.[42]
Bayer partnered on the development of the radiotherapeutic Xofigo with Algeta, and in 2014 moved to acquire the company for about $2.9 billion.[43] In 2014, Bayer agreed to buy Merck's consumer health business for $14.2 billion which would provide Bayer control with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Bayer would attain second place globally in nonprescription drugs.[44] In June 2015, Bayer agreed to sell its diabetic care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for a fee of $1.02 billion.[45]
Acquisition of Schering[edit]
In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering AG, which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion[46] and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.[47] Bayer responded with a white knight bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,[48] and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,[47]:49–52[49] and as of 2015 this was one of the ten biggest pharma mergers of all time.[50]
2010 onwards[edit]
Spin off of Covestro[edit]
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called Covestro in which it retained about a 70% interest.[51][52] Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.[51] Covestro shares were first offered on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in October 2015.[53]
Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.[54]
Acquisition of Monsanto[edit]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto for $62 billion.[55] Shortly after Bayer's offer, Monsanto rejected the acquisition bid, seeking a higher price.[56] Bayer attempted to purchase Monsanto again for $66 billion in September 2016, Monsanto accepted this bid and the merger is pending approval.[57][58] As part of the takeover, Bayer agreed to sell both of its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink seeds businesses in order for the deal to pass South Africa's Competition Commission. The divisions being divested had sales worth an estimated $2.5 billion[59]

Corporate structure[edit]
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a holding company. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer AG. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; Bayer MaterialScience AG and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH & Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a life sciences based company.[77] By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.[78][79]

Bayer CropScience[edit]
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. pesticides), nonagricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in genetic engineering of food.[80] In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of Sanofi) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company Plant Genetic Systems became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.[80] Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.[81][82]:270 In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.[83] In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States between 2013 and 2016. A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty. Liberty is used to kill weeds which have grown resistant to Monsanto's product Roundup. [84] In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, Liam Condon.[85]
Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian stock exchanges viz. the Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock Exchange of India and has a market capitalization of $2 billion.[86] Bayer BioScience, headquartered in Hyderabad, India has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across India.[87][88]
Bayer Consumer Health[edit]
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.[80] As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough & Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.[89]
Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements Redoxon and Berocca, and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.[80] Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin. Both pills use a newer type of progesterone hormone called drospirenone in combination with estrogen. Yaz is advertised as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and moderate acne. Other key products include the cancer drug Nexavar, the multiple sclerosis drug betaferon/betaseron and the blood-clotting drug, Kogenate.[80] In May 2014 it was announced that Bayer would buy Merck & Co's consumer health care unit for $14.2 billion.[90] Bayer also controls Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd in China.[91]
Bayer Pharmaceuticals[edit]
The Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s healthcare and cardiology, and also on specialty therapeutics in the areas of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. The division also comprises the Radiology Business Unit which markets contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents.[92]
In addition to internal R&D, Bayer has participated in public–private partnerships. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox program.[93][94] another is the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[95]
Bayer Animal Health[edit]
Bayer HealthCare's Animal Health Division is the maker of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution for dogs and cats, Advantage flea control for cats and dogs and K9 Advantix, a flea, tick, and mosquito control product for dogs. Advantage Multi, K9 Advantix and Advantage are trademarks of Bayer. The division specializes in parasite control and prescription pharmaceuticals for dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. North American operation for the Animal Health Division are headquartered in Shawnee, Kansas. Bayer Animal Health is a division of Bayer HealthCare LLC.[96]
Bayer Business Services[edit]
Bayer Business Services located at the Bayer USA Headquarters in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Bayer Business Services handles the information technology infrastructure and technical support aspect of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. This is also the headquarters of the North American Service Desk, the central IT Help Desk for all of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. Bayer Business Services also employs 4500 specialists in India.[97] Bayer Technology Services is engaged in process development and in process and plant engineering, construction and optimization.[80] Currenta offers services for the chemical industry, including utility supply, waste management, infrastructure, safety, security, analytics and vocational training[80] and is a joint venture between Bayer and Lanxess.[98]
Defunct business units[edit]
Bayer Chemicals AG (with the exception of H.C. Starck and Wolff Walsrode) was combined with certain components of the polymers segment to form the new company Lanxess on 1 July 2004. Lanxess was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in early 2005.[99]
Bayer HealthCare's Diagnostics Division was acquired by Siemens Medical Solutions in January 2007.[100]
Bayer Diabetes Care manages Bayer's medical devices portfolio. Key products include the blood glucose monitors Contour Next EZ (XT), Contour, Contour USB and Breeze 2 used in the management of diabetes.[80] The diabetes business unit was sold to Panasonic Healthcare Co. for $1.15 billion in June 2015[101]
Bayer MaterialScience was a supplier of high-tech polymers, and developed solutions for a broad range of applications relevant to everyday life.[80] On 18 September 2014, the Board of Directors of Bayer AG announced plans to float the Bayer MaterialScience business on the stock market as a separate entity.[102] On 1 June 2015 Bayer announced that the new company would be named Covestro[103] and Bayer formally spun out Covestro in September 2015.[51]
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Pharmaceutical[edit]
In 2014 pharmaceutical products contributed €12.05 billion of Bayer's €40.15 billion in gross revenue.[104] Top-selling products included

Kogenate (recombinant clotting factor VIII). Kogenate is a recombinant version of clotting factor VIII,[105] the absence of deficiency of which causes the abnormal bleeding associated with haemophilia type A. Kogenate is one of several commercially available Factor VIII products having equivalent efficacy.[106]
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a small molecule inhibitor of Factor Xa, a key enzyme involved in blood coagulation. In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.[107] Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as apixaban and dabigatran as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin. It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.[108]
Betaseron is an injectable form of the protein interferon beta used to prevent relapses in the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis.[109] Betaseron competes with other injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and a variety of newer multiple sclerosis drugs, some of which can be taken orally (Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, others).
Yasmin / Yaz birth control pills are part of a group of birth control pill products based on the synthetic progesterone analog drospirenone. Yaz is approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy, to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception, and to treat moderate acne in women at least 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. The FDA has conducted a safety review regarding the potential of Yaz and other drospirenone-containing products to increase the risk of blood clots. Although conflicting results were obtained in different studies, the Agency added a warning to the label that Yaz and related products may be associated with an increased risk of clotting relative to other birth control pill products.[110] Subsequently, a meta analysis suggested that birth control pills of the class Yasmin belongs to raise the risk of blood clots to a greater extent than some other classes of birth control pills.[111]
Nexavar (sorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), and certain types of thyroid cancer.[112]
Trasylol (Aprotinin) Trasylol is a trypsin inhibitor used to control bleeding during major surgery. In a 2006 meeting called by the FDA to review the drug's safety, Bayer scientists failed to reveal the results of an ongoing large study suggesting that Trasylol may increase the risks of death and stroke. According to a FDA official who preferred to remain anonymous, the FDA learned of the study only through information provided to the FDA by a whistleblowing scientist who was involved in it.[113][114] The study concluded Trasylol carried greater risks of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. On 15 December of the same year the FDA restricted the use of Trasylol,[115] and in November 2007 they requested that the company suspend marketing.[116] In 2011, Health Canada lifted its suspension of Trasylol for its originally approved indication of limiting bleeding in coronary bypass surgery, citing flaws in the design of the studies that led to its suspension.[117] This decision was controversial.[118][119] In 2013 the European Medicines Agency lifted its suspension of the Trasylol marketing authorization for selected patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, citing a favorable risk-benefit ratio.[120]
Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Ciprofloxacin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[121][122] In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US.[123]
Rennie antacid tablets, one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £29.8 million.[124]

Agricultural[edit]
Bayer produces various fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and some crop varieties.[125]

Fungicides are primarily marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, and control of mildew and rust diseases.[126] Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin tebuconazole.[127][128] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole,[129] while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.[130]
Herbicides are marketed primarily for field crops and orchards.[131] Liberty brands containing glufosinate are used for general weed control.[132] Capreno containing a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl and tembotrione is used for grass and broad-leaf control.[133]
Insecticides are marketed according to specific crop and insect pest type.[134] Foliar insecticides include Belt containing flubendiamide, which is marketed against Lepidopteran pests,[135] and Movento containing spirotetramat, which is marketed against sucking insects.[136] Neonicotinoids such clothianidin and imidacloprid are used as systemic seed treatments products such as Poncho and Goucho.[137][138] In 2008 neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impacts starting in Germany. Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[139][140][141] Parathion was discovered by scientists at IG Farben in the 1940s as an cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide. Its use is banned in most developed countries.[142] Propoxur is a carbamate insecticide that was introduced by Bayer in 1959.[143]

Bayer 04 Leverkusen[edit]
Main article: Bayer 04 Leverkusen
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now KFC Uerdingen 05).[144]
Chemical accident[edit]
On 28 August 2008, an explosion occurred at the Bayer CropScience facility at Institute, West Virginia, United States. A runaway reaction ruptured a tank and the resulting explosion killed two employees.[145] The ruptured tank was close to a methyl isocyanate tank which was undamaged by the explosion.[146]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In October 2008, Bayer's Canadian division was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The Canadian division was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star newspaper.[147] Bayer USA was given a score of 85 (out of 100) in the Human Rights Campaign's 2011 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of gay and lesbian workplace equality.[148]
In 2016, Standard Ethics Aei has given a rating to Bayer in order to include the company in its Standard Ethics German Index. Bayer has received an EE- rating, which is the fourth tier in an eight tier ranking.[149]

Bayer facility in Leverkusen


Bayer AG (/ˈbeɪər/ or /ˈbaɪər/); German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ɐ]) is a German multinational chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences company. It is headquartered in Leverkusen, where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The company's motto is "science for a better life."
Bayer's first and best known product was aspirin; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, Arthur Eichengrün or Felix Hoffmann. Bayer trademarked the name "heroin" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital, prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Yaz (drospirenone) birth control pills. In 2014 Bayer bought MSD's consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops genetically modified crops and pesticides. Its materials science division makes polymers like polyurethanes and polycarbonate.
Bayer was founded in Barmen in 1863. It was part of IG Farben, the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder during the early Cold War and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired Schering in 2006 and announced its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Bayer AG was founded in Barmen (today a part of Wuppertal), Germany in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.[1]




Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen


The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.[5]:51 An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen, the location of Bayer AG's headquarters.[6]
Aspirin[edit]
Bayer's first major product was acetylsalicylic acid (originally discovered by French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1853), a modification of salicylic acid or salicin, a folk remedy found in the bark of the willow plant.[7][8] By 1899, Bayer's trademark Aspirin was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during World War I by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.[9] It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland. As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.[10] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[11]
There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. Arthur Eichengrün, a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an aspirin formulation which did not have the unpleasant side effects of nausea and gastric pain. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by Felix Hoffmann to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had arthritis. Various sources support the conflicting claims.[12][13] Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.[14][15]
Heroin[edit]




Bayer Heroin bottle


Heroin (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.[16] Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[17] Heroin was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.[18]
Phenobarbital[edit]
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of phenobarbital in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.[19][20]
Prior to World War II[edit]
As part of the reparations after World War I, Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.[1] In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by Sterling Drug, a predecessor of Sterling Winthrop. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business from SmithKline Beecham and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.[21]
In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered suramin, an anti-parasite drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team of the Pasteur Institute.[22]:378–379[23] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[24]
Bayer became part of IG Farben, a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925. In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists Gerhard Domagk, Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine.[25] Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1939.[26]
World War II[edit]
During World War II, IG Farben used slave labor in factories that it built adjacent to German concentration camps, notably Auschwitz,[27] and the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.[28] IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[29][30] IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."[31] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.[32]
After World War II, the Allies broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.[29] Fritz ter Meer, an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the IG Farben Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[33]
In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of Bayer Corporation, publicly apologized to Elie Wiesel for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in Pittsburgh.[34]
Post World War II[edit]





Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany


In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.[35]
In 1978, Bayer purchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and Cutter Laboratories, acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones vitamins and One-A-Day vitamins, and Cutter insect repellent.[36]
Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's Factor VIII business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat hemophilia, was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified contaminated blood products as a source of infection.[37] According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."[37] Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.[37] But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.[37]
In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a statin drug, Baycol (Cerivastatin) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.[38]
Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.
2000–2009[edit]
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of Roche Pharmaceuticals.[39]
In March 2008, Bayer HealthCare announced an agreement to acquire the portfolio and OTC division of privately owned Sagmel, Inc., a US-based company that markets OTC medications in most of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and others.[40][41] On 2 November 2010, Bayer AG signed an agreement to buy Auckland-based animal health company Bomac Group.[42]
Bayer partnered on the development of the radiotherapeutic Xofigo with Algeta, and in 2014 moved to acquire the company for about $2.9 billion.[43] In 2014, Bayer agreed to buy Merck's consumer health business for $14.2 billion which would provide Bayer control with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Bayer would attain second place globally in nonprescription drugs.[44] In June 2015, Bayer agreed to sell its diabetic care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for a fee of $1.02 billion.[45]
Acquisition of Schering[edit]
In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering AG, which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion[46] and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.[47] Bayer responded with a white knight bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,[48] and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,[47]:49–52[49] and as of 2015 this was one of the ten biggest pharma mergers of all time.[50]
2010 onwards[edit]
Spin off of Covestro[edit]
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called Covestro in which it retained about a 70% interest.[51][52] Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.[51] Covestro shares were first offered on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in October 2015.[53]
Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.[54]
Acquisition of Monsanto[edit]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto for $62 billion.[55] Shortly after Bayer's offer, Monsanto rejected the acquisition bid, seeking a higher price.[56] Bayer attempted to purchase Monsanto again for $66 billion in September 2016, Monsanto accepted this bid and the merger is pending approval.[57][58] As part of the takeover, Bayer agreed to sell both of its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink seeds businesses in order for the deal to pass South Africa's Competition Commission. The divisions being divested had sales worth an estimated $2.5 billion[59]

Corporate structure[edit]
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a holding company. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer AG. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; Bayer MaterialScience AG and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH & Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a life sciences based company.[77] By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.[78][79]

Bayer CropScience[edit]
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. pesticides), nonagricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in genetic engineering of food.[80] In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of Sanofi) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company Plant Genetic Systems became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.[80] Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.[81][82]:270 In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.[83] In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States between 2013 and 2016. A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty. Liberty is used to kill weeds which have grown resistant to Monsanto's product Roundup. [84] In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, Liam Condon.[85]
Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian stock exchanges viz. the Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock Exchange of India and has a market capitalization of $2 billion.[86] Bayer BioScience, headquartered in Hyderabad, India has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across India.[87][88]
Bayer Consumer Health[edit]
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.[80] As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough & Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.[89]
Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements Redoxon and Berocca, and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.[80] Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin. Both pills use a newer type of progesterone hormone called drospirenone in combination with estrogen. Yaz is advertised as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and moderate acne. Other key products include the cancer drug Nexavar, the multiple sclerosis drug betaferon/betaseron and the blood-clotting drug, Kogenate.[80] In May 2014 it was announced that Bayer would buy Merck & Co's consumer health care unit for $14.2 billion.[90] Bayer also controls Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd in China.[91]
Bayer Pharmaceuticals[edit]
The Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s healthcare and cardiology, and also on specialty therapeutics in the areas of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. The division also comprises the Radiology Business Unit which markets contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents.[92]
In addition to internal R&D, Bayer has participated in public–private partnerships. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox program.[93][94] another is the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[95]
Bayer Animal Health[edit]
Bayer HealthCare's Animal Health Division is the maker of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution for dogs and cats, Advantage flea control for cats and dogs and K9 Advantix, a flea, tick, and mosquito control product for dogs. Advantage Multi, K9 Advantix and Advantage are trademarks of Bayer. The division specializes in parasite control and prescription pharmaceuticals for dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. North American operation for the Animal Health Division are headquartered in Shawnee, Kansas. Bayer Animal Health is a division of Bayer HealthCare LLC.[96]
Bayer Business Services[edit]
Bayer Business Services located at the Bayer USA Headquarters in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Bayer Business Services handles the information technology infrastructure and technical support aspect of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. This is also the headquarters of the North American Service Desk, the central IT Help Desk for all of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. Bayer Business Services also employs 4500 specialists in India.[97] Bayer Technology Services is engaged in process development and in process and plant engineering, construction and optimization.[80] Currenta offers services for the chemical industry, including utility supply, waste management, infrastructure, safety, security, analytics and vocational training[80] and is a joint venture between Bayer and Lanxess.[98]
Defunct business units[edit]
Bayer Chemicals AG (with the exception of H.C. Starck and Wolff Walsrode) was combined with certain components of the polymers segment to form the new company Lanxess on 1 July 2004. Lanxess was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in early 2005.[99]
Bayer HealthCare's Diagnostics Division was acquired by Siemens Medical Solutions in January 2007.[100]
Bayer Diabetes Care manages Bayer's medical devices portfolio. Key products include the blood glucose monitors Contour Next EZ (XT), Contour, Contour USB and Breeze 2 used in the management of diabetes.[80] The diabetes business unit was sold to Panasonic Healthcare Co. for $1.15 billion in June 2015[101]
Bayer MaterialScience was a supplier of high-tech polymers, and developed solutions for a broad range of applications relevant to everyday life.[80] On 18 September 2014, the Board of Directors of Bayer AG announced plans to float the Bayer MaterialScience business on the stock market as a separate entity.[102] On 1 June 2015 Bayer announced that the new company would be named Covestro[103] and Bayer formally spun out Covestro in September 2015.[51]
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Pharmaceutical[edit]
In 2014 pharmaceutical products contributed €12.05 billion of Bayer's €40.15 billion in gross revenue.[104] Top-selling products included

Kogenate (recombinant clotting factor VIII). Kogenate is a recombinant version of clotting factor VIII,[105] the absence of deficiency of which causes the abnormal bleeding associated with haemophilia type A. Kogenate is one of several commercially available Factor VIII products having equivalent efficacy.[106]
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a small molecule inhibitor of Factor Xa, a key enzyme involved in blood coagulation. In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.[107] Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as apixaban and dabigatran as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin. It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.[108]
Betaseron is an injectable form of the protein interferon beta used to prevent relapses in the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis.[109] Betaseron competes with other injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and a variety of newer multiple sclerosis drugs, some of which can be taken orally (Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, others).
Yasmin / Yaz birth control pills are part of a group of birth control pill products based on the synthetic progesterone analog drospirenone. Yaz is approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy, to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception, and to treat moderate acne in women at least 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. The FDA has conducted a safety review regarding the potential of Yaz and other drospirenone-containing products to increase the risk of blood clots. Although conflicting results were obtained in different studies, the Agency added a warning to the label that Yaz and related products may be associated with an increased risk of clotting relative to other birth control pill products.[110] Subsequently, a meta analysis suggested that birth control pills of the class Yasmin belongs to raise the risk of blood clots to a greater extent than some other classes of birth control pills.[111]
Nexavar (sorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), and certain types of thyroid cancer.[112]
Trasylol (Aprotinin) Trasylol is a trypsin inhibitor used to control bleeding during major surgery. In a 2006 meeting called by the FDA to review the drug's safety, Bayer scientists failed to reveal the results of an ongoing large study suggesting that Trasylol may increase the risks of death and stroke. According to a FDA official who preferred to remain anonymous, the FDA learned of the study only through information provided to the FDA by a whistleblowing scientist who was involved in it.[113][114] The study concluded Trasylol carried greater risks of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. On 15 December of the same year the FDA restricted the use of Trasylol,[115] and in November 2007 they requested that the company suspend marketing.[116] In 2011, Health Canada lifted its suspension of Trasylol for its originally approved indication of limiting bleeding in coronary bypass surgery, citing flaws in the design of the studies that led to its suspension.[117] This decision was controversial.[118][119] In 2013 the European Medicines Agency lifted its suspension of the Trasylol marketing authorization for selected patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, citing a favorable risk-benefit ratio.[120]
Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Ciprofloxacin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[121][122] In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US.[123]
Rennie antacid tablets, one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £29.8 million.[124]

Agricultural[edit]
Bayer produces various fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and some crop varieties.[125]

Fungicides are primarily marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, and control of mildew and rust diseases.[126] Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin tebuconazole.[127][128] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole,[129] while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.[130]
Herbicides are marketed primarily for field crops and orchards.[131] Liberty brands containing glufosinate are used for general weed control.[132] Capreno containing a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl and tembotrione is used for grass and broad-leaf control.[133]
Insecticides are marketed according to specific crop and insect pest type.[134] Foliar insecticides include Belt containing flubendiamide, which is marketed against Lepidopteran pests,[135] and Movento containing spirotetramat, which is marketed against sucking insects.[136] Neonicotinoids such clothianidin and imidacloprid are used as systemic seed treatments products such as Poncho and Goucho.[137][138] In 2008 neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impacts starting in Germany. Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[139][140][141] Parathion was discovered by scientists at IG Farben in the 1940s as an cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide. Its use is banned in most developed countries.[142] Propoxur is a carbamate insecticide that was introduced by Bayer in 1959.[143]

Bayer 04 Leverkusen[edit]
Main article: Bayer 04 Leverkusen
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now KFC Uerdingen 05).[144]
Chemical accident[edit]
On 28 August 2008, an explosion occurred at the Bayer CropScience facility at Institute, West Virginia, United States. A runaway reaction ruptured a tank and the resulting explosion killed two employees.[145] The ruptured tank was close to a methyl isocyanate tank which was undamaged by the explosion.[146]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In October 2008, Bayer's Canadian division was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The Canadian division was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star newspaper.[147] Bayer USA was given a score of 85 (out of 100) in the Human Rights Campaign's 2011 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of gay and lesbian workplace equality.[148]
In 2016, Standard Ethics Aei has given a rating to Bayer in order to include the company in its Standard Ethics German Index. Bayer has received an EE- rating, which is the fourth tier in an eight tier ranking.[149]

Bayer facility in Leverkusen


Bayer AG (/ˈbeɪər/ or /ˈbaɪər/); German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ɐ]) is a German multinational chemical, pharmaceutical and life sciences company. It is headquartered in Leverkusen, where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The company's motto is "science for a better life."
Bayer's first and best known product was aspirin; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, Arthur Eichengrün or Felix Hoffmann. Bayer trademarked the name "heroin" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced phenobarbital, prontosil, the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine, the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin), and Yaz (drospirenone) birth control pills. In 2014 Bayer bought MSD's consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops genetically modified crops and pesticides. Its materials science division makes polymers like polyurethanes and polycarbonate.
Bayer was founded in Barmen in 1863. It was part of IG Farben, the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder during the early Cold War and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired Schering in 2006 and announced its acquisition of Monsanto in 2016.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Bayer AG was founded in Barmen (today a part of Wuppertal), Germany in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.[1]




Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen


The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.[5]:51 An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen, the location of Bayer AG's headquarters.[6]
Aspirin[edit]
Bayer's first major product was acetylsalicylic acid (originally discovered by French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt in 1853), a modification of salicylic acid or salicin, a folk remedy found in the bark of the willow plant.[7][8] By 1899, Bayer's trademark Aspirin was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during World War I by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.[9] It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland. As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.[10] It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[11]
There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. Arthur Eichengrün, a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an aspirin formulation which did not have the unpleasant side effects of nausea and gastric pain. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by Felix Hoffmann to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had arthritis. Various sources support the conflicting claims.[12][13] Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.[14][15]
Heroin[edit]




Bayer Heroin bottle


Heroin (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.[16] Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[17] Heroin was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.[18]
Phenobarbital[edit]
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of phenobarbital in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.[19][20]
Prior to World War II[edit]
As part of the reparations after World War I, Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.[1] In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by Sterling Drug, a predecessor of Sterling Winthrop. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business from SmithKline Beecham and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.[21]
In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered suramin, an anti-parasite drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team of the Pasteur Institute.[22]:378–379[23] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[24]
Bayer became part of IG Farben, a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925. In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists Gerhard Domagk, Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered prontosil, the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine.[25] Domagk received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work in 1939.[26]
World War II[edit]
During World War II, IG Farben used slave labor in factories that it built adjacent to German concentration camps, notably Auschwitz,[27] and the sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.[28] IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.[29][30] IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."[31] IG Farben held a large investment in Degesch which produced Zyklon B used to gas and kill prisoners during the Holocaust.[32]
After World War II, the Allies broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.[29] Fritz ter Meer, an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the IG Farben Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. He was elected Bayer's supervisory board head in 1956.[33]
In 1995, Helge Wehmeier, the head of Bayer Corporation, publicly apologized to Elie Wiesel for the company's involvement in the Holocaust at a lecture in Pittsburgh.[34]
Post World War II[edit]





Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany


In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.[35]
In 1978, Bayer purchased Miles Laboratories and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and Cutter Laboratories, acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including Alka-Seltzer, Flintstones vitamins and One-A-Day vitamins, and Cutter insect repellent.[36]
Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's Factor VIII business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat hemophilia, was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified contaminated blood products as a source of infection.[37] According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."[37] Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.[37] But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.[37]
In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a statin drug, Baycol (Cerivastatin) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.[38]
Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.
2000–2009[edit]
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of Roche Pharmaceuticals.[39]
In March 2008, Bayer HealthCare announced an agreement to acquire the portfolio and OTC division of privately owned Sagmel, Inc., a US-based company that markets OTC medications in most of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and others.[40][41] On 2 November 2010, Bayer AG signed an agreement to buy Auckland-based animal health company Bomac Group.[42]
Bayer partnered on the development of the radiotherapeutic Xofigo with Algeta, and in 2014 moved to acquire the company for about $2.9 billion.[43] In 2014, Bayer agreed to buy Merck's consumer health business for $14.2 billion which would provide Bayer control with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Bayer would attain second place globally in nonprescription drugs.[44] In June 2015, Bayer agreed to sell its diabetic care business to Panasonic Healthcare Holdings for a fee of $1.02 billion.[45]
Acquisition of Schering[edit]
In March 2006, Merck KGaA announced a €14.6bn bid for Schering AG, which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion[46] and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.[47] Bayer responded with a white knight bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,[48] and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma. The acquisition of Schering was the largest take-over in Bayer's history,[47]:49–52[49] and as of 2015 this was one of the ten biggest pharma mergers of all time.[50]
2010 onwards[edit]
Spin off of Covestro[edit]
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called Covestro in which it retained about a 70% interest.[51][52] Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.[51] Covestro shares were first offered on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in October 2015.[53]
Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.[54]
Acquisition of Monsanto[edit]
In May 2016, Bayer offered to buy U.S. seeds company Monsanto for $62 billion.[55] Shortly after Bayer's offer, Monsanto rejected the acquisition bid, seeking a higher price.[56] Bayer attempted to purchase Monsanto again for $66 billion in September 2016, Monsanto accepted this bid and the merger is pending approval.[57][58] As part of the takeover, Bayer agreed to sell both of its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink seeds businesses in order for the deal to pass South Africa's Competition Commission. The divisions being divested had sales worth an estimated $2.5 billion[59]

Corporate structure[edit]
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a holding company. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer AG. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; Bayer MaterialScience AG and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH & Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a life sciences based company.[77] By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.[78][79]

Bayer CropScience[edit]
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. pesticides), nonagricultural pest control, seeds and plant biotechnology. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in genetic engineering of food.[80] In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of Sanofi) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company Plant Genetic Systems became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.[80] Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.[81][82]:270 In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.[83] In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States between 2013 and 2016. A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty. Liberty is used to kill weeds which have grown resistant to Monsanto's product Roundup. [84] In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, Liam Condon.[85]
Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian stock exchanges viz. the Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock Exchange of India and has a market capitalization of $2 billion.[86] Bayer BioScience, headquartered in Hyderabad, India has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across India.[87][88]
Bayer Consumer Health[edit]
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.[80] As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough & Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.[89]
Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements Redoxon and Berocca, and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.[80] Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills Yaz and Yasmin. Both pills use a newer type of progesterone hormone called drospirenone in combination with estrogen. Yaz is advertised as a treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and moderate acne. Other key products include the cancer drug Nexavar, the multiple sclerosis drug betaferon/betaseron and the blood-clotting drug, Kogenate.[80] In May 2014 it was announced that Bayer would buy Merck & Co's consumer health care unit for $14.2 billion.[90] Bayer also controls Dihon Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd in China.[91]
Bayer Pharmaceuticals[edit]
The Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on prescription products, especially for women’s healthcare and cardiology, and also on specialty therapeutics in the areas of oncology, hematology and ophthalmology. The division also comprises the Radiology Business Unit which markets contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents.[92]
In addition to internal R&D, Bayer has participated in public–private partnerships. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox program.[93][94] another is the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[95]
Bayer Animal Health[edit]
Bayer HealthCare's Animal Health Division is the maker of Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution for dogs and cats, Advantage flea control for cats and dogs and K9 Advantix, a flea, tick, and mosquito control product for dogs. Advantage Multi, K9 Advantix and Advantage are trademarks of Bayer. The division specializes in parasite control and prescription pharmaceuticals for dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. North American operation for the Animal Health Division are headquartered in Shawnee, Kansas. Bayer Animal Health is a division of Bayer HealthCare LLC.[96]
Bayer Business Services[edit]
Bayer Business Services located at the Bayer USA Headquarters in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Bayer Business Services handles the information technology infrastructure and technical support aspect of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. This is also the headquarters of the North American Service Desk, the central IT Help Desk for all of Bayer USA and Bayer Canada. Bayer Business Services also employs 4500 specialists in India.[97] Bayer Technology Services is engaged in process development and in process and plant engineering, construction and optimization.[80] Currenta offers services for the chemical industry, including utility supply, waste management, infrastructure, safety, security, analytics and vocational training[80] and is a joint venture between Bayer and Lanxess.[98]
Defunct business units[edit]
Bayer Chemicals AG (with the exception of H.C. Starck and Wolff Walsrode) was combined with certain components of the polymers segment to form the new company Lanxess on 1 July 2004. Lanxess was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in early 2005.[99]
Bayer HealthCare's Diagnostics Division was acquired by Siemens Medical Solutions in January 2007.[100]
Bayer Diabetes Care manages Bayer's medical devices portfolio. Key products include the blood glucose monitors Contour Next EZ (XT), Contour, Contour USB and Breeze 2 used in the management of diabetes.[80] The diabetes business unit was sold to Panasonic Healthcare Co. for $1.15 billion in June 2015[101]
Bayer MaterialScience was a supplier of high-tech polymers, and developed solutions for a broad range of applications relevant to everyday life.[80] On 18 September 2014, the Board of Directors of Bayer AG announced plans to float the Bayer MaterialScience business on the stock market as a separate entity.[102] On 1 June 2015 Bayer announced that the new company would be named Covestro[103] and Bayer formally spun out Covestro in September 2015.[51]
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Pharmaceutical[edit]
In 2014 pharmaceutical products contributed €12.05 billion of Bayer's €40.15 billion in gross revenue.[104] Top-selling products included

Kogenate (recombinant clotting factor VIII). Kogenate is a recombinant version of clotting factor VIII,[105] the absence of deficiency of which causes the abnormal bleeding associated with haemophilia type A. Kogenate is one of several commercially available Factor VIII products having equivalent efficacy.[106]
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a small molecule inhibitor of Factor Xa, a key enzyme involved in blood coagulation. In the United States, the FDA has approved rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people undergoing hip surgery.[107] Rivaroxaban competes with other newer generation anticoagulants such as apixaban and dabigatran as well as with the generic anticoagulant warfarin. It has similar efficacy to warfarin and is associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding, but unlike warfarin there is no established protocol for rapidly reversing its effects in the event of uncontrolled bleeding or the need for emergency surgery.[108]
Betaseron is an injectable form of the protein interferon beta used to prevent relapses in the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis.[109] Betaseron competes with other injectable forms of interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, and a variety of newer multiple sclerosis drugs, some of which can be taken orally (Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, others).
Yasmin / Yaz birth control pills are part of a group of birth control pill products based on the synthetic progesterone analog drospirenone. Yaz is approved in the United States for the prevention of pregnancy, to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception, and to treat moderate acne in women at least 14 years of age who choose an oral contraceptive for contraception. The FDA has conducted a safety review regarding the potential of Yaz and other drospirenone-containing products to increase the risk of blood clots. Although conflicting results were obtained in different studies, the Agency added a warning to the label that Yaz and related products may be associated with an increased risk of clotting relative to other birth control pill products.[110] Subsequently, a meta analysis suggested that birth control pills of the class Yasmin belongs to raise the risk of blood clots to a greater extent than some other classes of birth control pills.[111]
Nexavar (sorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), and certain types of thyroid cancer.[112]
Trasylol (Aprotinin) Trasylol is a trypsin inhibitor used to control bleeding during major surgery. In a 2006 meeting called by the FDA to review the drug's safety, Bayer scientists failed to reveal the results of an ongoing large study suggesting that Trasylol may increase the risks of death and stroke. According to a FDA official who preferred to remain anonymous, the FDA learned of the study only through information provided to the FDA by a whistleblowing scientist who was involved in it.[113][114] The study concluded Trasylol carried greater risks of death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. On 15 December of the same year the FDA restricted the use of Trasylol,[115] and in November 2007 they requested that the company suspend marketing.[116] In 2011, Health Canada lifted its suspension of Trasylol for its originally approved indication of limiting bleeding in coronary bypass surgery, citing flaws in the design of the studies that led to its suspension.[117] This decision was controversial.[118][119] In 2013 the European Medicines Agency lifted its suspension of the Trasylol marketing authorization for selected patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, citing a favorable risk-benefit ratio.[120]
Cipro (ciprofloxacin) Ciprofloxacin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolone antibiotics that came into clinical use in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[121][122] In 2010, over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th-most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th-most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US.[123]
Rennie antacid tablets, one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £29.8 million.[124]

Agricultural[edit]
Bayer produces various fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and some crop varieties.[125]

Fungicides are primarily marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, and control of mildew and rust diseases.[126] Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin tebuconazole.[127][128] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole,[129] while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.[130]
Herbicides are marketed primarily for field crops and orchards.[131] Liberty brands containing glufosinate are used for general weed control.[132] Capreno containing a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl and tembotrione is used for grass and broad-leaf control.[133]
Insecticides are marketed according to specific crop and insect pest type.[134] Foliar insecticides include Belt containing flubendiamide, which is marketed against Lepidopteran pests,[135] and Movento containing spirotetramat, which is marketed against sucking insects.[136] Neonicotinoids such clothianidin and imidacloprid are used as systemic seed treatments products such as Poncho and Goucho.[137][138] In 2008 neonicotinoids came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impacts starting in Germany. Neonicotinoid use has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.[139][140][141] Parathion was discovered by scientists at IG Farben in the 1940s as an cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide. Its use is banned in most developed countries.[142] Propoxur is a carbamate insecticide that was introduced by Bayer in 1959.[143]

Bayer 04 Leverkusen[edit]
Main article: Bayer 04 Leverkusen
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now KFC Uerdingen 05).[144]
Chemical accident[edit]
On 28 August 2008, an explosion occurred at the Bayer CropScience facility at Institute, West Virginia, United States. A runaway reaction ruptured a tank and the resulting explosion killed two employees.[145] The ruptured tank was close to a methyl isocyanate tank which was undamaged by the explosion.[146]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In October 2008, Bayer's Canadian division was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The Canadian division was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by the Toronto Star newspaper.[147] Bayer USA was given a score of 85 (out of 100) in the Human Rights Campaign's 2011 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of gay and lesbian workplace equality.[148]
In 2016, Standard Ethics Aei has given a rating to Bayer in order to include the company in its Standard Ethics German Index. Bayer has received an EE- rating, which is the fourth tier in an eight tier ranking.[149]

Bayer AG, German chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer (1825–80), who was a chemical salesman, and Johann Friedrich Weskott (1821–76), who owned a dye company. Company headquarters, originally in Barmen (now Wuppertal), have been in Leverkusen, north of Cologne, since 1912.An early bottle of Bayer aspirin, sold in powdered form.Bayer CorporationThe company was originally called Friedr. Bayer et comp. and manufactured dyestuffs; in 1881 it was incorporated as Farbenfabriken vormals Friedr. Bayer & Co. Aspirin, the chance invention of Bayer chemist Felix Hoffmann (1868–1946), was introduced by the company in 1899. In 1912 Carl Duisberg (1861–1935), a chemist, became Bayer’s general director and soon began spearheading the movement that would result in 1925 in the consolidation of Germany’s chemical industries known as IG Farben; Duisberg was IG Farben’s first chairman, and Bayer remained within the cartel until it was dissolved by the Allies in 1945.In 1951 an independent Bayer was reestablished as Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft; the current name was adopted in 1972. From 1981 to 1999 Bayer held a controlling interest in the Agfa-Gevaert Group, a German and Belgian producer of photographic equipment and film, magnetic tape, and photocopying and duplicating machines. Bayer continued to expand its holdings with such notable acquisitions as Schering AG (2006), a German pharmaceutical firm that was the largest maker of birth control pills. In addition, Bayer diversified, establishing a crop science division in 2002. In 2016 the company announced that it was purchasing Monsanto, an American producer of agricultural products; the deal was valued at $66 billion.The company’s trademark, the Bayer cross, is internationally recognized. Scores of pharmaceuticals, dyes, acetates, synthetic rubbers, plastics, fibres, insecticides, and other chemicals were first developed by Bayer. In addition to being the originator and first marketer of aspirin (1899), Bayer was the first company to mass-produce heroin for use in pain and cough medications (1898). It introduced the first sulfa drug, Prontosil (1935), and developed polyurethane (1937), a base material for synthetic foams, paints, adhesives, fibres, and other goods.

Bayer Aktiengesellschaft Key Developments

Bayer Invests €92 Million in Animal Health Production
Jul 3 17
Bayer aims to further grow its Animal Health Business. Until 2021, the company plans to invest around €92 million into the further development of the production site in Kiel, where some of the most important products for the global market are being manufactured. The goal is to strengthen particularly the growing business in the companion animal segment. Especially the rising demand for collars against fleas and ticks requires further investments into new production facilities and sophisticated filling and packaging lines. Another focus lies on expanding the production of pipettes with liquid parasite protection for pets. Other liquid products as well as an optimized production of pills for companion and farm animals will be supported with millions. In addition, Bayer will invest into stepping up the site's infrastructure.


BASF Consider To Buy Seed Assets
Jun 29 17
BASF SE (DB:BAS) will consider buying seed assets that rivals are putting on the block to win antitrust approval for tie-ups, saying bargain prices could persuade BASF to overcome its traditional reluctance to expand into the seeds industry. Martin Brudermueller, Chief Executive Officer of BASF SE said,""Seed assets are an option, not a must,". Rival Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (DB:BAYN) said in May,"it will sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses, a key part of asset sales required to satisfy competition authorities looking at its $66 billion Monsanto deal.

FUTURE OF FARMING
VARIETY SELECTOR TOOL







Infinite Innovation
At Crop Science, a division of Bayer, we know that the world of farming is ever evolving. Fields change, weeds adapt, temperatures fluctuate. As they do, products need to change too. That’s why we place innovation at the center of our business. To make your job easier from seed to harvest, our bioscientists and agronomists turn extensive field research into biotechnology solutions.
A Rich Product Portfolio
To help farmers control existing crop threats and get ahead of emerging ones, we are constantly updating our diverse product portfolio of seeds, seed treatments, traits, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and harvest aids/PGRs. Our products offer proven broad-spectrum disease, pest and weed control, easier crop management and the timesaving technologies for maximizing crop production and enhancing profitability.

Flea bites can hurt your cat—and your cat’s health
Seeing a flea on your clean, well-cared for cat can be a horrifying experience. In addition to the major “ick” factor fleas bring, they can bite your cat, causing pain and leading to health issues.
Examine flea risks ›







Myth: Ticks don’t harm cats
You’ve probably heard of Lyme disease, which can affect dogs. Luckily, it doesn’t affect cats. But there are other diseases caused by ticks that can be deadly to cats. Learn about the risks and how to prevent ticks on cats.
Understand tick disease risk ›







Fleas aren’t just annoying – they can cause health issues
Fleas can be intensely irritating for your dog — and you — and not just in the “annoying” sense of the word. Even a few fleas can pose health risks for your dog.
Discover flea risks›







Tick disease: It only takes one bite
When a tick pierces your dog’s skin to feed on blood, it can transmit dangerous diseases like Lyme disease. Find out more about the threat ticks pose and how you can help prevent ticks on dogs.

Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

When fleas, ticks and mosquitoes bite your dog, they can cause irritation and transmit deadly diseases. But not all products work the same.K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks AND mosquitoes through contact. No biting required. Now that's a wise choice.
Buy near me










									No biting required.
								
Veterinarian-recommended K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice, and repels biting flies. And because it works through contact, there’s no biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.



Learn how fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can have a negative effect on the health of your dog, and much more.Can't seem to get rid of those fleas?Learn More >Tick disease: It only takes one bite. Learn More >Mosquitoes: A little insect that carries big health risks.Learn More >


















We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.
