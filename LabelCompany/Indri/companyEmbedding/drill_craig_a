Awesome Product






			Posted by Dan on 12th Aug 2014
		
I recently purchased the Craig's No Drill Custom License Plate Bracket for my 2014 Shelby GT500.  I couldn't be happier.  It came with clear and easy to understand installation instructions that included color photos.  It only takes about a minute to install it.  The parts of the bracket that make contact with the car are covered with rubber so that there no chafing of the car.  And the bracket comes off in seconds too, which is great for taking pictures of the car or putting in a car show.




Looks and works Great

The bracket is simple enough to take on and off easily. Looks perfect on the car and is very strong.

Customer Questions & Answers








            Can this tool be used on 2X4's as well as 1x4s
        


Asked by: Jackson

            Yes, I just finished building a miter saw table and I used it on 2x4's.  It does a great job on 2x4's as long as you adjust it for different size boards

The Kreg jig is amazing. Absolutely the best tool. Easy to use, makes the job easy and clean. Really fast to set up and use. I don't know how I would have completed this project without it. I am not a master woodworker. Benches are done (easy to assemble) and the rest of the table is turning out great!

this is the most ingenious tool that I have ever used.

Let me start by saying that this does come with one clamp. The picture does not show it, so i was pleasantly surprised when unopened the box.

It comes with every piece you need (other than the drill) to start building cabinets, tables. They even give you a few plugs and screws, but you can pic up more cheap at the store.

as for use, I never used one of these before, so i figured it would be hard. I was completely wrong as they made this very straight forward. (the engineers should be proud of themselves for how simple it is to use. 

The bit that comes with this is sharp, and drills out a perfect hole every time. the plugs also fit in perfectly after drilled. 

The build if the jig is heavy duty molded plastic, but the pocket holes are lined with hardened metal to prevent damage to the inside guides.

The clamps work perfectly, and they keep the wood tight and secure while drilling. The only issue I had was that the bit adjustment piece is hard to put in and take out, so i hope that will loosen a bit. I also wish it came with a case, but I can deal with that.

I absolutely love this jig, and now understand why it has so many great reviews. I will definitely be looking into other items from Kreg

        the carpenters secret little helper
I bought the pocket screw jig system as I saw it was an essential tool for a project I had just gotten plans for. I had never used or seen one before and had always just accepted the appearance of screws as an inevitable reality of novice carpentry work. The ability to conceal fasteners has brought my furniture creations to a more professional level and the jig is a very intuitive tool to use with basic instructions. Makes you look like you knew what you were doing all along.

As a novice woodworker, I found this tool to be very simple to operate. After trying a simple project, a small stool for the bathroom, I'm encouraged to take on other projects like a cabinet in the garage to hide a large salt-free water softener system and allow me to put pegboards on both doors for my wife's light cleaning tools (dust mop, brooms and Swiffers). This is going to lead me into getting a doweling jig next and down the road a planer.

I found the instructions included were a little vague. Incorrect placement of the drill guide, led me drilling through the base, but to a minimum extent. I found a YouTube video to help in the proper operation and setting up. Coincidentally, it was a link off of the Kreg site. After I got the drill stop properly installed the product lived up to its reputation, as a precise woodworking jig and I was able to complete my project.

this is my first time making pocket holes, great product, easy to use. I have plenty of experience working with wood, grew up with a father who was an expert cabinet builder.  If you are new to woodworking, I would recommend practicing with this tool before beginning your project.  Make sure to use the correct size screws and use the Kreg screws.

I am a DIYer who wanted to try building furniture for the first time. During the research phase of my venture, I came across a few DIYer blogs that recommended using a Kreg Jig to make pocket holes for easy furniture making. I have to agree with them, this made life A LOT easier. I was using 3/4" boards for my end tables and with this, it was easy to adjust for the size board I would need. The instruction manual explains which drill holes to use and also how to align the drill bit for the right depth with the collar. I ended up using 1 1/4" screws for 3/4" to 3/4" boards, but there was a screw guide included as well as references to online resources should you need more information. I had no issue with the drill bit after drilling enough holes for 3 end tables and the box includes a variety of screws in fine thread so you know what to buy in the kreg boxes. Overall I am very pleased with this item, and will be using it for many years to come.

For me, the Kreg has mades wood joinery much quicker, and as a bonus, the fasteners are hidden.  I am impressed with the strength of the joints, better than I had imagined.  The choice of using the drilling guide in the jig, or out as a portable guide is quite helpful.  Glad I made this purchase.

            What are the 3 parts?
        

            It says the kit combines 3 must-haves, but I'm unsure what they are. The circular saw, drill and what - a drill guide?
        
Asked by: Alpets

            There's a small Kreg screw joining set (with some starter screws, practice on some scrap wood first!), a shelf peg jig for drilling perfectly aligned shelf peg holes, and a skill saw guide that screws to the saw to rip perfect straight lines (up to 24&quot; across).

            What type of screws?
        

            Do I have to purchase a special type of screw to use this kit? If not; what type do I need when working with 3/4 inch to sheets of wood? What thickness wood is recommended for drawers?
        
Asked by: Chiris

            You should use special joining screws made for the different types of woods (plywood, solid wood...) They are readily available at most hardware stores. There are instructions is the kit that explain what you should use (or google Kreg for the info)

        Works Just Like I Wanted It To
The rip cut jig is great. I will never wrestle sheets of plywood through a table saw again. Just set the width cut you want, line up the guide, and walk the saw down the board. Let the saw do the work. The only complaint I have is the clamp where you set your width has a tendency to pop out of place while you are trying to close it. The lever is a cam lock and will pop loose if you apply pressure unevenly or too heavily. It pops back on easily but it can be aggravating. Just make sure you have everthing lined up and don't try to gorrilla it into place. The pocket screw jig makes my life much easier when I'm building screen doors or reinforcing corners. These tools are well worth the price.
