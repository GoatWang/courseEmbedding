China Pharma Holdings, Inc. Retains CCG Elite




Los Angeles - China Pharma Holdings, Inc. has retained CCG Elite to administer and execute its investor relations campaign. China Pharma is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and markets generic and brand products in China for a wide range of conditions, including infections, cardiovascular and CNS diseases, hepatitis, and Alzheimer's disease.

"China Pharma Holding, Inc. is aggressively pursuing a strategy of growth in revenue and market share in China," commented Li Zhi Lin, President and CEO. "Our strong performance in the first quarter of 2006 proves the strength of our business model. We will continue to grow by targeting the markets for stroke, heart attack, and hepatitis with our newly approved drugs."

China Pharma recently received approvals from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to manufacture and market three new generic products that target the rapidly growing stroke and heart attack markets in China: Ozagrel, Propylgallate, and Alginic Sodium Diester. It also just launched Hepatocyte Growth-promoting Factor (pHGF), which is indicated for the adjunct treatment of hepatitis at various stages.

"China Pharma has the pipeline and infrastructure to become a leading player in the rapidly developing multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical market in China," commented Crocker Coulson, President of CCG Elite. "Its extensive sales force and manufacturing base fuelled a 60% increase in revenue and a 53% jump in net income, and contributed to a 34% net margin in the first quarter of 2006. China Pharma's success will help it to gain attention in the US investment community."

AboutUS

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
DO NOT GO GENTLE
Today's breakthroughs are becoming tomorrow's medicines.

We have long been driven to explore. To discover. To push our human limits. Two hundred years ago, we headed west. Today, we orbit Jupiter.
But for as far as we’ve gone, there is nothing so “out there” as what’s “in here” – inside our human bodies. The billions of cells that make us who we are and their systems, functions and mysteries that researchers are uncovering to defeat disease and save, improve and extend life.
Welcome to the future of medicine.
Welcome to a new world where immunotherapy unleashes your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. Welcome to medicines that are made using the body’s own living cells, not chemical compounds. Welcome to genomics and personalized medicine, which can be used to tailor treatments most unique to you and most devastating to your disease. 
This is an age of promise – fueled by the will to climb the many mountains ahead to defeat disease and explore the space within the frontier of the body.
Every day, we will go there. To find the unfindable. Solve the unsolvable. Cure the incurable.
140,000 researchers strong and relentless. Together, we go boldly.

AboutUS

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
DO NOT GO GENTLE
Today's breakthroughs are becoming tomorrow's medicines.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.
