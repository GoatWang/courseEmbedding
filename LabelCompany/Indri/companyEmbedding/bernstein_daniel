Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

One of the things that really gave me a lot of confidence, as Corum took us through the process, was that ultimately, a deal is about the people. It’s about chemistry, the fit, the synergy between the people involved.

Where?My current locationSearchHomePhiladelphia, PABernstein Daniel SNortheast Philadelphia Philadelphia, PA Bernstein Daniel SAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Dr. Daniel BernsteinBBB Rating: A+301 Bainbridge StPhiladelphia, PA 19147(215) 925-733010.4 milesDentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Bernstein Harvey A Podiatrist7001 Large StPhiladelphia, PA 19149(215) 342-81242.2 milesPhysicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Kanter Bernstein & Kardon Attys1617 John F Kennedy Blvd Ste 1150Philadelphia, PA 19103(215) 568-588510.2 milesAttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Bernstein, Alan1635 Market StPhiladelphia, PA 19103(215) 567-201010.3 milesAttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Joseph Bernstein MD51 N 39th St Ste 1Philadelphia, PA 19104(215) 349-886211 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Joseph Bernstein MD3400 Spruce StPhiladelphia, PA 19104(215) 662-800011.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Bernstein, Eric F, MD211 S 9th StPhiladelphia, PA 19107(215) 955-668010.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Kanter Bernstein & Kardon PC1617 John F Kennedy BlvdPhiladelphia, PA 19103(215) 568-588510.2 milesAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Caesar Rivise Bernstein Cohen & Pokotilow Ltd1635 Market St Fl 11Philadelphia, PA 19103(215) 567-201010.3 milesAttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Bernstein Leonard A AttyLiberty PlPhiladelphia, PA 19103(215) 851-814310.3 milesAttorneysLegal Service PlansWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection11. Jeffrey I Bernstein Attorney123 S Broad StPhiladelphia, PA 19109(215) 772-749710.3 milesGeneral Practice AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Deborah Bernstein MD202 W Rittenhouse SqPhiladelphia, PA 19103(215) 790-031310.6 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Bernstein, Joseph3900 Woodland AvePhiladelphia, PA 19104(215) 823-631411.5 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED14. Dr. Richard Bernstein Dentistry(6)BBB Rating: A+1401 Marlton Pike WCherry Hill, NJ 08002(856) 229-003710.5 milesDentistsCosmetic DentistryWebsiteVirtual TourDirectionsServicesMore InfoDr. Bernstein is the man!!!
