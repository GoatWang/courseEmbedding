Investment Strategies
More than 18 years ago, Argent Capital® was founded to provide a Large Cap Growth strategy based on the firm’s investment philosophy that companies with favorable valuation, management teams who understand capital allocation and catalysts that drive acceleration and growth offer unique investment opportunities. The Argent Large Cap Growth strategy considers a universe of industry-leading U.S. companies with equity market capitalizations of $3 billion or greater. In 2005, Argent® launched a complementary Dividend Select strategy and a Small Cap strategy in 2008 both of which are based upon the same investment philosophy as our Large Cap strategy.
The Small Cap strategy capitalizes on the intersection of solid valuation, accelerating growth and catalysts that we believe are not quickly recognized by the investment community.  Argent’s Small Cap strategy considers a universe of companies with equity market capitalization of less than $3 billion each.
Today the firm manages more than $2.6 billion in assets in Large Cap Growth and Small Cap Equity portfolios for endowments, foundations, pension funds and successful individuals.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

What are analysts saying about Pentair PLC. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pentair PLC. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pentair has outperformed the Zacks sub-industry year to date. Pentair expects full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $3.45–$3.55 and revenues to approximately $4.8 billion. The company will gain from continued dealer wins, strong product innovations and the sale of Valves & Controls. It also remains focused on making progress in building order channel. Further, Pentair's focus on price increases will help mitigate cost inflation. The company also has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/12/2017)
2. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "Given signs of a bottoming in the latter, and PNR's late-cycle sales mix, we think this out-growth is unlikely to accelerate. While its markets are strong now, we note that PNR's cyclicality was no lower than the sector average during the 2009 downturn," analyst Julian Mitchell wrote in a note. That said, Mitchell noted that the company should continue to record strong margin growth, while its operating margins have increased by about 300bps over the past three years.Related Link: Cowen & Company Downgrades Pentair To Underperform"We view five business units (-30 percent of sales) as 'under-earning' today, in that they offer 300bps+ of margin expansion opportunity; we assume that two-thirds of this opportunity (equating to $0.18–0.20 of EPS) is indeed realized in the next few years," Mitchell continued. Meanwhile, investors would focus on how the company deploys its V&C proceeds, while the company is keen to put the remaining balance sheet capacity of $1.4 billion to work.Mitchell said although the move would add $0.45 to EPS, it would increase the leverage "at the very top of the large-cap EE/MI leverage spectrum (implying ~3X ND /EBITDA), and back to a level which management apparently found too high."Notably, the main aim behind the sale of V&C was to reduce the leverage."There is a risk that PNR uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough (V&C), to buy businesses that may be close to a cyclical peak (in Water, TS), and the company seems willing to return to a similar balance sheet leverage level (3X) as before the V&C sale took place," (9/26/2016)
