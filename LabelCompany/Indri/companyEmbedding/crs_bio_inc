			Welcome to CRS Products International			


Glass plays an important part functionally and aesthetically in todays architecture. The creative use of glass in giving a whole new look for squash - racquetball - handball courts. CRS Products International is proud of the part they play in this highly innovative field, maintaining rigid standards for the largest or smallest orders.
 
CRS Products International is a FULL SERVICE company offering complete court engineering packages and consulting services. We have the creative talent, experience and expertise to achieve your sports construction glass requirements on time and WITHIN OR BELOW BUDGET.
 
Since 1972 CRS has been the leader in squash - racquetball - handball court, sports glass wall construction systems throughout the USA, Canada and International markets.
 
Manufactured to meet all governing body requirements for safety and performance criteria.
 
When annealed glass is heated to near its softening point, then its surface is rapidly cooled while the inner core is allowed to cool naturally, the resulting product is tempered glass. Layers of high compression on the surface are counter balanced by high tension at the centre of the glass thus achieving a glass that is four to five times stronger than annealed glass. Tempered glass is usually installed to assure greater uniform load strength, lessen the possibility of mechanical or thermal breakage through stress or in areas where safety glass is specified.
CRS has all the facilities for custom fabrication of tempered glass. Edge work, hole drilling, cutouts, etc. are all done before the tempering process. CRS tempered glass comes in clear for optimum transparency.

Mission statement
Catholic Relief Services carries out the commitment of the Bishops of the United States to assist the poor and vulnerable overseas. We are motivated by the Gospel of Jesus Christ to cherish, preserve and uphold the sacredness and dignity of all human life, foster charity and justice, and embody Catholic social and moral teaching as we act to:
PROMOTE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT by responding to major emergencies, fighting disease and poverty, and nurturing peaceful and just societies; and,
SERVE CATHOLICS IN THE UNITED STATES as they live their faith in solidarity with their brothers and sisters around the world.
As part of the universal mission of the Catholic Church, we work with local, national and international Catholic institutions and structures, as well as other organizations, to assist people on the basis of need, not creed, race or nationality.
Approved by the Catholic Relief Services Board of Directors on September 11, 2008. 
 
We put our faith into action to help the world’s poorest create lasting change.









Faith: Faith is our foundation. We have faith in the people we serve and our shared ability to build a more just and peaceful world.
Action: The desire to serve is not enough. We must act collaboratively to bring about real improvements in peoples’ quality of life and genuine engagement in building peace and justice.
Results: Demonstrated through measureable outcomes, our actions must be effective in alleviating human suffering, removing root causes and empowering people to achieve their full potential.
