Prior to joining HWVP, Mr. Hickey served as CEO for Critical Path, Inc., where during his tenure revenue grew from less than $1M to more than $150M and the company earned Forbes.com Number-One Fastest Growing Company Award in 2000. Mr. Hickey previously held the CEO and President position for Global Center Inc., where he grew revenue from zero to more than $50M of recurring revenue and achieved profitability. His focus on the company's strategy enabled rapid growth, securing customers like Yahoo, Netscape and Oracle, ultimately leading to the successful sale of the company to Frontier Communications Corporation, (NASDAQ:FTR). Prior to Global Center, Mr. Hickey was CEO and President of MFS DataNet, the leading supplier of data related services to internet service providers and enterprise customers worldwide. MFS grew to more than $1 billion in revenue and subsequently completed a successful IPO and trade sale. We believe Mr. Hickey's qualifications to sit on our Board include his extensive corporate leadership experience and his proven background growing revenue.

Ambassador and Alumnus Douglas T. Hickey ’77 to Deliver 2016 Commencement Address
Ambassador and Alumnus Douglas T. Hickey ’77 to Deliver 2016 Commencement Address




							Thursday, March 31, 2016
						




						Douglas T. Hickey ’77 with United States Secretary of State, John Kerry.
					



	Ambassador Douglas T. Hickey ’77, Commissioner General of the USA Pavilion at Expo Milano 2015, will receive an honorary degree and address this year’s graduates during Siena’s Commencement ceremonies on Sunday, May 15 at 10 a.m. at the Times Union Center in downtown Albany. 

	As Commissioner General of the United States’ delegation for the most recent World’s Fair, Hickey oversaw the development of a dynamic exhibit that showcased America’s food story and sparked a global conversation about the challenges of feeding the planet.

	Prior to his appointment in Italy, Hickey served as President and CEO of San Francisco-based BinWise Inc., the leading provider of analytics to premier restaurant, hotel and entertainment groups around the world. He previously worked as Managing Partner of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, one of Silicon Valley’s leading venture capital firms, for more than 10 years. Prior to Hummer Winblad, Hickey was CEO of Critical Path, the leading provider of messaging services to corporations around the globe.

	Hickey served as President and CEO of Global Center, which became one of the first and largest providers of advanced web hosting and content distribution on the Internet. After selling Global Center to Frontier Communications in 1998, he was named president of Frontier Global Center and Executive Vice President of Frontier Communications Corporation. Ultimately, the combined operation was successfully sold to Global Crossing.

	His work in the public sector included serving as Northern California’s Finance Co-Chair on Secretary Kerry’s Presidential campaign. He was also a member of the National Finance Committee for President Obama’s campaign in 2008 and 2012, as well as Co-Chair of the California Finance Committee.

	Hickey has carried Siena’s Franciscan values and teachings with him throughout his life, working tirelessly on behalf of the poor in the Catholic Diocese of San Francisco.

	Recognized as a “Builder of Siena,” Hickey became one of the principal donors to the College’s Values and Visions Capital Campaign in 2000 by creating the Douglas T. Hickey ‘77 Chair in Business. His philanthropy to Siena includes making the lead gift to the Douglas T. Hickey ’77 Technology Center, home of the Will Raub Trading Room. He received his bachelor’s degree in economics from Siena in 1977 and is currently on the boards of Siena, BinWise, and Plug Power Inc. (NSDQ PLUG).

	In recognition of his lifetime of exemplary exemplary achievement, leadership, and service in the public, private, and non-profit sectors of our society, Siena will present Hickey the honorary degree, Doctor of Humanities.
