 Educational Background



Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.                




PhD in Theoretical & Applied Mechanics 


Northwestern University

                  Northwestern University is a private institution founded in 1851 to serve the Northwest Territory, an area that now includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota.

In 1853, the founders purchased a 379-acre tract of land on the shore of Lake Michigan 12 miles north of Chicago. They established a campus and developed the land near it, naming the surrounding town Evanston in honor of one of the University's founders, John Evans. After completing its first building in 1855, Northwestern began classes that fall with two faculty members and 10 students.

Sixteen presidents have presided over Northwestern in the years since. The University has grown to include 12 schools and colleges, with additional campuses in Chicago and Education City in Qatar.

 Career History



Vice President-Business Development

                                    Tenure Unconfirmed                


Kemet Corp.


                  KEMET Corp. engages in the manufacturing of capacitors. The company's product offerings include tantalum, multilayer ceramic, solid and electrolytic aluminum and film and paper capacitors. It manufactures a broad line of capacitors in many different sizes and configurations using a variety of raw materials. The company operates its business through two segments: Solid Capacitors, and Film and Electrolytic. The Solid Capacitors segment products are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits, and the same circuit may, and frequently does, contain both ceramic and tantalum capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are a popular choice because of their ability for high capacitance in a small volume package. While ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values while solid aluminum capacitors can be more effective in special applications. Film, paper, and aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used to support integrated circuits, but also are used in the field of power electronics to provide energy for applications such as motor starts, power conditioning, electromagnetic interference filtering safety and inverters. Capacitors account for the largest market within the passive component product grouping. The Film and Electrolytic segment produces film, paper, and electrolytic capacitors. This segment operates manufacturing sites throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico and the United States and maintains a product innovation center in Sweden. The company was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Simpsonville, SC.
