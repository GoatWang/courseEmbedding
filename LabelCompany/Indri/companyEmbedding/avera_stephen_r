Stephen R. Avera Elected Senior Vice President of Flowers Foods

THOMASVILLE, Ga., Sep 8, 2004 (PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX) -- Flowers Foods today announced Stephen R. Avera, secretary and general counsel, has been elected to the additional position of senior vice president.

As senior vice president, secretary and general counsel, Avera will continue to be responsible for all the legal affairs of Flowers Foods. In addition, he has taken on responsibility for the company's governmental affairs.

Commenting on Avera's election, George E. Deese, Flowers Foods' president and chief executive officer, said, "This election reflects the importance of Steve's continued contribution to our company. He is a valuable member of our management team and provides our company with experienced and sound guidance."

Avera joined Flowers Foods' predecessor, Flowers Industries, in 1986 as an associate and assistant general counsel after a four-year legal career as a captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. In 1998, he was named vice president and general counsel of Flowers Bakeries, Flowers Foods' fresh bakery operation. In 2001, he took on the additional responsibilities of general counsel for Flowers' frozen and specialty operation. He was elected secretary and general counsel and an officer of Flowers Foods in 2002.

Avera serves as chairman of the American Bakers Association's political action committee and as co-chairman of the association's legal committee.

A native of Tallahassee, Fla., Avera holds a bachelor's degree and a juris doctor degree from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. He is a member of the State Bars of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, and a member of the American Corporate Counsel Association.

Headquartered in Thomasville, Ga., Flowers Foods is one of the nation's leading producers and marketers of packaged bakery foods for retail and foodservice customers. Flowers operates 34 bakeries that produce a wide range of bakery products marketed throughout the Southeastern, Southwestern, and mid-Atlantic states via an extensive direct-store-delivery network and nationwide through other delivery systems. Among the company's top brands are Nature's Own, Cobblestone Mill, BlueBird, Mrs. Freshley's, and European Bakers. For more information, visit http://www.flowersfoods.com/ .

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
