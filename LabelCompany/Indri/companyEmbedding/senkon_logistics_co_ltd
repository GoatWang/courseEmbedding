Income statement (JPY)Year on year Senkon Logistics Co Ltd grew net income 118.68% from 67.67m to 147.98m primarily through revenue growth (14.24bn to 14.68bn). For while the costs associated with cost of goods, selling, general and administrative and debt all increased as a percentage of sales, the 3.10% growth in revenues contributed enough to still see net income improve.FT Lexicon{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{2}For more information, visit the FT LexiconLexicon on this pageExplore our toolsAlertsData archivePortfolioWorld marketsEquities screenerFunds overview
