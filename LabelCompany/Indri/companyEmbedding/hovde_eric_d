MS Research




















One of the founding objectives of the Hovde Foundation is funding research to cure Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This debilitating disease affects around 2.3 million people worldwide, with approximately 200 new cases identified weekly in the US alone.  Diagnosed with the disease in 1991, Eric Hovde was driven to join the fight against MS.  For more than 25 years, Eric Hovde has given his financial resources and his time to tackle this issue.  He has served in leadership positions on the board of directors of several MS-related organizations, including the National MS Society, MS International Federation, and The Myelin Repair Project. In partnership with the National MS Society, Eric was also instrumental in launching Fast Forward LLC, an innovative initiative by the Society to speed up treatment availability to those suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. Through the Hovde Foundation and personal contributions, Eric Hovde and Steve Hovde have donated more than $2 million to Multiple Sclerosis research, and they will keep giving until a cure is found.
The Hovde Foundation provides on-going support to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which serves as a conduit of knowledge and resources for researchers and families affected by MS. Recently, the Society received a grant from the Hovde Foundation to expand its wellness program. Details about the Society’s expanded wellness solutions can be found in the Summer 2016 Quarterly Research Update.  For additional information about the benefits that living a healthy lifestyle can have on those living with MS, please check out the latest issue of the MS Connection newsletter.

Mission & Vision




















Established in 1998, the Eric D. Hovde and Steven D. Hovde Foundation supports two central missions – finding a cure for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and helping vulnerable children and families in crisis. Over $11M in grants have been issued since inception. We dedicate our resources to funding clinical MS research, building and financing “Hovde Houses” and providing domestic grants to U.S.-based non-profits.
Multiple Sclerosis is a debilitating disease that affects around 2.3 million people worldwide, with approximately 200 new cases identified weekly in the US alone. We have an almost 20-year history of involvement with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. With on-going support to the Society’s research and outreach programs, we will keep giving until a cure is found.
Hovde Houses are homes that provide shelter, supportive services, and love to vulnerable children. They offer a safe haven from injustice, neglect, malnutrition and other forms of abuse. With average capacity of 40-50 children, each house is operated by a carefully-selected local partner with professional experience providing appropriate cultural, physical, and psychological care for children in their community. To date, there are nine Hovde Houses. There are completed homes in Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Malawi, Peru, Rwanda, and Wisconsin, USA and two new homes in progress in Kenya and Honduras. Whether getting children off the streets (Guatemala), protecting girls while their sexual abusers are brought to justice (Peru), or rehabilitating boys rescued from slavery (Ghana), Hovde Houses holistically care for children in crisis situations.






Eric Hovde talks about the history of the Hovde Foundation and his own heart for helping those in need, especially vulnerable children.”





The domestic grant program aims to address the needs of local vulnerable children and families. Our funding focuses on a non-profit’s urgent needs, bridging key gaps to augment impact, and jump-starting programmatic objectives. We believe in giving back and support our community in the areas of housing, health, community development and youth development/education.
Through these three initiatives, the Hovde Foundation realizes its vision of a world in which all children can smile, knowing that they are safe, valued, and loved.

VIDEO: Eric Hovde interviewed in Kosovo in 2001
 
History
The Eric D. Hovde and Steven D. Hovde Foundation (“The Hovde Foundation”) was founded in 1998 to support two central missions – clinical research to find a cure for Multiple Sclerosis and charitable relief for those in desperate need.  The Hovde Foundation builds and finances the “Hovde Houses”, which are homes that provide shelter, supportive services, education and love to vulnerable street children.  The Hovde Foundation has established Hovde Houses in Mexico City; Huanuco, Peru; Winneba, Ghana; Kigali, Rwanda; and Mombasa, Kenya.  The Hovde Foundation has also funded a homeless shelter for children and their parents complete with case work managers and job training, in Madison, Wisconsin.
Eric Hovde’s extensive travels in developing countries alerted him to a population, indeed the most vulnerable, in desperate need of assistance: homeless children. While in Romania after the fall of communism, Eric witnessed firsthand the deplorable living conditions that thousands of young children were forced to face, as their state-run orphanages were shuttered.  This experience led Eric to conceive of the ‘Hovde House’ concept, and to connect initially with World Vision as a potential partner. With World Vision, Eric and Steve visited its programs in several countries, and along with teams of Hovde employees contributed many hours of volunteer labor, for example on the rebuilding efforts in Kosovo in 2001.
After considerable research and with the guidance of World Vision, in 2006 Eric selected Mexico City as the site of the first Hovde House, a home that would go on to provide housing, supportive services, and love to more than 200 homeless children.
Currently, the Hovde Foundation supports six Hovde Houses: one in Madison, WI, two in Latin America and three in Africa.
Our goal is to have twenty Hovde Houses over the next twenty years, adhering to the following criteria and philosophies:
Site/Partner Selection: For our international Hovde Houses, we carefully select countries that are open to foreign involvement, not hostile toward Americans, and where rule of law, children’s rights, and property rights are respected and enforceable. Critically important in project selection is identifying an appropriate local operating partner organization with ample experience working with vulnerable children and a business-minded focus on long-term sustainability.
Sustainability: Our preferred project model, similar to the Ronald McDonald House concept, is to finance the construction or acquisition of a suitable home and retain title to the land and building. We team up with an established local partner who is responsible for operations of each Hovde House. We cover all operational costs of the home through its first 2-3 years and then decrease funding as the local organization becomes more self-sustainable, often through other fundraising and development of revenue generating businesses. At such time as the local partner becomes self-sufficient, and assuming dutiful fulfillment of its role and responsibilities, we will transfer ownership of the land and building to the partner organization at no cost.
Social Impact Investing: We consider ourselves social impact investors — not just donors. Taking a seat on the board of each partner organization, we often assume a leadership role and assist with fundraising, networking, and operational support. Depending on the partner’s strengths and experience, we help with project design, development and implementation through construction. Additionally, we will allocate resources to the development of local for-profit businesses geared to fund the long-term operations of each Hovde House. We strongly believe in the intersection of philanthropy and business, and that true sustainability for non-profits comes through for-profit enterprises.

Value Added: A Chat With Eric Hovde





Most Fridays I walk from my office over to the The Palm restaurant a few blocks away, where I reward myself with a nice lunch. It's something I started 10 years ago to help me get through the week. People usually oohh and aahh when I tell them I am a regular at The Palm, but I will share a little secret: you can lunch at the bar for less than $25, and hear a great joke from host Tommy Jacomo.
Anyway, I take the same route to The Palm each week, which takes me by the offices of Eric Hovde, who works across the street in a townhouse, where his various financial businesses are located. Eric heads up Hovde Capital, Hovde Financial and Hovde Acquisitions, and has offices across the country, including Palm Beach, Los Angeles and Dallas. There's a bunch of technical terms I could ascribe to what he does, but simply put, Eric runs a hedge fund that invests in bank stocks and financial services companies.
At 43, he also runs a foundation and started a home for street children in Mexico City. I called him last week to interview him about the recent travails in the financial services market. After we got talking, I asked him if he wouldn't mind if I asked him some questions for Value Added.

Eric Hovde

Q Have bank shares have bottomed out? Or will there be more write offs? Where are we in the cycle?
A. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that bank shares will continue to decline--and potentially meaningfully--over the next six to nine months. It typically takes 36 months before you reach the bottom of a credit cycle and, given that it started in the third quarter of 2006, I do not foresee credit trends flat lining until late 2009. There will be more write-offs tied to housing now that housing prices are collapsing and we are at the beginning of credit deterioration in many other areas such as consumer, corporate and commercial real estate loans.

How is Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doing?
Fortunately, better than Greenspan who laid the groundwork for two enormous bubbles and did not exercise his regulatory oversight responsibilities. Bernanke has shown the ability to be creative by using other tools than just the fed funds rate. However, he needs to take a far more aggressive approach with Wall Street and the large investment banks in shoring up their balance sheets and reducing their risk to the economy.

How does this downturn compare to the banking-real estate downturn in the early 1990s?
Some striking similarities, yet some great differences. The similarities of both downturns are causing significant devastation to banks' balance sheets and their capital levels and will ultimately cost the taxpayers a lot of money. The differences are that, in the late 1980s/early 1990s, it was commercial real estate that collapsed, causing repercussions to housing and other industries. This time around, it is the residential market which is much more important and a bigger asset class than commercial real estate. Another difference is that the Fed is being much more aggressive early on in the process.

Was it right/fair for the Fed to bail out Bear Stearns? 
 I understand the Fed's concern in not allowing Bear Stearns to collapse. However, I have a fundamental problem with how they handled the bailout. To have allowed shareholders to have received any money when the taxpayers are going to absorb several billion dollars in losses and further to allow J.P. Morgan to renegotiate the price to $10 per share that, in turn, allowed Bear's Chairman, Jimmy Cayne, to sell $61 million in stock, was fundamentally wrong. When 1,300 banks and thrifts failed in the late 1980s/early 1990s, shareholders received nothing, and management teams were immediately terminated and in many cases prosecuted. They are allowing the wrong risk/reward parameters to continue on Wall Street.

Tell us some of your favorite investments. Where is Hovde hedge fund money invested these days?
We have been long gold because in the Fed's attempt to save the economy they are destroying the dollar. There are insurance companies and banks that are in certain product types and/or in geographic market areas which face substantially less risks. However, most of our returns have been generated by being short a variety of different financial stocks, particularly those that are substantially levered to housing.

Where was your last vacation? Last book read?
Last vacation: Half Moon Bay in Jamaica, my family's favorite resort in the Caribbean. Last book read: "Next," a Michael Crichton book about genetics.

What is your favorite Washington sports team? Do you have season tickets?
I was born in Wisconsin so I am a die-hard Green Bay fan. However, the Wizards are my favorite DC team.

What is your ringtone? Do you carry a Blackberry?
My ringtone is normal/the standard and, yes, I carry a "Crackberry"--it is a necessary evil.
What Washington area businesspeople do you admire?
Bill Marriott--he has built a very impressive company and yet has done it in a moral and ethical way.
What is your biggest indulgence?
Great adventure trips around the world. The first time I went to the Amazon, I went to Angel Falls in southeastern Venezuela, which is the highest waterfall in the world. It is in the jungle where we had to take a very small plane to a base camp and then take a small motorized canoe up river for a day to another base camp and then hike to the falls which were spectacular. I have not climbed Everest but have hiked in the Himalayas in Bhutan, the last kingdom in Asia. My favorite climb, though, was Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

This is a great blog, especially the most recent piece on Eric Hovde. His surprisingly candid comments on Greenspan are a breath of fresh air -- too many people ignore the problems that guy caused while at the Fed. Problems that Bernanke is trying to clean up after. 

Posted by: Walter JC Mitty | April 22, 2008  5:29 PM 
			


Pithy comments from Eric Hovde - especially with regard to Alan Greenspan and on the Bear Stearns buyout.  Fed must be careful how it 'midwifes these shotgun buyouts" (How's that for mixing up the metaphors?) - but Hovde ignores one HUGE difference - in the S&L crisis, stockholders got nothing because the firm's current worth went negative in all the cases I know about, while Bear Stearns stock never got even close to the $2.00 per share figure.  Don't know if $10/share is fair, but Jamie Dimon evidently thought so, and he is the one accountable to JPM stockholders and their board.

The above in no way excuses Jimmy Cayne.  Were I a Bear stockholder, I would be busy organizing a demand that Cayne be sued to recover damages for misleading employees, regulators, and the public with statements he knew - or should have known - were false.  But, that is an issue separate from the question of whether stockholders of a troubled financial institution should lose their entire investment in a buyout - what they get should depend upon the residual value of the firm to the buyer.

Hovde is right about 36 months being the historic downslope, and may be right about 36 months this time.  But don't bet on it.  Took Japan a decade to dig out from under their real estate bubble debris.  And, I suspect the only thing that will shorten the current downslope is the upslope of another bubble.  So, what I am looking for is the NEXT bubble.

Kudos to the Post for this new feature.  The "company town" nature of Washington leads to an obsessive focus on politics.  
This blog sheds light on the many other people working productively in the nation's capital who are not involved in politics. 
It's refreshing to hear candid assessments about government decision making from someone who has neither an ax to grind nor a vested interest. 
Keep it up.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Declared[edit]

Jeff Fitzgerald, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly[18]
Eric Hovde, businessman[19]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Jeff Fitzgerald, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly[18]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Jeff Fitzgerald, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly[18]
Eric Hovde, businessman[19]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]

The 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin took place on November 6, 2012, alongside a U.S. presidential election as well as other elections to the United States Senate and House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl retired instead of running for re-election to a fifth term.
Primary elections were held on August 14, 2012. Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district ran unopposed for her party's nomination. The Republican nominee was former Governor of Wisconsin and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, who won with a plurality in a four-way race. In the general election, Baldwin defeated Thompson and won the open seat. She became the first woman elected to represent Wisconsin in the Senate and the first openly gay U.S. Senator in history. This is also the first time Thompson lost a statewide race.

Background[edit]
Incumbent Democratic Senator Herb Kohl was re-elected to a fourth term in 2006, beating Republican attorney Robert Lorge by 67% to 30%. Kohl's lack of fundraising suggested his potential retirement.[2] There was speculation that Kohl might decide to retire so as to allow Russ Feingold, who lost his re-election bid in 2010, to run again, although Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, dismissed speculation about Kohl's potential retirement.[3] Ultimately, Kohl announced in May 2011 that he would not run for re-election in 2012.
Democratic primary[edit]
Despite speculation that Kohl would retire to make way for his former Senate colleague Russ Feingold, Feingold did not enter the race. Other politicians thought to be likely candidates also declined to run, so Baldwin was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Results of the 2012 Wisconsin Republican Senatorial Primary with winner indicated by county.


Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had stated he would not run against Kohl if Kohl sought reelection, but would contemplate a run if Kohl retired.[15] Ryan later stated that he was "95 percent sure" that he would not run.[16]
Six candidates declared for the seat, although two later withdrew. The contest turned out to be a four-way fight and although a large majority of Republican primary voters consistently expressed a preference for a nominee "more conservative" than Tommy Thompson, Eric Hovde and Mark Neumann split the conservative vote and Thompson narrowly prevailed with a plurality of the vote.[17]

Declared[edit]

Jeff Fitzgerald, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly[18]
Eric Hovde, businessman[19]
Mark Neumann, former U.S. Representative and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1998[20][21]

Aftermath[edit]
Brian Schimming, the Vice Chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, partly blamed Thompson's defeat on the fact that he had to face a competitive primary whereas Baldwin was unopposed for the Democratic nomination: "[Thompson] blew all his money going through the primary. So when he gets through the primary, it was like three weeks before he was up on the air. [Baldwin] piled on immediately." He claimed "If [Thompson] hadn't had as ugly a primary, we could have won that seat."[63]
