History[edit]
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.[3] The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed.[4]
L3 continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors.[5]

Management[edit]
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheen Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named President and COO, with Strianese remaining as Chairman and CEO.[18] On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman.[19]
Naming[edit]
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated "L3" in informal industry communication.
On December 31, 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company's website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company's NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.[20]
Products[edit]

L-3 ProVision, Millimeter Wave Airport Passenger Screening System
L-3 eXaminer SX, 3DX, and XLB, Airport baggage scanning systems
L-3 OptEX, Trace level explosive detection system
AVCATT, a mobile aviation training simulator
Orchid,[21] Total Development & Simulation Environment (Power, Marine)
EOTech, Holographic weapon sights
L-3 Sonoma EO, Electro Optical Imaging Systems, 1508M Dragon Eyes, 1205MD, 2111X, 2514X, & 2711G

Controversies[edit]
Federal contract suspension[edit]
In 2010 it was announced that L3's Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, "used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use." A US federal criminal investigation[22] ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.
Counterfeit parts[edit]
On November 4, 2010 L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.[23]
EOTech Defective Holographic Sights Lawsuit[edit]
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.[24]
The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect in March 2015 and presented EOTech with "the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to DoD." According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.[25]
In temperature extremes the sights exhibited thermal drift, which is when the sight's point of aim differed from its point of impact.[24]|
John Bailey, director of marketing at EOtech said,

Thermal drift is basically when you go from ambient temperature to temperature extreme there is going to be a point of impact shift...We have realized that our sight could shift … in those extremes, -40 and 122 Fahrenheit.
— John Bailey, "EOTech Breaks Silence over Defective Sights" military.com

The sights also suffered from reticle fading and parallax.

History[edit]
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.[3] The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed.[4]
L3 continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors.[5]

Management[edit]
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheen Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named President and COO, with Strianese remaining as Chairman and CEO.[18] On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman.[19]
Naming[edit]
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated "L3" in informal industry communication.
On December 31, 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company's website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company's NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.[20]
Products[edit]

L-3 ProVision, Millimeter Wave Airport Passenger Screening System
L-3 eXaminer SX, 3DX, and XLB, Airport baggage scanning systems
L-3 OptEX, Trace level explosive detection system
AVCATT, a mobile aviation training simulator
Orchid,[21] Total Development & Simulation Environment (Power, Marine)
EOTech, Holographic weapon sights
L-3 Sonoma EO, Electro Optical Imaging Systems, 1508M Dragon Eyes, 1205MD, 2111X, 2514X, & 2711G

Controversies[edit]
Federal contract suspension[edit]
In 2010 it was announced that L3's Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, "used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use." A US federal criminal investigation[22] ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.
Counterfeit parts[edit]
On November 4, 2010 L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.[23]
EOTech Defective Holographic Sights Lawsuit[edit]
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.[24]
The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect in March 2015 and presented EOTech with "the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to DoD." According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.[25]
In temperature extremes the sights exhibited thermal drift, which is when the sight's point of aim differed from its point of impact.[24]|
John Bailey, director of marketing at EOtech said,

Thermal drift is basically when you go from ambient temperature to temperature extreme there is going to be a point of impact shift...We have realized that our sight could shift … in those extremes, -40 and 122 Fahrenheit.
— John Bailey, "EOTech Breaks Silence over Defective Sights" military.com

The sights also suffered from reticle fading and parallax.

History[edit]
L3 was formed as L-3 Communications in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993.[3] The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed.[4]
L3 continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors.[5]

Management[edit]
Frank Lanza, CEO and co-founder, died on June 7, 2006. CFO Michael T. Strianese was named as interim CEO, and was later appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company on October 23, 2006. In 2015, former Lockheen Martin executive Christopher E. Kubasik was named President and COO, with Strianese remaining as Chairman and CEO.[18] On July 19, 2017, Strianese announced that he would retire as CEO on December 31, 2017, to be succeeded by Kubasik, but would remain as board chairman.[19]
Naming[edit]
L3 Technologies was originally named L-3 Communications for the last initials of its founders Frank Lanza, Robert LaPenta, and Lehman Brothers. Despite the similarity in naming, there is no corporate connection between L3 Technologies, formerly known as L-3 Communications, and networking provider Level 3 Communications, whose name is often abbreviated "L3" in informal industry communication.
On December 31, 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. The company's website changed from L-3com.com to L3T.com, but the company's NYSE ticker symbol of LLL remained the same.[20]
Products[edit]

L-3 ProVision, Millimeter Wave Airport Passenger Screening System
L-3 eXaminer SX, 3DX, and XLB, Airport baggage scanning systems
L-3 OptEX, Trace level explosive detection system
AVCATT, a mobile aviation training simulator

EOTech, Holographic weapon sights
L-3 Sonoma EO, Electro Optical Imaging Systems, 1508M Dragon Eyes, 1205MD, 2111X, 2514X, & 2711G

Controversies[edit]
Federal contract suspension[edit]
In 2010 it was announced that L3's Special Support Programs Division had been suspended by the United States Air Force from doing any contract work for the US federal government. A US Department of Defense investigation had reportedly found that the company had, "used a highly sensitive government computer network to collect competitive business information for its own use." A US federal criminal investigation[22] ended the temporary suspension on July 27, 2010.
Counterfeit parts[edit]
On November 4, 2010 L3 issued a part purge notification to prevent future use of Chinese counterfeit parts, but did not notify its customers whose display systems suffered from much higher than expected failure rates.[23]
EOTech Defective Holographic Sights Lawsuit[edit]
In 2015, L3 Technologies agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Government. L3 was accused of knowingly providing the U.S. military with optics that failed in extreme temperatures and humid weather conditions. These sights were provided to infantry and special operations forces operating in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as civilians and law enforcement.[24]
The civil fraud lawsuit was filed by Preet Bharara, in the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged L3 officials have known since 2006 that the holographic sights being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan failed to perform as advertised in extreme temperature ranges. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI independently discovered the thermal drift defect in March 2015 and presented EOTech with "the very same findings that the company had documented internally for years. Shortly thereafter, EOTech finally disclosed the thermal drift defect to DoD." According to court documents, EOTech had advertised that its sights performed in temperatures ranging from -40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and in humid conditions.[25]
In temperature extremes the sights exhibited thermal drift, which is when the sight's point of aim differed from its point of impact.[24]|
John Bailey, director of marketing at EOtech said,

Thermal drift is basically when you go from ambient temperature to temperature extreme there is going to be a point of impact shift...We have realized that our sight could shift … in those extremes, -40 and 122 Fahrenheit.
— John Bailey, "EOTech Breaks Silence over Defective Sights" military.com

The sights also suffered from reticle fading and parallax.

Major defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report)	 has acquired UK-based CTC Aviation Group in a deal worth $220 million (£143 million) in cash. The acquisition aims at enhancing its commercial aviation training operations and strengthening its international presence.CTC Aviation has been renamed L-3 CTC Ltd. and integrated into the company’s Electronic Systems segment.L-3 CTC Aviation has a worldwide reputation in providing specialized and innovative solutions related to pilot training and crew resourcing services to major airlines and retail customers. Its integration into L-3’s Commercial Aviation Training business, which already includes L-3 Link UK, ­ a world-class provider of flight-training simulation devices, will strengthen L-3 Communications’ foothold as a leading provider of flight training and simulation services.L-3 CTC expects sales of $86 million in 2015 and $95 million in 2016. Being a high-margin business, it has the potential to generate operating margins more than that of the entire Electronic Systems segment. Hence, the acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it strengthens its training solutions across a wide range of military and commercial platforms. The company expects L-3 CTC to add approximately $50 million to its total sales this year.Given that L-3 Communications’ business is primarily driven by contracts from the U.S. government, a tepid defense budget scenario has compelled it to expand and consolidate its international presence. A steady flow of foreign contracts will thus help to counter the sequestration impact at home.Recently, the company posted weak first-quarter results with earnings falling 24.7% year over year hurt by a sales decline in each of its four segments. The company also lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for 2015. Although growth slowed down in the first quarter, its strategy of gradually expanding its commercial and international operations has partially offset some of the domestic decline.The company’s international and commercial sales represented about 30% of its consolidated net sales in the first-quarter 2015, up from 29% in first-quarter 2014. Moreover, the company has expanded its international sales by 35% since 2011 and expects international and commercial sales to make up for 32% of consolidated 2015 sales.L-3 Communications is one of the best-positioned, pure defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus and broad diversification of programs. Its timeliness and contributions from strategic acquisitions will sustain its financial performance, going forward. L-3 Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the defense space include API Technologies Corp. , Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report)	 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)	, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        'By bringing together these two world-class performers, L-3 now offers a seamless, one-stop shop that provides customized and affordable solutions to support the global commercial aviation training marketplace,' said Steve Kantor, president of L-3 Electronic Systems. 'Given the global pilot shortage and the growing need for pilot training at all proficiency levels, we are now optimally positioned to serve this market with our technical expertise and leading innovative products and capabilities, which will help us capture key synergies, grow our customer base, and expand our product and service portfolio.'
      

        This singular division has been specifically created to meet current and emerging market requirements and drive continued efficiencies. It has a global offering that spans the complete spectrum of Commercial Aviation Training, with services that encompass selection, cadet (ab initio) training, resourcing and airline training (including recurrent, type rating and command training) - all supported by high-technology simulation products such as the RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.
      

        CTC Aviation and Link UK have been collaborating since the acquisition of CTC Aviation by L-3 in May 2015. This dynamic team effort resulted in the successful establishment of a training facility at London's Gatwick Airport (U.K.) that houses L-3 RealitySeven training devices for both Boeing and Airbus aircraft to support a variety of customers. It also yielded a highly successful partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to provide a B787 training and instructional capability (via CTC Aviation instructors) on a Link UK B787 RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.
      

        As a part of this consolidation, the existing training portfolio of Link UK has been aligned with CTC Aviation's airline training business. This includes the company's leading training facility in Bangkok- the Asian Aviation Training Centre (AATC) - which has recently expanded from six to eight full flight simulators.
      

        Alan Crawford, president of L-3 Commercial Training Solutions, said, 'L-3 Commercial Training Solutions offers a comprehensive, value-added portfolio to deliver uniquely targeted solutions that meet our customers' total scope of training, resourcing and simulation needs. We are committed to building on the strengths that will continue to support our customers in the future. Our agility, our drive to innovate and our firm belief in developing ongoing partnerships will enable us to consistently exceed expectations.'
      

        L-3 Commercial Training Solutions is located in Crawley, U.K., and includes L-3 Link UK, L-3 CTC Aviation and L-3 CTC Private Jet. It is a world leader in providing intelligent total training solutions for pilots and maintainers across a wide range of commercial platforms. L-3 Commercial Training Solutions provides a full spectrum of state-of-the-art training solutions, including ab initio training, airline training, training centers and high-fidelity simulation products. The company has delivered commercial training solutions to customer locations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim.
      

        Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 38,000 people worldwide and is a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. L-3 is also a prime contractor in aerospace systems. The company reported 2015 sales of $10.5 billion.

About L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

L3 Technologies (formerly L-3 Communications Holdings) provides products and services to the government based on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), including systems for satellite, avionics (aircraft electronics), and marine communications. Products include simulation, training, and night vision equipment, and L3 also provides aircraft maintenance and modernization services. The US government, primarily the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DoD), accounts for nearly 70% of its business, but L3 is expanding its commercial offerings. The company operates through 273 locations around the globe, but the majority of its revenues stem from the US.
  
Operations
L3 operates through four main segments: Electronic Systems, Sensor Systems, Communication Systems, and Aerospace Systems. 
Geographic Reach

   The company operates through 273 locations consisting of manufacturing facilities, administration, research and development and other properties throughout the US and internationally. The US is its largest market, accounting for roughly 80% of total revenue in 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company's sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the US government. In 2016, the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DOD) and other government agencies accounted for 73% of its total revenue; the remainder of revenue was contributed by commercial (12%) and foreign governments (15%).

In addition, direct sales to end customers represented 67% of net sales in 2016, and sales acting as a subcontractor or supplier represented the remaining 33%. Sales to L3's five largest contracts generated 15% of total sales; its largest contract was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the US Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM).
Financial Performance

   L3 has seen its net sales slowly diminish over the last five years. In addition, revenues remained static for 2015 and 2016, hovering around the $10.5 billion mark for both years. During 2016, L3 experienced significant sales declines in South Korea (39%), Australia (21%), Saudi Arabia (21%), and Japan (15%). These regions were affected by lower sales related to linguist services, training, and logistics support projects for the
   
    US Army
   
   due to the draw-down of American military forces in Iraq.
  
L3 posted a net loss of $240 million in 2015. The loss was attributed to the selling of its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business in early 2016 and led to the incurring of impairment charges and a loss from discontinued operations for 2015.
 With this divestiture behind it, L3 posted positive net income of $710 million in 2016. 
Strategy

   With such a major amount of business derived from the US government and DoD (the US Army and
   
    Air Force
   
   collectively account for about 70% of its total revenue), the company is vulnerable to the priorities of the Pentagon and other government agencies, which have resulted in cuts in defense spending and additional troop withdrawals from the Middle East.
  

   In addition, the company enters into collaborative ventures with other businesses to develop new opportunities, especially in the area of providing full-service, rather than just products. Additionally, L3 has been transitioning from providing individual products and components to bundled products and services, including logistics, MRO (maintenance, repair, and overall), and supply chain management. Its revenues from services is now neck-and-neck with that of its products, and L3 plans to add additional services under existing programs.
  

   To focus on this strategy, in early 2016 L3 sold its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business to
   
    CACI International
   
   for $550 million.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions
In early 2017, L3 acquired the explosives trace detection (ETD) business of Massachusetts-based Implant Sciences Corporation for $118 million in cash. L3 will integrate Implant into its security and detection systems division within its electronic systems business segment. The transaction enhanced its capabilities within the global aviation security and national security markets and allowed it to capitalize on significant opportunities in the growing security and detection market.
In 2016, the company obtained Micreo Limited, located in Brisbane, Australia. Micreo is a market leader in the design and production of RF and photonic products for radar and electronic warfare, and its products are currently installed in several of the world’s frontline military aircraft and ships. The deal complemented the company’s electronic warfare capabilities and expanded its Australian footprint.

   In 2015, L3 snapped up UK-headquartered CTC Aviation Group (now known as L-3 CTC Ltd) for $220 million. L-3 CTC is a global airline pilot training and crew resourcing specialist catering to major airlines and retail customers globally. The acquisition expanded L3's commercial aviation training business.

L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL) Absorbs U.K. Commercial Pilot Trainer CTC Aviation

On Thursday, L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL) announced that it had entered into a contract to acquire CTC Aviation Group.
The defense company said that the deal to acquire the commercial pilot trainer was worth $220 million. The newly acquired firm is now known as L-3 CTC Ltd. L-3 claims that they expect immediate results to start pouring in. The company anticipates sales gains in upwards of $50 million from the new acquisition by the end of the year.
Analysts estimate that L-3 to make $11.6 billion in total revenue for 2015. L-3 CTC specializes in pilot and crew training. The company operates on a global scale and provides its services to retail clients and major airline companies.
L-3’s Chief Executive Officer, Michael Strianese described the procurement as a decent fit for the company to push its expansion strategies as it looks to improve its the international presence. He also added that the firm has to consider higher scale businesses to make sure it improves its profitability.
Since 2010, the company’s international scene and profitability margins have gone up by 30%, an improvement from a previous low of 20%. L-3 has been competing for contracts with the government. The company continues to receive more recognition and does not plan to stop there.
L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL)’s new acquisition is a strategic plan that the company hopes will go a long way in pushing their goal to expand their operations in the global scene. It is an investment decision that seems to have been carefully thought through. The firm has received a lot of recognition from its past acquisition decisions. L-3 recently announced that it would consider letting go of its marine systems venture that has not been performing as per expectations.
The Marine Systems trade is one of the sections of the firm’s commercial and international divisions. Abandoning it will not only reduce the costs but will also give the company more room to venture into other potentially lucrative ideas. This will allow the firm to make a solid stand. It will also add up as one of the measures that will necessitate progress and the achievement of company goals.
