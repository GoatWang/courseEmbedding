Executive malfeasance[edit]
Insider trading by CP All executives occurred in 2013, according to a statement by Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 2 December 2015. Korsak Chairasmisak, the vice chairman of CP All, at that time was its CEO. He bought over 118,000 shares of Siam Makro, a cash-and-carry chain, over a 12-day period ending on 22 April 2013. The following day, CP All announced a tender offer for Siam Makro shares at 15 percent above the 22 April close. The regulator found that Korsak had prior knowledge of the deal and imposed a fine of over 30 million baht (US$833,000). Three executives also involved were fined 3.1 million baht.[7] No criminal charges were brought. CP All's audit committee said they had decided it was 'appropriate for the individuals to continue' their employment. As justification, the statement cited their prior behavior and performance and their "exceptional skills and experience, which would be difficult to replace".[8]

Executive malfeasance[edit]
Insider trading by CP All executives occurred in 2013, according to a statement by Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 2 December 2015. Korsak Chairasmisak, the vice chairman of CP All, at that time was its CEO. He bought over 118,000 shares of Siam Makro, a cash-and-carry chain, over a 12-day period ending on 22 April 2013. The following day, CP All announced a tender offer for Siam Makro shares at 15 percent above the 22 April close. The regulator found that Korsak had prior knowledge of the deal and imposed a fine of over 30 million baht (US$833,000). Three executives also involved were fined 3.1 million baht.[7] No criminal charges were brought. CP All's audit committee said they had decided it was 'appropriate for the individuals to continue' their employment. As justification, the statement cited their prior behavior and performance and their "exceptional skills and experience, which would be difficult to replace".[8]
