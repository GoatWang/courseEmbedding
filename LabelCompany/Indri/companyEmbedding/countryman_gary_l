SPACE & STORAGE










THE MOST SPACIOUS MINI EVER.	
Our largest and roomiest model yet, the new Countryman comfortably seats five in a richly tailored interior with generous cargo space.

See how the new Countryman measures up against the Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLA250.

SPACE TO DISCOVER. 
Unprecedented spaciousness and versatility come together in an interior full of thoughtfully designed packing solutions and refined passenger comforts—like 40/20/40 split rear seats that fold down individually, an optional foldable cargo floor, and even a foldable Picnic Cushion option that transforms the rear bumper into a cushioned seat.










WELL-EQUIPPED IS STANDARD. 
With an explorer’s attitude and more premium technology and design features as standard than ever before, the new Countryman comes readily outfitted for any adventure.

This expansive dual-pane sunroof extends to the back seat, so everyone can let in the great outdoors and enjoy the fresh air.

COMFORT ACCESS

Leave the keys in your pocket with our keyless entry feature. Comfort Access adds a transceiver to your key that your MINI will recognize, letting you lock or unlock the car by pushing a button on the door handle. 











HEATED MIRRORS
STANDARD
Heated side-view and rear-view mirrors maximize visibility in icy and frosty conditions, while heated washer jets help defrost the windshield. 
















RAIN-SENSING WIPERS
STANDARD
Should you encounter any inclement weather on your journey, the windshield wipers and headlights will turn on automatically, so you can venture on with confidence.













REAR PARK DISTANCE CONTROL
STANDARD
Working in unison with the Rear View Camera, this ultrasonic sensor makes parallel parking even easier, alerting you with a beeping sound if you get too close to another vehicle or object as you back up.












SPLIT-FOLDING REAR SEATS
STANDARD
With sliding and reclining rear seats that fold down individually, you can customize the seating arrangement to accommodate more cargo without sacrificing passenger comfort.












More Features

Complementing the Countryman's muscular stance and higher seating position, the available ALL4 option is one of the foremost all-wheel drive systems in its class, providing superior all-weather capability and traction on all surfaces, from slick city streets to rugged country roads. And even if road conditions are pristine, the optimal tracking stability of the ALL4 system delivers unmatched control for tackling sharp turns with ease.

BE IN THE KNOW
BECOME AN INSIDER



















Eight-Speed Automatic
Standard on the Cooper S and available as an option on the Cooper S Countryman ALL4, this rare 8-speed transmission allows for especially smooth and precise shifting, while Steptronic lets you to choose between the convenience of automatic and the thrill of manual shifting. The optional F-1 style, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters let you maximize your Motoring performance with a fluid flick of your finger.

















Three Driving Modes
The new Countryman blends an intrepid spirit and a firm, European road feel from the moment you start the engine. But with our standard adjustable Driving Mode system, you can direct the technically sophisticated drivetrain to match your Motoring mood. Sport Mode will tighten your steering and adjust the throttle profile for a more aggressive, thrilling drive. For more fuel-efficient motoring, switch to Green Mode with optimized fuel delivery, tweaked shift points and a coasting feature that disengages an automatic transmission when your foot’s off the gas.

















OPTIONAL MINI CONNECTED 5.0
This powerful center console features a high-resolution 8.8” touchscreen display that seamlessly integrates the full suite of MINI Connected technology into a single intuitive interface – from turn-by-turn satellite navigation with real-time traffic updates to hands-free communication with Bluetooth, key motoring data, and entertainment with apps like Spotify®, Pandora® and more. (iPhone support available now, Android coming soon.)

















Eight Dual-Stage Airbags
By monitoring impact severity and adjusting inflation rates accordingly, our airbag system will gently cushion you with as much force as needed. And in extreme cases, they’ll stay inflated longer to keep you safe from shattered glass.
















Adaptive Cruise Control
With precise engine and braking control, our Adaptive Cruise Control helps your MINI maintain a consistent speed. Adaptive Cruise Control will even use video to monitor and automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Of course, if you want to make any adjustments, just use your steering wheel controls to speed up or slow down.
















Dynamic Stability Control
The Dynamic Stability Control system uses sensors to measure the steering angle, yaw and lateral acceleration to determine the direction you want to go. Then, if your MINI starts to stray, the DSC system kicks in by applying corrective brake pressure to individual wheels and adjusting engine torque.
















Ultra-Rigid Body w/ Multiphase Steel Frame
The rigid body of every MINI Countryman reduces body torque, freeing the suspension to do what it does best - provide super-tight handling. A flex-free frame also reduces squeaks, rattles, vibrations and cabin noise.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
California: A married applicant may apply for a separate account. New York: Upon request you will be informed whether or not a consumer report was requested and if a report was requested, the name and address of the consumer reporting agency. Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law. Massachusetts: Massachusetts law prohibits discrimination on the basis of marital status or sexual orientation. Married Wisconsin Residents: Wisconsin law provides that no provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement or a court decree will adversely affect a creditor’s interests unless prior to the time credit is granted, the creditor is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision.
PRESCREEN & OPT-OUT NOTICE: The consumer named on this communication received the offer of credit because the consumer satisfied the criteria for creditworthiness under which the consumer was selected for the offer. If applicable, the credit may not be extended if, after the consumer responds to the offer, the consumer does not meet the criteria used to select the consumer for the offer or any applicable criteria bearing on creditworthiness or does not furnish any required collateral. You have the right to prohibit information contained in your credit file with any credit reporting agency from being used in connection with any credit or insurance transactions that you did not initiate.

SPACE & STORAGE

BE IN THE KNOW
BECOME AN INSIDER



















Eight-Speed Automatic
Standard on the Cooper S and available as an option on the Cooper S Countryman ALL4, this rare 8-speed transmission allows for especially smooth and precise shifting, while Steptronic lets you to choose between the convenience of automatic and the thrill of manual shifting. The optional F-1 style, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters let you maximize your Motoring performance with a fluid flick of your finger.

















Three Driving Modes
The new Countryman blends an intrepid spirit and a firm, European road feel from the moment you start the engine. But with our standard adjustable Driving Mode system, you can direct the technically sophisticated drivetrain to match your Motoring mood. Sport Mode will tighten your steering and adjust the throttle profile for a more aggressive, thrilling drive. For more fuel-efficient motoring, switch to Green Mode with optimized fuel delivery, tweaked shift points and a coasting feature that disengages an automatic transmission when your foot’s off the gas.

















OPTIONAL MINI CONNECTED 5.0
This powerful center console features a high-resolution 8.8” touchscreen display that seamlessly integrates the full suite of MINI Connected technology into a single intuitive interface – from turn-by-turn satellite navigation with real-time traffic updates to hands-free communication with Bluetooth, key motoring data, and entertainment with apps like Spotify®, Pandora® and more. (iPhone support available now, Android coming soon.)

















Eight Dual-Stage Airbags
By monitoring impact severity and adjusting inflation rates accordingly, our airbag system will gently cushion you with as much force as needed. And in extreme cases, they’ll stay inflated longer to keep you safe from shattered glass.
















Adaptive Cruise Control
With precise engine and braking control, our Adaptive Cruise Control helps your MINI maintain a consistent speed. Adaptive Cruise Control will even use video to monitor and automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Of course, if you want to make any adjustments, just use your steering wheel controls to speed up or slow down.
















Dynamic Stability Control
The Dynamic Stability Control system uses sensors to measure the steering angle, yaw and lateral acceleration to determine the direction you want to go. Then, if your MINI starts to stray, the DSC system kicks in by applying corrective brake pressure to individual wheels and adjusting engine torque.
















Ultra-Rigid Body w/ Multiphase Steel Frame
The rigid body of every MINI Countryman reduces body torque, freeing the suspension to do what it does best - provide super-tight handling. A flex-free frame also reduces squeaks, rattles, vibrations and cabin noise.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.
California: A married applicant may apply for a separate account. New York: Upon request you will be informed whether or not a consumer report was requested and if a report was requested, the name and address of the consumer reporting agency. Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally available to all creditworthy customers and that credit reporting agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with this law. Massachusetts: Massachusetts law prohibits discrimination on the basis of marital status or sexual orientation. Married Wisconsin Residents: Wisconsin law provides that no provision of any marital property agreement, unilateral statement or a court decree will adversely affect a creditor’s interests unless prior to the time credit is granted, the creditor is furnished a copy of the agreement, statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision.
PRESCREEN & OPT-OUT NOTICE: The consumer named on this communication received the offer of credit because the consumer satisfied the criteria for creditworthiness under which the consumer was selected for the offer. If applicable, the credit may not be extended if, after the consumer responds to the offer, the consumer does not meet the criteria used to select the consumer for the offer or any applicable criteria bearing on creditworthiness or does not furnish any required collateral. You have the right to prohibit information contained in your credit file with any credit reporting agency from being used in connection with any credit or insurance transactions that you did not initiate. To exercise this right, please call Experian Opt-Out at 1-888-5OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688), or write to Experian, P.O. Box 919, Allen, TX 75013.
