Donald M. Baer


 
Donald M. Baer was a Roy A. Roberts Distinguished Professor of Human Development and Family Life and of Psychology at the University of Kansas. He was born in Chicago on October 25, 1931, joined the KU faculty in 1965, and died at age 70 in 2002. Dr. Baer was an internationally renowned member of several generations of basic, applied, and developmental psychologists. He received his AB and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1950 and 1957, respectively, the latter in psychology under the supervision of Jacob L. Gewirtz (Florida International University). Between 1957 and 1965, Don established the “behavior analysis” approach to child development with Sidney W. Bijou at the University of Washington (e.g., Bijou & Baer, 1961; see also Baer, 1970, 1976), and contributed fundamentally to the experimental analysis of child behavior (e.g., Baer, 1960; Gewirtz & Baer, 1958). On the basis of then-pioneering work by Montrose M. Wolf and Todd R. Risley, he and they formally founded the discipline of applied behavior analysis at the University of Kansas in the late 1960s, where it flourished thereafter. Applied behavior analysis provides a conceptual framework and logic for empirically-based interventions into problems of individual and social importance (e.g., developmental disabilities, mental retardation, chronic aberrant behavior (see Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968, 1987). Dr. Baer published over two hundred articles, chapters, and books, and gave many more presentations.

Tel: 509-375-0217
E-mail: donald_baer@avs.org

DONALD BAER is a Laboratory Fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) where he is the Lead Scientist for Energy Materials and Processes for EMSL—the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy national scientific user facility. He received a B.S. in physics in 1969 from Carnegie-Mellon University, a Ph.D. in experimental physics in 1974 from Cornell University and was postdoc in Physics at the University of Illinois.  Baer joined PNNL as a postdoc in 1976 and among other roles he has served as group leader for interphase chemistry, deputy director of PNNL’s Nanotechnology Initiative, and co-director of the PNNL-University of Washington Joint Center for Nanotechnology.  During 1984-1985 he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Surrey, Guildford UK working with Jim Castle.  He has been an affiliate Professor of Chemistry at the University of Washington since 2004 and was an adjunct Professor of Physics for Washington State University (1990-2012). Most of his research has explored the impact of surfaces and interfaces on material properties including understanding the behaviors of nanoparticles in aqueous and biological systems, the surface chemistry and dissolution of oxides and minerals, and the role of interfacial chemistry on stress corrosion cracking leading to more than 260 peer reviewed publications.   He has specialized in adapting surface sensitive tools to address complex problems and provide quantitative information.  In support of AVS, Baer has served as Chair, Secretary, and Member of the Executive Committee of the Applied Surface Science Division, member of the Distinguished Lecturer and Recommended Practices Committees, and as member for the National Program Committee (10 times).  He co-organized the AVS Applied Surface Analysis Topical Conference in 1998 and 2004 and served on the program committee or been the local arrangement chair for many Quantitative Surface Analysis conferences. He is member of the ‘aging’ PNNL team that has, to their surprise, captured the corporate team trophy in the AVS 5K run for the past decade. He has organized symposia for a variety of other societies, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society and the Electrochemical Society.  He is the Reviews Editor for Surface and Interface Analysis, has been on the editorial board for Surface Science Spectra since 1991, and was an associate editor of JVST (1989-1992). He served on the Advisory Board of the US-Korea NanoForum (2004-2010) and the International Advisory Board for Practical Surface Analysis (2007-2013).  He has strong interest in encouraging young scientists and received the PNNL Fitzner Eberhardt Award for outstanding contributions to science education (2000) and the Chester Cooper Mentor of the Year Award for mentoring technical staff (2003). Dr. Baer is recipient of several national and international awards including the 2009 Albert Nerken Award from the AVS, the 2011 John Rivière Prize of the UK Surface Analysis Forum and the 2012 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and an Award of Merit from ASTM International (2014).  He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ASTM International and the AVS.
