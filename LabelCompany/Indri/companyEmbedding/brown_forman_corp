Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select


Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select is a super-premium, small batch bourbon that is a product of the historic Woodford Reserve Distillery, located in the heart of Kentucky’s Bluegrass Region. Woodford Reserve has quickly become a highly acclaimed, award winning bourbon which is savored by consumers worldwide. It is a bourbon of exceptional richness, depth, and character with a smooth, well-rounded finish.






Woodford Reserve Double Oaked


An innovative approach to twice-barreled bourbon creates the rich and colorful flavor of Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. Uniquely matured in separate, charred oak barrels – the second barrel deeply toasted before a light charring – extracts additional amounts of soft, sweet oak character.






Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection


In the early 1800s, our Woodford County Distillery, thanks to owner Oscar Pepper and Master Distiller James Crow, was the site for landmark discoveries and innovative techniques in bourbon-making.
Woodford Reserve’s Master Collection honors the pioneering work of Pepper and Crow, applying their handcrafted methods to a variety of grain recipes, fermentation styles and maturation processes to create a range of unique whiskeys.






Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey


Made in the traditional style of Kentucky Ryes, Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey delivers bold flavors of pepper and tobacco with a long fruit and sweetly spiced finish.


























Brown-Forman – Herradura 

















































 


















 

Herradura
Brown-Forman
2015-08-18T12:43:46+00:00







Herradura
Tequila Herradura is an ultra premium, 100% agave tequila, crafted using only the most mature blue agave, traditional production methods and fermented naturally with wild yeast. Produced by Casa Herradura, one of Mexico’s most historic and renowned tequila producers, on the premises of a 19th century Hacienda in Amatitán, Jalisco.
www.herradura.com










Herradura Añejo


Herradura Añejo matures in the barrel for 25 months, which is more than double the 1-year age requirement for a tequila to be considered an Añejo by Mexico law. This aging gives it both a deep amber color and a complex, spicy taste. Herradura Añejo was introduced by Casa Herradura in 1962.








Herradura
Reposado


Herradura Reposado ages in the barrels for eleven months, far longer than the two months which is required by law for this category. This gives the tequila its deep copper color. The Reposado category was created by Tequila Herradura in 1974.








Herradura Silver/Blanco


Herradura Silver is matured in American White Oak barrels produced in our own cooperage. Aged for a total of 45 days creating a smooth taste with a light straw color. Since 1870, Herradura Silver has maintained its reputation as one of finest tequilas in the world.








Herradura
Selección Suprema


Exclusively hand crafted and estate bottled at Casa Herradura, Selección Suprema de Herradura is the finest expression of tequila available in the world today. This 100% pure agave, extra añejo tequila is crafted using estate grown agave and time-honored traditional production methods. Its extended aging of 49 months in imported oak barrels creates a tequila that is exceptionally smooth and mellow.








Herradura Colección de la Casa


Colleccion de la Casa is the best example in the industry of how each source of flavor – agave, water, fermentation, distillation, and maturation – impacts the character of the final product and creates a totally new flavor profile.







Herradura Ultra


With the perfect blend of our premium Añejo and Extra Añejo barrels, ULTRA is a crystal-clear tequila. A subtle hint of agave nectar offers a superior taste that will transport tequila connoisseurs beyond smoothness.







Antiguo


Antiguo is a premium, 100% agave tequila crafted by Casa Herradura, one of Mexico’s most historic and renowned tequila producers, on the premises of a 19th century Hacienda in Amatitán, Jalisco.

Old Forester
Bourbon enthusiasts and bartenders today are seeking the genuine article. They have found a kindred spirit in America’s first bottled bourbon. Nearly a century and a half after its inception, the originality of Old Forester continues to be the source of inspiration for many new and distinctly flavorful expressions.
We invite you to tour our Old Forester bourbons. You will find that each offers its own distinct bourbon experience.
www.oldforester.com










Old Forester


Created in 1870, Old Forester is the only bourbon continuously distilled and marketed by the founding family before, during and after Prohibition. At 86 proof, Old Forester delivers a genuine bourbon experience, with rich, full flavor and a smooth character that is ideal for sipping neat, on the rocks, with a splash of water, or in a classic cocktail.








Old Forester Signature


A favorite of bartenders, Signature 100 Proof honors the legacy of founder George Garvin Brown, who put his signature on every bottle. And this bourbon is definitely one he would be proud to have his name on today.








Old Forester
Birthday Bourbon


Each year on Sept. 2 – in honor of our founder George Garvin Brown’s birthday – Old Forester releases its limited edition, vintage dated, Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. It has become a must-have for bourbon enthusiasts who want to experience the ultimate in rare handcrafted bourbon. Since its introduction in 2002, Old Forester Birthday Bourbon has received unprecedented acclaim, with an impressive collection of national and international whisky honors.








Old Forester Single Barrel


Every fingerprint is unique. The same is true for every barrel of bourbon. Old Forester Single Barrel comes from an individual barrel. So, there is no other bourbon exactly like it.








Old Forester 1870 Original Batch


In 1870 George Garvin Brown created Old Forester on Louisville, KY’s, famous Whiskey Row. In honor of that milestone year in bourbon history, we have crafted a tribute – Old Forester 1870 Original Batch – the first craft expression in the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series.








Old Forester 1897


This 100 proof expression is the second release in our Old Forester Whiskey Row Series was specially crafted to honor the U.S. Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897. After the U.S. Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897 to be labeled as Bottled in Bond, whisky must be the product of one distillation season, one distiller and from one distillery.








Old Forester Mint Julep


For generations, Louisville insiders have enjoyed mint juleps made with Louisville’s Hometown Bourbon™ – Old Forester.
In honor of that grand tradition, we created the Old Forester Mint Julep, named the Official Drink of the Kentucky Derby®.




























Brown-Forman – Santa Dose 
















































 


















 

Santa Dose
Jan Meredith
2016-09-11T09:45:05+00:00







Santa Dose
Spontaneous and symmetrical, casual and detailed, the identity of Santa Dosa was meticulously refined to represent the joining of contrasts – the perfect measure – the “perfect combination” of cachaça, honey and lime
Our symbol represents the ideal ratio of the mix of ingredients, which result in a cachaça of unmistakable taste.  Our logo, in all caps, black with visual weight, was created to cause on impact.
Put some curves over the vibrant yellow, colour spectrum and proprietary icons and our drink is complete – an invitation to have fun!

Brown-Forman – Jack Daniel’s 

















































 


















 

Jack Daniel’s
Brown-Forman
2016-02-24T10:04:31+00:00

     
Jack Daniel’s
Jack Daniel’s®, the world’s best selling whiskey, comes from North America’s oldest registered distillery, the Jack Daniel Distillery. The Distillery, founded in 1866 by Mr. Jack Daniel in Lynchburg (pop. 361), Tennessee, is one of the most well-known producers of whiskey in the world. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey is made with the finest corn, rye and barley malt. Its distinctive character is a result of natural fermentation, careful distillation, and use of the Distillery’s iron-free water from the Cave Spring that runs at a constant 56° F. www.jackdaniels.com     
   
Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey
  We do things a little differently around here – and that’s what gives Jack Daniel’s its distinctive character. We charcoal mellow our whiskey drop by drop, then let it age in our own handcrafted barrels. And we don’t follow a calendar. Our Tennessee Sippin’ Whiskey is ready only when our tasters say it is. We use our senses, just like Jack Daniel himself did. In fact, more than a century later, our Tennessee Whiskey is still judged the same way. By the way it looks. By the way it smells. And, of course, by the way it tastes.   
 

Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel
  We hold ourselves to the highest standard when crafting and selecting Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel. In fact, just one out of every 100 barrels are set aside to mature in the highest reaches of our barrelhouses, where dramatic temperature changes cause the color and taste to deepen further. Each barrel is hand-selected for its one-of-a-kind flavor, robust taste, and notes of toasted oak, vanilla, and caramel. It’s not easy making a whiskey like Single Barrel. But easy never interested us in the first place. 

 

 
Gentleman Jack Double Mellowed Tennessee Whiskey
  Just like Jack Daniel’s Tennessee A balanced whiskey with well-developed traces of vanilla, caramel and almond. An exceptionally smooth Tennessee whiskey with a rich, rewarding taste and a gentle farewell. The first whiskey in the world mellowed twice for ultimate smoothness. 

    
Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey
  Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey is a blend of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and a unique honey liqueur of our own making, for a taste that’s one-of-a-kind and unmistakably Jack. With hints of honey and a finish that’s naturally smooth, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey is something special. 

    
Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire
  Crafted with Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 Whiskey and naturally infused with a proprietary red hot cinnamon liqueur. Enticing to all the senses, the aroma of fiery spice blends with the mellowness of Jack Daniel’s and a hint of red hot cinnamon. The result is a sweet, hot cinnamon kick that complements the smooth and delicious taste of Jack Daniel’s, giving you a unique finish full of unmistakable character.

    
Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select
  Bottled at 90 proof, and made with unique “Sinatra Barrels”, Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select pays tribute to Jack’s biggest fan: Mr. Frank Sinatra. These Sinatra barrels have deep grooves on the inside of the staves — which exposes the whiskey to extra layers of oak. This imparts a rich amber color, bold character and a pleasant smokiness, followed by an incredibly smooth vanilla finish. Much like Frank himself, this whiskey is one of a kind. 

 
 

Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold
  Introducing Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold Tennessee Whiskey. A rich, exquisitely refined and distinctively finished expression of our original Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey. Crafted to the same uncompromising standards as Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7, our Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold earns its name from the double barreling and double mellowing. It is extra matured in golden-hued maple barrels and twice charcoal mellowed for luxurious hints of maple and an exceedingly smooth finish. The extra time and attention required to craft this ultra-smooth spirit means Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold will only be released in a limited number of places. 

    
Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack
  Jack Daniel’s Winter Jack is a seasonal blend of apple cider liqueur, Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey and holiday spices. It is based on an original family recipe from Jack’s home in Lynchburg, Tennessee. When it’s cold outside and snow is falling, our heartwarming Tennessee Cider should be enjoyed with friends and family. Winter Jack is best served warm. Once heated, it has an inviting aroma of warm apple cider, orange peel, cinnamon, clove and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. The taste is reminiscent of apple pie complemented with Tennessee Whiskey and seasonal spices, with a finish of toasted oak and vanilla. 

 
 

Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails
  Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails are the only flavored malt beverages today that combine natural citrus and fruit flavors with a slight hint of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. They are designed for consumers looking for a premium quality brand and the convenience of a ready-to-drink beverage that’s refreshing while also containing a little bit of the Jack Daniel’s attitude. 

    
Jack Daniel’s Ready to Drinks
  Until now, getting a drink mixed perfectly with Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey meant visiting your favorite bar and having a bartender make your call. Now you can enjoy a perfectly mixed Jack & Cola or Jack & Ginger in a convenient ready-to-drink, single serving. Each is a perfect mix of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey and your favorite ingredients ready whenever you make the call.

Coopers’ Craft, Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: history between 1870 and 2005. You can help by adding to it. (March 2015)


The company was founded in 1870 by George Garvin Brown, a young pharmaceuticals salesman in Louisville, who had the then-novel idea of selling top-grade whiskey in sealed glass bottles.
In 2005, the company sold its Lenox division (one of the oldest and most famous manufacturers of fine china in the United States), which had been acquired in 1983, to Department 56 for $USD 160 million. The income generated by the sale was distributed to the shareholders in the form of a one time special dividend.[citation needed]




Part of the company's Louisville complex


In 2006, the company acquired the Chambord liqueur brand (a super-premium black raspberry liqueur produced in France) for $US 255 million.[5][6]
In 2007, the company acquired Tequila Herradura, a Mexican company that produces the Casa Herradura tequila brand (a super-premium tequila produced in Mexico) for $US 776 million,[7] while it also sold its Hartman Luggage division (one of the leaders in the travel goods industry and originally a subdivision of Lenox), to Clarion Capitol Partners. One year later, it sold the Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian wine brands to Gruppo Italiano Vini (GIV). The terms of neither sale were disclosed.[citation needed]
In 2011, the company sold Fetzer Vineyards and associated brands to the Chilean wine producer Viña Concha y Toro S.A. for $US 238 million.[8]
In 2013, the company joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.
In 2016, the Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands were sold to Sazerac Company for $543 Million.[9]
In 2016, Brown-Forman also reached an agreement to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited for approximately £285 million. The purchase brought GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh to Brown-Forman's portfolio.[10]
The company is a sponsor of the Brown-Forman Retailer of the Year awards given by the American Beverage Licensees.[11]
Stock information[edit]
Brown Forman has two classes of common stock, both of which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares carry voting privileges and are thinly traded due to control by the Brown family while the Class B shares are Non-voting stock.
China bribery accusations[edit]
In 2011, Brown-Forman was accused of illegally subsidizing its distributors in China, and subsequently delaying payment to them as agreed under contract.[12] The Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce fined Brown-Forman 2 million renminbi (US$320,000) for illegal subsidization.[13]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: history between 1870 and 2005. You can help by adding to it. (March 2015)


The company was founded in 1870 by George Garvin Brown, a young pharmaceuticals salesman in Louisville, who had the then-novel idea of selling top-grade whiskey in sealed glass bottles.
In 2005, the company sold its Lenox division (one of the oldest and most famous manufacturers of fine china in the United States), which had been acquired in 1983, to Department 56 for $USD 160 million. The income generated by the sale was distributed to the shareholders in the form of a one time special dividend.[citation needed]




Part of the company's Louisville complex


In 2006, the company acquired the Chambord liqueur brand (a super-premium black raspberry liqueur produced in France) for $US 255 million.[5][6]
In 2007, the company acquired Tequila Herradura, a Mexican company that produces the Casa Herradura tequila brand (a super-premium tequila produced in Mexico) for $US 776 million,[7] while it also sold its Hartman Luggage division (one of the leaders in the travel goods industry and originally a subdivision of Lenox), to Clarion Capitol Partners. One year later, it sold the Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian wine brands to Gruppo Italiano Vini (GIV). The terms of neither sale were disclosed.[citation needed]
In 2011, the company sold Fetzer Vineyards and associated brands to the Chilean wine producer Viña Concha y Toro S.A. for $US 238 million.[8]
In 2013, the company joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.
In 2016, the Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands were sold to Sazerac Company for $543 Million.[9]
In 2016, Brown-Forman also reached an agreement to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited for approximately £285 million. The purchase brought GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh to Brown-Forman's portfolio.[10]
The company is a sponsor of the Brown-Forman Retailer of the Year awards given by the American Beverage Licensees.[11]
Stock information[edit]
Brown Forman has two classes of common stock, both of which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares carry voting privileges and are thinly traded due to control by the Brown family while the Class B shares are Non-voting stock.
China bribery accusations[edit]
In 2011, Brown-Forman was accused of illegally subsidizing its distributors in China, and subsequently delaying payment to them as agreed under contract.[12] The Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce fined Brown-Forman 2 million renminbi (US$320,000) for illegal subsidization.[13]

Research Paper



Abstract
This study showed that Brown-Forman Corporation’s (Brown-Forman) has a winning business strategy.  It passes the three major tests, which are the Fit Test, Competitive Advantage Test, and Performance Test.  The company’s strategy effectively addresses the company’s situation both internally and externally.  The strategy takes advantage of most of the industry’s trends, mitigates the negative impacts of the industry’s driving forces, and ensures that the company meets the industry’s key success factors.  It helps the company achieve sustainable competitive advantages by fully utilizing its biggest resources and capabilities.
The strategy has also directly contributed to the company’s financial success and market standing.   In comparison to its biggest competitor, Beam Inc. (Beam), Brown-Forman has significantly stronger financial position within the industry.   Some of its biggest financial strengths include its ability to generate cash from operations, obtain high returns from invested capital, and create strong, positive cash flows for future acquisitions and shareholder return.
Areas where the company could improve include developing strategies to address changes in regulatory and political environment, developing ways to guarantee a steady supply of their products’ key inputs, and utilizing strategic partnerships for distribution.  The company should also consider acquiring companies like the Firefly Distillery and Bacardi to expand their product breadth and geographic reach.

Brown-Forman answers consumer demand for premium whiskey with purchase of BenRiach Distillery 
By Mary Ellen Shoup+Mary Ellen Shoup 28-Apr-20162016-04-28T00:00:00ZLast updated on 28-Apr-2016 at 15:14 GMT2016-04-28T15:14:23Z



 Brown-Forman acquires Scotch whisky distillery in response to consumer demand for premium whisk(e)y.

Brown-Forman Corp. has agreed to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company for approximately $416m. The deal will add three Single Malt Scotch Whisky brands to Brown-Forman’s product portfolio: The GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh. 
 


 
“The acquisition of these super premium brands will allow Brown-Forman to re-enter one of our industry’s most exciting and consistent growth segments, Single Malt Scotch Whisky,” Brown-Forman CEO Paul Varga said in a press release.The transaction is expected to close on or about June 1, 2016.Responding to consumer preferencesThe acquisition of whiskey brands reflects the company’s continued interest in responding to a growing consumer preference for whiskey and other dark liquors over lighter liquors like vodka and rum. In June 2015, Brown-Forman also purchased Slane Castle Irish Whiskey.The purchase includes three malt distilleries (one for each of the newly acquired brands), a bottling plant, and the company’s headquarters in Edinburgh, Scotland.Brown-Forman’s whiskeys reported sales growth in 2015. Whiskey brand Jack Daniel’s rose 33% to 21.3 million 9-liter cases in 2015 from 16 million 9-liter cases in 2011. Similarly, the company’s Woodford Reserve bourbon brand increased its sales volume 30% in 2015 to 400,000 9-liter cases.Demand for premiumization According to a report by IBISWorld, the whiskey and bourbon distilleries industry's growth since 2013 has largely been the result of major premiumization.  


Consumers have experienced increasing disposable income since 2009, and as a result, many have sought higher-priced whiskey brands. Whiskey distillers are expected to continue steady growth into 2019, the market research report said.


US demand


The US in particular has experienced explosive growth with the number of distilleries reaching a post-prohibition high of 1,850, according to House Spirits CEO Thomas Mooney, who was speaking at The Beverage Forum event held in Chicago this week.Product differentiation in the form of premiumization is the main driver of growth for many spirit brands including whiskey, he added.




In particular, demand for Scotch whisky continues to grow, especially in the US which saw roughly $541 million in exports from the UK, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: history between 1870 and 2005. You can help by adding to it. (March 2015)


The company was founded in 1870 by George Garvin Brown, a young pharmaceuticals salesman in Louisville, who had the then-novel idea of selling top-grade whiskey in sealed glass bottles.
In 2005, the company sold its Lenox division (one of the oldest and most famous manufacturers of fine china in the United States), which had been acquired in 1983, to Department 56 for $USD 160 million. The income generated by the sale was distributed to the shareholders in the form of a one time special dividend.[citation needed]




Part of the company's Louisville complex


In 2006, the company acquired the Chambord liqueur brand (a super-premium black raspberry liqueur produced in France) for $US 255 million.[5][6]
In 2007, the company acquired Tequila Herradura, a Mexican company that produces the Casa Herradura tequila brand (a super-premium tequila produced in Mexico) for $US 776 million,[7] while it also sold its Hartman Luggage division (one of the leaders in the travel goods industry and originally a subdivision of Lenox), to Clarion Capitol Partners. One year later, it sold the Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian wine brands to Gruppo Italiano Vini (GIV). The terms of neither sale were disclosed.[citation needed]
In 2011, the company sold Fetzer Vineyards and associated brands to the Chilean wine producer Viña Concha y Toro S.A. for $US 238 million.[8]
In 2013, the company joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.
In 2016, the Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands were sold to Sazerac Company for $543 Million.[9]
In 2016, Brown-Forman also reached an agreement to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited for approximately £285 million. The purchase brought GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh to Brown-Forman's portfolio.[10]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: history between 1870 and 2005. You can help by adding to it. (March 2015)


The company was founded in 1870 by George Garvin Brown, a young pharmaceuticals salesman in Louisville, who had the then-novel idea of selling top-grade whiskey in sealed glass bottles.
In 2005, the company sold its Lenox division (one of the oldest and most famous manufacturers of fine china in the United States), which had been acquired in 1983, to Department 56 for $USD 160 million. The income generated by the sale was distributed to the shareholders in the form of a one time special dividend.[citation needed]




Part of the company's Louisville complex


In 2006, the company acquired the Chambord liqueur brand (a super-premium black raspberry liqueur produced in France) for $US 255 million.[5][6]
In 2007, the company acquired Tequila Herradura, a Mexican company that produces the Casa Herradura tequila brand (a super-premium tequila produced in Mexico) for $US 776 million,[7] while it also sold its Hartman Luggage division (one of the leaders in the travel goods industry and originally a subdivision of Lenox), to Clarion Capitol Partners. One year later, it sold the Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian wine brands to Gruppo Italiano Vini (GIV). The terms of neither sale were disclosed.[citation needed]
In 2011, the company sold Fetzer Vineyards and associated brands to the Chilean wine producer Viña Concha y Toro S.A. for $US 238 million.[8]
In 2013, the company joined leading alcohol producers as part of a producers' commitments to reducing harmful drinking.
In 2016, the Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands were sold to Sazerac Company for $543 Million.[9]
In 2016, Brown-Forman also reached an agreement to purchase The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited for approximately £285 million. The purchase brought GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh to Brown-Forman's portfolio.[10]
The company is a sponsor of the Brown-Forman Retailer of the Year awards given by the American Beverage Licensees.[11]
Stock information[edit]
Brown Forman has two classes of common stock, both of which are traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares carry voting privileges and are thinly traded due to control by the Brown family while the Class B shares are Non-voting stock.
China bribery accusations[edit]
In 2011, Brown-Forman was accused of illegally subsidizing its distributors in China, and subsequently delaying payment to them as agreed under contract.[12] The Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce fined Brown-Forman 2 million renminbi (US$320,000) for illegal subsidization.[13]
Environmental track record[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (November 2013)
