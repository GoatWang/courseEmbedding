HMS Holdings Corp. (Healthcare Management Systems) (NASDAQ:HMSY) was founded in 1974 and is based in Irving, Texas. The company offers cost containment services to healthcare payers and sponsors, including co-ordination of benefits services and program integrity services. Both services aim to ensure that healthcare claims are paid correctly. Customers of the company involve both governments and individuals, like state Medicaid agencies (served 47 states in 2012), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

Products and services[edit]
The company’s co-ordination of benefits services include providing validated insurance and helping find liable third parties. Their program integrity services identify improper payments and over-payments and attempt recovery, as well as reduce fraud and waste. In addition, the company also supports Medicaid Managed Care Organizations and Medicare Advantage Plans.[1]
Operations[edit]
In April of 2017, HMS Holdings acquired the Eliza Corporation, a privately-held health engagement management and member analytics firm providing comprehensive and personalized member-centric outreach and engagement solutions, for a cash purchase price of $170 million.[2]
In December 2012, HMS Holdings acquired the assets and liabilities of MedRecovery Management, LLC (MRM), for about $11.8 million, with $10.8 million initial cash payment and $1.0 million in future contingent payments.[3]
In 2006, the Company announced to acquire the assets of PCG's Benefits Solutions Practice Area (BSPA) for $80 million in cash, shares of Holdings common stock and a contingent cash payment of up to $15 million.[4]
Awards[edit]
In February 2014, HMS Holdings’ Chief Security Officer Scott Pettigrew won the CSO Compass Awards by CSO magazine. Pettigrew has been working in Security for about twenty years and spent the last four years at HMS. He led the company’s first risk-based security program in 2010.[5]
In 2012 and 2013, HMS Holdings was included in the InformationWeek 500.[6]
In 2013, HMS Holdings was included on Modern Healthcare magazine's “Healthcare’s Hottest" list as one of the 40 fastest growing companies in healthcare.[7]

Is HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) Ready For a Pullback?  RMI in Focus – Evergreen Caller

Is HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) Ready For a Pullback?  RMI in Focus
 Jul 21, 2017
 Evergreen Staff Contributor









HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) shares have popped up on the radar as the RMI or Relative Momentum Indicator has trended higher over the past 5 sessions.  As the momentum builds, we will be closely watching to see if they cross into Overbought territory. 
The Relative Momentum Index is calculated as the ratio of average upward price changes to the average absolute price change.   The index requires two parameters.  The first parameter is the number of periods used to determine price change.  The second parameter is the number of periods to average these changes over. The permissible values for RMI lie in the range between 0 and 100. Whilst a crossing of the center line may be interpreted as a warning of an impending trend change, only values over 70 are usually regarded as a buy signal and those below 30 as a sell signal.
Tracking additional stock levels, HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 244.66. Even though the name contains the word commodity, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was developed to typically stay within the -100 to +100 levels. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.
A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a certain period of time. They may also be used to assist the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. Currently, HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) has a 200-day MA of 19.01, and a 50-day of 18.64. Presently, the stock has a 14-day RSI of 59.65, the 7-day is sitting at 71.80, and the 3-day is resting at 91.30. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems” which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. 
HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -18.30. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold. We can also take a look at the Average Directional Index or ADX of the stock. For traders looking to capitalize on trends, the ADX may be an essential technical tool. The ADX is used to measure trend strength. ADX calculations are made based on the moving average price range expansion over a specified amount of time. ADX is charted as a line with values ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is non-directional meaning that it gauges trend strength whether the stock price is trending higher or lower. The 14-day ADX for HMS Holdings Corp (HMSY) presently sits at 16.28. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would indicate a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would signify an extremely strong trend.

HMS Holdings Corp. (Healthcare Management Systems) (NASDAQ:HMSY) was founded in 1974 and is based in Irving, Texas. The company offers cost containment services to healthcare payers and sponsors, including co-ordination of benefits services and program integrity services. Both services aim to ensure that healthcare claims are paid correctly. Customers of the company involve both governments and individuals, like state Medicaid agencies (served 47 states in 2012), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

Products and services[edit]
The company’s co-ordination of benefits services include providing validated insurance and helping find liable third parties. Their program integrity services identify improper payments and over-payments and attempt recovery, as well as reduce fraud and waste. In addition, the company also supports Medicaid Managed Care Organizations and Medicare Advantage Plans.[1]
Operations[edit]
In April of 2017, HMS Holdings acquired the Eliza Corporation, a privately-held health engagement management and member analytics firm providing comprehensive and personalized member-centric outreach and engagement solutions, for a cash purchase price of $170 million.[2]
In December 2012, HMS Holdings acquired the assets and liabilities of MedRecovery Management, LLC (MRM), for about $11.8 million, with $10.8 million initial cash payment and $1.0 million in future contingent payments.[3]
In 2006, the Company announced to acquire the assets of PCG's Benefits Solutions Practice Area (BSPA) for $80 million in cash, shares of Holdings common stock and a contingent cash payment of up to $15 million.[4]
Awards[edit]
In February 2014, HMS Holdings’ Chief Security Officer Scott Pettigrew won the CSO Compass Awards by CSO magazine. Pettigrew has been working in Security for about twenty years and spent the last four years at HMS. He led the company’s first risk-based security program in 2010.[5]
In 2012 and 2013, HMS Holdings was included in the InformationWeek 500.[6]
In 2013, HMS Holdings was included on Modern Healthcare magazine's “Healthcare’s Hottest" list as one of the 40 fastest growing companies in healthcare.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
