Athena, goddess of wisdom


















Athena, goddess of wisdom

Though Hercules had an enemy, Hera, on Mount Olympus, he also had a friend.

Athena, the goddess of wisdom and military victory,  and also the patron of the city of Athens, was Hercules' half-sister. Her parents were Zeus and Metis, a nymph. Zeus heard a prophecy that the child Metis bore after she gave birth to Athena would become the lord of heaven, so, to prevent this from happening, he swallowed Metis while she was still pregnant with Athena.

When the time came for Athena to be born, the smith god, Hephaistos, opened Zeus' head with an axe, and Athena stepped out, in full armor. The birth of Athena was a favorite topic of Greek vase painters.

Athena often helped heroes, like Jason and Perseus. She wore an aegis, a goatskin shield which had a fringe of snakes. When Perseus killed the gorgon Medusa, whose face turned men to stone, he gave the gorgon head to Athena, and the goddess placed it on her aegis.

When Hercules went mad and killed his children, Athena stopped the disaster from getting worse. Just as the insane hero turned to kill Amphitryon, Athena threw a stone at Hercules, knocking him unconscious, so his mortal father was spared. Athena also helped Hercules at many points during his Labors. She provided him with the krotala he used to scare the Stymphalian Birds, and she carried the apples back to the garden of the Hesperides.

AthenaHealth is a cloud-based full service EMR, inclduing Practice Management, and Care Coordination.  You do not need to buy  hardware or software, because you connect via the web from any computer. AthenaHealth also does not charge licensing fees. 

What stands out most about the Athenahealth model is that the company commits real people for support, and they are involved in all steps of the EHR, both in using its different components, and in realizing Meaningful Use. The way the company describes it on their website, “Unlike a traditional EMR, we offer full-service support and coaching that helps you achieve Meaningful Use measures and guides you to the finish line.”  

This human team behind the software is involved   in smoothing difficulties between healthcare organizations, as well as software entities. They even handle  scanning and categorizing back office documents including every incoming fax into the EMR database. They also match clinical documents to existing patients and patient orders, enter select data, route information to appropriate staff members, and store documents where they can be readily accessed.  So Athenahealth provides an EHR / EHR  with a shadow coaching team. 

The  full EHR has 4 major parts (plus many apps): 

Athenaclinicals is the electronic medical record clinical charting portion of the EMR.  Athena claims to offer flexible charting options and back-office document support staff that scans and faxes incoming orders and test and lab results and puts them into your patient charts.

Since the whole EMR is in the cloud, updates never have to be installed and the rules based Quality Management Engine stays up to date with new regulations and clinical information that includes a continuously updated database that injects clinical knowledge into your patient encounters.  A strong Quality Performance Team of real people  is constantly looking for and incorporating new Pay-for-Performance changes and rules so you’re always up to date clinically and regulation-wise. 
AthenaCollector is the practice management portion of the EMR. Athenahealth is hosted on Athenanet, and  and managed by Athenahealth personnel (it is not outsourced).  All hardware and software upgrades are handled internally.  The PM portion of AthenaHealth includes scheduling, billing, patient registration, practice management and practice metric tools.
AthenaCommunicator handles communications between patients and doctors has 4 parts: a messaging platform;  a patient web portal; live operator services; ;and self-pay reminder service. 
Athenacoordinator is aimed at simplifying order transmission, : makes the sharing of information much easier by allowing caregivers to send physicians orders right from their workflow.  Facilities that received doctors orders  get clean, clear orders that are legible and easy to read.  The receiving organizations pay only $1 nominal fee for each order.
AthenaClarity is a data analytics module that offers you Financial  and Operations Management help as well as Population Health Management and Care Management. These capabilities that can move your practice toward using big data solutions.  

Some of the Apps offered by Athena Health are:

The Epocrates #1 mobile reference app.  (According to the Wall Street Journal, November 18, 2013, it is one of the oldest and mmost established medical apps, and has replaced use of the PDR for many users).
The Revenue Calculator tool 
PracticeVitals app, metrics to measure practice success 
CodeView app to check reimbursements for procedures.



AthenaHealth claims that its EMR product, AthenaClinicals, is ranked #1 in the KLAS EMR Usability Report.
Athenahealth Software Updates
Spring 2016:

Athenahealth recently acquired Arsenal Health, a company involved in  big data analytics and machine learning in the  healthcare arena. Arsenal Health’s Arsenal Health’s schedule optimization solution will become part of Athenahealth. The company hopes that acquiring this expertise will help it grow its capabilities in machine learning and predictive analytics.  These data mining capabilities, together with Athenahealth’s 74 million plus patient records, should afford Athenahealth a lot of additional medical, statistical and financial insights.

February 2015:
This month,  Athenahealth, Inc. announced that it has purchased webOMR, a web-based clinical applications and electronic health record (EHR) platform developed by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston. WebOMR is one of the first hospital-built, inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Athenahealth hopes to combine its own technical expertise with the large-hospital based EHR expertise of WebOMR.

The two organizations plan  to work together on the development of Athenahealth’s acute care service offering.  This is envisioned to be a product that will support the EHR needs of large hospitals and health systems across the U.S. 
Summer 2014:

Athenahealth, Inc.and Henry Schein, Inc. one of the world’s largest provider of health care products and services including  dental, animal health, and medical practitioners, announced an expansion of their earlier cooperative strategic agreement. Athenahealth’s athenaNet® platform and Henry Schein’s Dentrix® Enterprise, the leading Electronic Dental Record (EDR) will integrate their systems to make  Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting easier. UDC reporting is a requirement for CHCs, including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).
