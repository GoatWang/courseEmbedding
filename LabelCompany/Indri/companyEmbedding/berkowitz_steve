A little about me

Senior Digital Operations Executive 

				 "One of those rare individuals who can easily bridge the divide that sometimes separate business and technology groups.  He is highly adept at distilling complex operational issues to their essential components, and through a focused and pragmatic approach, bringing those to an effective and efficient resolution.
			"





 My strongest asset is a unique ability to take complex business requirements and translate them into technical specifications that have jump started productivity, increased company’s customer base, and dramatically lowered inefficient and repetitive tasks. 
I am technically-savvy and a driven-to-succeed problem solving manager and leader, successful at building small to mid-sized core agency teams, including account and project management, creative, interactive, and strategy. 
I have led the identification, development and implementation of broad-based solutions to enhance program operations, drive business results and achieve organizational growth in the pharmaceutical, advertising, and medical communications industries.
					
Skills Bar Chart
Business Relationship Management is a formal approach to understanding, defining, and supporting inter-business activities related to business networking.
					
I have found over the years that I can be the liason between the Business (either Client or internal account teams), and the IT or Digital teams. 
Starting my career in Radio and Television Production introduced me into really listening to the objectives of the client, and translating those into creative, efficient messaging, outcomes, and projects.

By identifying, analyzing and improving upon existing business processes within your organization, I will optimize and  meet new quotas or standards of quality.

November 11, 2015 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lumos Labs, the maker of Lumosity, today announced that Steve Berkowitz 
      has been named Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective as of 
      November 2015. Berkowitz succeeds Kunal Sarkar, a co-founder of the 
      company, who has been appointed chairman of the board of directors and 
      will continue to work with the company’s leadership on strategy and 
      long-term vision.
    


      “It has been extremely rewarding to see Lumosity grow over the past 10 
      years from a concept to a full-fledged product offering with more than 
      70 million users across the globe. I have been working on a CEO 
      succession plan for some time to ensure that Lumos Labs continues to 
      evolve and grow in the right way,” said Sarkar. “After a lengthy search 
      process, I believe that Steve is the right person for this role - he is 
      a seasoned leader with a stellar track record, having previously led two 
      public companies as CEO. I’m excited that he is on board to scale our 
      company to the next level.”
    

      “I have been a long-time fan of Lumosity and am excited to have been 
      chosen to take on the role of CEO at Lumos Labs,” said Berkowitz. 
      “Lumosity has been instrumental in defining the cognitive training 
      space, both for consumers and researchers, and I look forward to leading 
      the company through its next stage of growth.”
    

      Berkowitz has over 30 years of senior management experience and was most 
      recently the CEO of Move Inc. from 2009 to 2014, running both a SAAS 
      business for real estate professionals and the consumer brand realtor.com. 
      In September 2014, he presided over the $950 million acquisition of Move 
      by News Corp.
    

      Earlier in his career, Berkowitz served as the CEO of Ask Jeeves (Ask.com). 
      He was credited with building the management team that led Ask.com to 
      grow from $40 million to $1.85 billion in value, and in 2005, he led the 
      sale of the business to IAC/InterActive Corporation for $1.85 billion.
    

      Berkowitz has also served as the Senior Vice President of the Online 
      Services Group for Microsoft, which included MSN.com, 
      advertising sales, business development, and marketing for Live 
      Platform, Search, MSN and Windows Live.
    

      Berkowitz also served as the President and Chief Operating Officer of 
      IDG Books, a company that went public in 1998, where he successfully 
      expanded the “Dummies” 
      series of books into a celebrated consumer brand covering everything 
      from C++ to pet care from 1994 to 1999. Berkowitz began his career in 
      the education and publishing space, and has held senior leadership 
      positions at Intermap Systems, Henry Holt Publishing and MacMillan 
      Publishing. Berkowitz graduated from State University of New York at 
      Albany with a B.A. in Accounting.
