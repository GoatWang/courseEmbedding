What we've done


We have partnered with the following companies recently:

































































































"We look to partner with companies, rather than just transact for them" 
CCP offers Investment, Capital Raising, Strategic Partnerships, Business & Financial Advice, Mentoring and Shareholder Engagement
 










What our clients say

















We're really pleased to have successfully closed out our funding round. The team at Clinton have been great to work with, getting us in front of the right investors and managing the whole process.






Tom Moore
CEO & Founder - WYWM







We would like to thank CCP for the simplicity in raising capital. Their ability to understand our business, connect us with strategic investors, speed in raising capital was incredibly beneficial. CCP really allowed us to get on and grow our business.






Angus Woods
CEO & Founder - Adviser Ratings







A huge thank you to the team at CCP. That  you closed (and actually oversubscribed) our capital raise in just 3 days genuinely exceeded our expectations. On top of that, the strategic investors you introduced and the level of guidance you offered, was the most professional we have experienced, and created a foundation of respect that we really value. We truly look forward to partnering with CCP in the future.






Rose Kentish & Anouk Darling
Directors - Sparkke Change Brewing Company







Thank you to the team at CCP. Your access to influential money, ability to simplify our transaction and the doors you opened for us were by far the best we have seen in the market place. We look forward to working with you in the future.






Jon Kontopos
CEO & Founder - DCG







We would like to thank CCP for the way you managed our transaction, the connections you made and the quality of strategic investors you delivered. We look forward to working with you along our journey.






Simon Pomeroy
CEO - Fulcrum







Clinton Capital Partners have played a crucial part in our startup journey. Without their work ethic and networking expertise, we would not have secured important strategic investors for our investment round. The team not only afforded us great access and guidance throughout the process, but also secured our new stakeholders far ahead of schedule. We look forward to working together during the exciting times ahead.






Dr. Nikhil Pooviah
CEO & Founder - CancerAid







I wanted to thank CCP again for your time and your thoroughly professional process. Your organisation was by far the most impressive we have encountered, and we appreciated all of your help and the quality leads you introduced us to along the way






Kevin Baum
CEO / Co-Founder - AgriWebb







Working with Clinton Capital Partners has been a game changer for me.  As I was looking for 'smart money' from day one, we only focused on strategic investors and closed the round in a few weeks.  CCP always gave constructive feedback and advice and, as a result, I had more time to work on the product with the team!  I would definitely recommend their services to early stage startups or those looking to scale up.

Reference NPI Information

Field Name

Description





                                NPI
                            

                                1649416231
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Organization
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
                            



                                Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name)
                            

                                CLINTON PARTNERS, LLC
                            

                                Provide organization name (legal business name used to file tax returns with the IRS). The Organization Name field allows the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, "at" sign, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.
                            



                                Provider Other Organization Name
                            

                                SURGERY CENTER OF CLINTON TOWNSHIP
                            

                                Other name by which the organization provider is or has been known.
                            



                                Provider Other Organization Name Type Code
                            

                                3
                            

                                Code identifying the type of other name. Codes are: 1 = former name; 2 = professional name; 3 = doing business as (d/b/a) name; 4 = former legal business name; 5 = other.
