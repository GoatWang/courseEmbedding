Engage, Develop and Grow Your TeamExclusively for Healthcare
You can't improve what you don't measure.  HealthStream has the tools you need to gain actionable insight into employee engagement and leadership potential at your organization.  Our wide-variety of engagement surveys (ranging from targeted to annual) were designed by healthcare experts and measure employee satisfaction with the most critical success factors in the hospital environment. Engaged employees can result in improved productivity, higher patient satisfaction, and increased profitability.  Then, turn your healthcare staff with high potential into high performers with HealthStream's leadership development solutions. 
 








Develop and Retain the Right People in Healthcare.
People in healthcare know better than anyone that these are challenging times.  Healthcare providers are function on a landscape that seems to be reshaped on a daily basis.  Uncertainty during times of organizational change may adversely affect healthcare employee satisfaction.  Engaged employees and emerging leaders are essential in navigating this ocean of change and preparing your organization for the future.  Our engagement surveys and leadership development solutions should be included in any healthcare organization’s change management process.
Our employee engagement surveys will measure and monitor engagement during difficult times of change.
During times of change, organizations that recognize the significant impact engagement questionnaires can have will come out ahead.
Organizational changes affect engagement, but many struggle with effective strategies and actions to improve engagement during this time.
Challenging times are when strong leader's rise to the occasion.  Navigate change by developing your future healthcare leaders now.

	HEALTHSTREAM ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER & FULL YEAR 2016 RESULTS






	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (February 21, 2017)

	HealthStream, Inc. (NASDAQ: HSTM), a leading provider of
	workforce, patient experience, and provider solutions for the healthcare industry, announced today
	results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016.





	Fourth Quarter




	Revenues of $58.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 5% from $55.9 million in the
	fourth quarter of 2015

	Operating loss of $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to operating income
	of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015

	Net loss of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $1.8
	million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and loss per share of $(0.01) in the fourth quarter
	of 2016, compared to earnings per share (EPS) of $0.06 per share (diluted) in the fourth
	quarter of 2015

	Adjusted EBITDA

	1

	of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to
	adjusted EBITDA of $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015



	Full Year



	Revenues of $226.0 million for 2016, up 8% from $209.0 million in 2015

	Operating income of $5.6 million in 2016, down 59% from $13.6 million in 2015

	Net income of $3.8 million in 2016, down 56% from $8.6 million in 2015, and EPS of $0.12 per
	share (diluted) for 2016, compared to $0.28 per share (diluted) in 2015

	Adjusted EBITDA

	1

	of $29.9 million in 2016, down 12% from $33.8 million in 2015




	Financial Results:



	Fourth Quarter 2016 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2015


	Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by $2.8 million, or five percent, to $58.7
	million, compared to $55.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.



	Revenues from our HealthStream Workforce Solutions segment, which are primarily subscription-based,
	were approximately $43.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $42.8 million for the
	fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue growth of $0.7 million from our workforce solutions products was
	mostly offset by a decline in ICD-10 readiness revenue. Revenues from ICD-10-readiness training
	products declined by $5.5 million to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $6.6
	million in the prior year fourth quarter.



	1  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net
	income and disclosure regarding why we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to
	investors is included later in this release.



	1




	Revenues from our HealthStream Patient Experience Solutions segment decreased by $660,000, or
	eight percent, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues from Patient Insights
	surveysa survey research product that generates recurring revenuesdecreased by $221,000, or



	three percent, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in revenue in this segment
	is partially due to changes in product mix, such as the adoption of our e-survey products, which
	has lower revenue and cost per survey. E-survey products have higher gross margins than our
	traditional phone survey products. Revenues from other patient experience solutions, including
	surveys conducted on annual or bi-annual cycles and consulting/coaching services, collectively
	decreased by $439,000, or 25 percent, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease is
	primarily due to the timing of engagements compared to the prior year period.


	Revenues from our HealthStream Provider Solutions segment increased by $2.8 million, or 63 percent,
	when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues from both the Health

	Line

	Systems (HLS) and
	Morrisey Associates, Inc. (MAI) acquisitions, which were consummated in March 2015 and August 2016,
	respectively, accounted for the majority of the increase in revenues during the fourth quarter of
	2016. MAI revenues in the fourth quarter were approximately $1.7 million, net of deferred revenue
	write-downs.


	Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require companies to write down beginning balances
	of acquired deferred revenue balances as part of fair value accounting as defined by GAAP. During
	the fourth quarter of 2016, HealthStream reported a $1.3 million reduction to operating income and
	a $0.9 million reduction to net income as a result of the deferred revenue write-down for the HLS
	and MAI acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of 2015, HealthStream reported a reduction of $1.5
	million to operating income and $1.3 million to net income as a result of the deferred revenue
	write-down for the HLS acquisition. The table reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures
	included in this release shows the impact of beginning balance deferred revenue write-downs on
	operating income and net income.


	Operating loss was $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to operating income of $1.9
	million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 noted
	above was more than offset by increased operating expenses associated with the MAI acquisition,
	costs associated with our customer Summit, higher royalties, depreciation and amortization,
	personnel additions, and other general expenses. The MAI acquisition resulted in a $1.3 million
	reduction to operating income during fourth quarter of 2016, after giving effect to a $1.1 million
	deferred revenue write-down as referenced above. In addition, expenses related to our customer
	Summit reduced operating income by approximately $600,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Also, the
	$5.5 million reduction in revenue associated with ICD-10 readiness training products contributed to
	the reduction in operating income compared to the prior year.


	Net loss was $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to net income $1.8 million in the
	fourth quarter of 2015. This net loss in 2016 in comparison to the prior quarter net income amount
	resulted from the lower contribution of ICD-10 readiness products and increased operating expenses,
	partially offset by revenue increases related to the MAI and HLS acquisitions. Loss per share of
	$(0.01) per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to EPS of $0.06 per share (diluted) for
	the fourth quarter of 2015.


	Adjusted EBITDA (which we define as net income before interest, income taxes, share-based
	compensation, and depreciation and amortization) decreased by 15 percent to $6.1 million for the
	fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in
	adjusted EBITDA resulted from the lower contribution of ICD-10 readiness products and increased
	operating expenses, partially offset by revenue increases related to the MAI and HLS acquisitions.


	At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and marketable securities of $103.2 million. Capital
	expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 were approximately $4.2 million.


	2




	Year-to-Date 2016 Compared to Year-to-Date 2015


	For 2016, revenues were $226.0 million, an increase of eight percent over revenues of $209.0
	million in 2015. Operating income for 2016 decreased by 59 percent to $5.6 million, compared to
	$13.6 million for 2015. Net income for 2016 decreased by 56 percent to $3.8 million, compared to
	$8.6 million for 2015. Earnings per share were $0.12 per share (diluted) for 2016 compared to
	$0.28 per share (diluted) for 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12 percent to $29.9 million for
	2016 compared to $33.8 million for 2015. Capital expenditures incurred during 2016 were
	approximately $14.4 million.



	Other Business Updates


	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,468,000 total subscribers implemented to use and
	4,554,000 total subscribers contracted to use our subscription-based solutions. Contracted
	subscribers include both those already implemented and those under contract that are in the
	process of implementation. Revenue recognition commences when a contract is fully implemented.



	Annualized revenue per implemented subscriber for Workforce Solutions


	We view the metric, Annualized Revenue per Implemented Subscriber for our Workforce Solutions
	(Workforce ARIS), as one of several measures of our progress in growing the value of our customer
	base. Workforce ARIS represents the quarters revenue from our subscription-based solutions,
	annualized, then divided by the quarters average total number of implemented subscribers. Our
	subscription-based solutions include subscriptions to our platform applications, plus
	courseware/content subscriptions.

	For the fourth quarter of 2016, HealthStreams Workforce ARIS was $37.28, compared to last years
	fourth quarter of $36.96, but declined by $0.52, or one percent per implemented subscriber compared
	to the third quarter of 2016. Subscription-based revenues and implemented subscribers were both
	comparable to last years fourth quarter.


	On October 26-28, 2016, we welcomed approximately 800 of our customers from across the nation to
	our 2016 Customer Summit, held in Nashville. At this event, 75 break-out sessions were held and
	three keynote addresses were provided to our customers on a wide range of topics. Moreover,
	important workforce issues surrounding clinical education, compliance, human resources, leadership
	& strategy, and improving patients experiences were discussed and best practices were shared.
	Additionally, for the first time, our Customer Summit included a dedicated track for customers of
	HealthStreams Provider Solutions.



	Financial Outlook for 2017


	For 2017, we anticipate that consolidated revenues will grow 10 to 14 percent as compared to 2016.
	We anticipate that revenue growth in our Workforce Solutions segment will be in the three to seven
	percent range and five to eight percent in our Patient Experience Solutions segment. We anticipate
	our Provider Solutions segments revenue to grow 66 to 72 percent as compared to 2016.


	We anticipate operating income for 2017 to increase between 50 and 65 percent as compared to 2016.


	We anticipate that capital expenditures will be between $15 million and $17 million during 2017. We
	expect the annual effective income tax rate to range between 39 percent and 41 percent for 2017.


	This guidance does not include the impact of any other acquisitions that we may complete during
	2017.


	Robert A. Frist, Jr. chief executive officer, HealthStream, commented, The second half of 2016 has
	been very busy with three acquisitions, our Customer Summit, and new product launches. We look
	forward to delivering full-year revenue growth of 10 to 14 percent and returning to leveraged
	operating income growth in 2017.


	A conference call with Robert A. Frist, Jr., chief executive officer, Gerard M. Hayden, Jr., senior
	vice president and chief financial officer, and Mollie Condra, vice president of investor relations
	and corporate communications, will be held on Wednesday, February 22, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. (ET). To

	This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net
	income, non-GAAP operating income, and adjusted EBITDA, which are used by management in analyzing
	the Companys financial results and ongoing operational performance.



	In order to better assess the Companys financial results, management believes that net income
	before interest, income taxes, share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization (adjusted
	EBITDA) is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because
	adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items. We believe that
	adjusted EBITDA is also used by many investors to assess the Companys results from current
	operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a
	measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement
	determined in accordance with GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly,
	adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
	companies.


	In recent years, the Company has acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred
	revenue. In accordance with GAAP reporting requirements, following the completion of any such
	acquisition, the Company may record a write-down of deferred revenue to fair value as defined in
	GAAP. If the Company is required to record a write-down of deferred revenue, it may result in lower
	recognized revenue, operating income, and net income in subsequent periods.


	In connection therewith, this release presents below non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net
	income, which in each such case reflects the corresponding GAAP figures adjusted to exclude the
	impact of the deferred revenue write-down associated with fair value accounting for acquired
	businesses as referenced above. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP
	financial measures assists investors in understanding the Companys performance between periods
	excluding the impact of this deferred revenue write-down and provides a useful measure of the
	ongoing performance of the Company. Both on a quarterly and year-to-date basis, the revenue for the
	acquired business is deferred and typically recognized over a one to two year period following the
	completion of any particular acquisition, so our GAAP revenues for this one to two year period will
	not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred
	revenue was not written down to fair value.


	These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to,
	measures of financial performance which are prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different
	from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the
	reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, which are set forth below in this
	release.
