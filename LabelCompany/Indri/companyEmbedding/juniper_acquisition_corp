Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks campus in Amsterdam


Juniper Networks, Inc. is an information technology and computer networking products multinational company, founded in 1996.[1]
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[2] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[3] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[4] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[5]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[6] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[7][8]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[9] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[9][10] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[11] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[12] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[13]

Welcome Aurrion to Juniper Networks




by


Pradeep Sindhu

		

	
		on 
‎08-02-2016
05:00 AM





















Since founding Juniper Networks 20 years ago, I’ve worked tirelessly with Juniper engineers to deliver on our commitment to invest in and incubate disruptive innovation.
 
Today, I’m pleased to share that Juniper Networks has entered into an agreement to acquire Aurrion, a disruptive innovator in silicon-photonics technology. If you’re not familiar with silicon-photonics, consider this:
 
Over the past almost two decades, Juniper has dramatically reduced the cost per bit-per-second of the electronics portion of networking systems. Unfortunately, the optoelectronics portion—the one that converts electricity to light and vice-versa—has not followed a similar cost curve.
 
Historically, the optoelectronic portion represented significantly less than half the cost of a networking system, especially for optoelectronics designed for short to medium distances. If we fast forward to today, we see that things have completely reversed: the optoelectronics portion now represents significantly more than half the cost.
 
And here’s the real problem—the explosive growth of video streaming, social networking and other bandwidth intensive applications such as data center to data center traffic means that there is no letup in the hunger for greater bandwidth at ever decreasing cost and ever increasing flexibility.
 
Something has to change.
 
Introducing Aurrion
Aurrion has invented breakthrough technology that combines the economies of scale pioneered by the silicon industry with the unique properties of light to carry information over long distances at significantly lower cost. The end result? Dramatically lower cost per bit-per-second for networking systems, higher capacities for networking interfaces, and greater flexibility in how bandwidth carried on light is processed inside the electronic portions of networking systems.
 
Why Juniper and Aurrion?
As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, Juniper will continue to be a leader in the industry in developing the network infrastructure that powers this transformation. We expect that Aurrion’s breakthrough technology will result in fundamental and permanent improvements in cost per bit-per-second, power per bit-per-second, bandwidth density, and flexibility of networking systems. If we couple this new technology with Juniper’s history of bringing innovative networking products to market, we believe we can make significant improvements to the foundations of all of our networking products within a relatively short time.
 
Simply put, we believe this acquisition will strengthen Juniper’s ability to bring the most advanced and most cost effective network products to market more quickly.
 
Please join me in welcoming Aurrion to the Juniper community. We look forward to sharing more with you as we continue to combine our strengths for the benefit of our customers and our industry.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this blog concerning Juniper Networks' business, strategy and focus; market demand; the results and improvements made possible by Aurrion’s technology, including as combined with Juniper Networks solutions; the impact of the acquisition on our ability to bring the most advanced and cost effective network products to market; and our overall future prospects are forward-looking statements that involve a number of uncertainties and risks. Actual results or events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including our ability to close the contemplated acquisition and integrate the acquired company and its technology and other factors listed in our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All statements made in this blog are made only as of August 2, 2016. Juniper Networks undertakes no obligation to update the information in this blog in the event facts or circumstances subsequently change after the date of this blog.

  (Ashraf%20Aziz)   07-20-2017  

Contrary to popular belief, automation does require some level of human interaction. For example, when you step into a self-driving car, it does not automatically know where to go or when to start driving—you have to start the car and tell it your desired destination in order to achieve your goal. Automation, therefore, can only complete a task that has been initiated by a human.

Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) have revolutionized the traditional communication network architectures and have transformed the way communication service providers (CSPs) design their network infrastructure and services. The implementation of the Service Provider Cloud (Telco Cloud, Cable Cloud or Mobile Cloud architecture) is a strategic step for SPs to become competitive in the Digital Cohesion era...

The open programmability of the Juniper Networks Junos operating system has ushered in a new era of business innovation. Service providers and enterprises alike can maximize business outcomes by automating network operations. Rather than manually deploy and manage a network infrastructure that can only scale as fast as existing resources allow, one can now leverage APIs, scripts, and an open-source framework to build...

Everywhere Networking
On June 20th, Juniper announced the concept or “Cloud-Grade Networking,” which builds on carrier-grade reach and reliability and enterprise-grade control and usability to bring cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks everywhere.
 
One of the tenets of Cloud-Grade Networking is the ability to run anywhere and everywhere—on any software, on any hardware, in any cloud. Juniper calls t...

Cloud-Grade Networking: For the Win




by


Khutchins

		

	
		on 
‎06-21-2017
07:00 AM




















We live in exciting and disruptive times where everything is shifting to the cloud. Carrier-grade networking has been the foundation of the internet that we have come to know and love. There continues to be an insatiable need for network capacity, with global Ethernet traffic volume estimated to reach 17,000 Tbps by 2020[1]. Service providers will continue to be under pressure to deliver rapid, low-latency and high-volume communication of information. This has been especially important to enterprises which are increasingly adopting cloud-managed enterprise connectivity to reduce costs while increasing control and flexibility.
 
Virtually every company in the connected world has either decided on, or is actively formulating, their cloud strategy. In this process, the network is taking on a new level of importance. As the underlying infrastructure evolves to support cloud, we at Juniper Networks believe a new standard of networking is here: cloud-grade networking.

When Acquisitions Lead to Uncertainty




by


Mike Marcellin

		

	
		on 
‎04-24-2017
08:00 AM




















In the high-tech vendor world, oftentimes acquisitions can be exciting for customers. When related technologies come together, it can create unique opportunities to blend products, simplify procurement, and collapse support and services contracts under a single supplier. But when assets are sold under duress, the outcomes can be more uncertain.

Skills Transformation Through Juniper’s OpenLab Throwdown




by


jerry p

		

	
		on 
‎03-30-2017
08:00 AM




















Imagine a world where predictive, automated and network-based mega-services adapt to user behavior, enabling better decision-making and enriching personal and business lives. In this world of tomorrow, network engineers will spend more time developing next-generation software than they do physically configuring routers and switches. At Juniper Networks, we call this an era of Digital Cohesion and businesses are quickly approaching this new frontier.
 
To support this era, communications service providers will need to re-examine the way they architect their networks. As the technology landscape evolves, networking engineers are required to develop new skillsets to keep up with emerging responsibilities and a transforming industry. That’s where Juniper’s OpenLab comes into play. OpenLab’s programs offer the current and future IT workforce the tools and hands-on education they need to propel their expertise to stay ahead of the changing tech landscape.

A Message from Juniper Networks’ Founder, Pradeep Sindhu




by


Pradeep Sindhu

		

	
		on 
‎02-06-2017
01:30 PM




















As many of you know, I have always had a passion for solving large, complex problems that have broad industry applicability. One of the biggest challenges facing the high tech industry today is how to make radical improvements to the economics, security, and reliability of cloud data centers given the slowdown of Moore's Law and the progressive increase in the ratio of communication to computation for contemporary applications. This is the reason I founded Fungible in 2015.
 
I am equally passionate about the success of Juniper Networks, the company I founded in 1996.

Beauty Within: Reinventing Software Development at Juniper Networks

How you do things matters just as much as what you build. If you look internally and see acceptance of the ordinary, apathy, or stagnation, it’s only a matter of time for it to reflect in your products and value. So, when we decided to proactively redefine how we build software at Juniper, it was a major initiative, but not uncharacteristic. After all, it makes us better on the inside.

Announcing Juniper’s Planned Acquisition of AppFormix

As we have worked on large-scale deployments of hybrid clouds with SaaS providers and NFV with telecom service providers, we realize at Juniper Networks that some of the biggest obstacles to adoption and growth of these environments are operations and workload management.
 
As hybrid cloud and NFV solutions mature, the day-one experience has become fairly smooth. While there are many software components that must come together to create an orchestration stack, the market is standardizing, and we are tackling the deployment problem through automation and systems integrations efforts with our partners like Red Hat, Canonical, and Mirantis.

At last week’s annual Juniper Networks’ customer conference, NXTWORK, our CEO Rami Rahim struck a chord with the audience and media when he laid out a vision for the not-so-distant future: a world of Digital Cohesion. This new era can be described as a world in which applications connect and self-assemble in a way that will enhance our lives.
 
We hear a lot about digital disruption and digital transformation. But what sets Digital Cohesion apart is that it goes beyond point services to holistic mega-services and that these services are anticipatory and adaptive based on the amazing work happening around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

ENTERPRISE

Juniper acquires networking company BTI Systems

Image Credit: Mark Doliner/Flickr 





Juniper Networks, a major player in the world of data center networking hardware, announced today that it has acquired BTI Systems, a company with hardware and software-defined networking (SDN) tools. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
BTI specializes in cloud and metro networking — specifically to move content to and from multiple data centers within a close geographical area, such as a city.
“We expect the acquisition will allow Juniper to accelerate the delivery of open and automated packet optical transport solutions that integrate with our NorthStar Controller and include network management features that enable end-to-end provisioning of new services,” Juniper executive vice president and general manager Jonathan Davidson wrote in a blog post.
The deal could help Juniper compete more with Cisco and Arista, especially when it comes to the service provider market. In 2012 Juniper acquired SDN startup Contrail for $176 million.
Founded in 2000 and based in Ottawa, Canada, BTI has raised $60 million in funding, according to the Boston Business Journal. Investors include Bain Capital Ventures, BDC, Covington Capital, GrowthWorks, Export Development Canada (EDC), Fujitsu Network Communications, and Kodiak Venture Partners.
BTI’s website says the company had 380 customers, including Equinix, Interxion, Rackspace, and VKontakte.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

LLC or Incorporation?

Click here to see our comparison chart




The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.
