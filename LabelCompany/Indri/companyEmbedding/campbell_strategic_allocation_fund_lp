Investigation: Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


Investigation: Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund
Fitapelli Kurta is currently investigating complaints related to the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund.  From 2003 to 2012, more than 15,000 investors put a total of $4.5 billion into the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund.  During that same period, the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund earned $2.43 billion, according to SEC filings, however those returns were reduced to only $158.8 million after investors paid an incredible $2.27 billion in fees.  In total, 93% of the gains were paid in fees.
The Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund was marketed and sold by the following broker-dealers: Prospera Financial Services, Inc., Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Tricor Financial LLC, Polar Investment Counsel, Inc., Girard Securities, Inc., Campbell Financial Services, Inc. and LPL Financial. The Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund is a type of investment fund known as a “managed future fund.”  Many brokers promote managed futures, such as Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, as protection against market declines.  However, the language in the prospectuses for these types of funds is not consistent with that notion.  In reality, managed future funds, like Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, are “noncorrelated,” which means that their performance does not track that of any other investments.  This is not understood by many investors.

“A previously highly successful model often becomes outdated and inaccurate, sometimes without Campbell & Co. recognizing that fact before substantial losses are incurred.” – Campbell  Strategic Allocation Fund, Annual Report

Managed-futures funds, such as the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, are a subset of hedge funds. The funds are run by commodity-trading advisers, or CTAs.   Although most hedge funds typically charge a 2 percent management fee, managed-futures funds often charge clients 7 to 9 percent of assets invested annually.
If you or someone you know invested in the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, please contact us today for a free consultation and evaluation of your complaint. Do not delay.

THE FUTURES, FORWARD AND SWAP MARKETS




FUTURES CONTRACTS



Futures contracts are standardized agreements traded on commodity exchanges
that call for the future delivery of the commodity or financial instrument at a
specified time and place. A futures trader that enters into a contract to take
delivery of the underlying commodity is "long" the contract, or has "bought" the
contract. A trader that is obligated to make delivery is "short" the contract or
has "sold" the contract. Actual delivery on the contract rarely occurs. Futures
traders usually offset (liquidate) their contract obligations by entering into
equal but offsetting futures positions. For example, a trader who is long one
September Treasury bond contract on the Chicago Board of Trade can offset the
obligation by entering into a short position in a September Treasury bond
contract on that exchange. Futures positions that have not yet been liquidated
are known as "open" contracts or positions.


Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities, including
agricultural products, metals, livestock products, government securities,
currencies and stock market indices. Options on futures contracts are also
traded on U.S. commodity exchanges. The Fund concentrates its futures trading in
financial instruments such as interest rate, foreign exchange and stock index
contracts, and metal and energy contracts.



FORWARD CONTRACTS



Currencies and other commodities may be purchased or sold for future
delivery or cash settlement through banks or dealers pursuant to forward or swap
contracts. Currencies also can be traded pursuant to futures contracts on
organized futures exchanges; however, Campbell & Company will use the dealer
market in foreign exchange contracts for most of the Fund's trading in
currencies. Such dealers will act as "principals" in these transactions and will
include their profit in the price quoted on the contracts. Unlike futures
contracts, foreign exchange contracts are not standardized. In addition, the
forward market is largely unregulated. Forward contracts are not "cleared" or
guaranteed by a third party. Thus, the Fund is subject to the creditworthiness
of ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., Chicago Branch, the foreign exchange dealer with whom it
maintains all assets and positions relating to the Fund's forward contract
investments. There also is no daily settlement of unrealized gains or losses on
open foreign exchange contracts as there is with futures contracts on U.S.
exchanges.



SWAP TRANSACTIONS



The Fund may periodically enter into transactions in the forward or other
markets which could be characterized as swap transactions and which may involve
interest rates, currencies, securities interests, commodities and other items. A
swap transaction is an individually negotiated, non-standardized agreement
between two parties to exchange cash flows measured by different interest rates,
exchange rates, or prices, with payments calculated by reference to a principal
("notional") amount or quantity. Transactions in these markets present risks
similar to those in the futures, forward and options markets:


(1) the swap markets are generally not regulated by any United States or
foreign governmental authorities;


(2) there are generally no limitations on daily price moves in swap
transactions;


(3) speculative position limits are not applicable to swap transactions,
although the counterparties with which the Fund may deal may limit the
size or duration of positions available as a consequence of credit
considerations;


(4) participants in the swap markets are not required to make continuous
markets in swaps contracts; and


(5) the swap markets are "principal markets," in which performance with
respect to a swap contract is the responsibility only of the
counterparty with which the trader has entered into a contract (or its
guarantor, if any), and not of any exchange or clearinghouse. As a
result, the Fund will be subject to the risk of the inability of or
refusal to perform with respect to such contracts on the part of the
counterparties with which the Fund trades.


The CFTC has adopted Part 35 to its Rules which provides non-exclusive safe
harbor treat-


1





ment from regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act as amended for swap
transactions which meet specified criteria, over which the CFTC will not
exercise its jurisdiction and regulate as futures or commodity option
transactions. Notwithstanding the CFTC's position, the CFTC or a court could
conclude in the future that certain swap transactions entered into by the Fund
constitute unauthorized futures or commodity option contracts subject to the
CFTC's jurisdiction or attempt to prohibit the Fund from engaging in such
transactions. If the Fund were restricted in its ability to trade in the swap
markets, the activities of Campbell & Company, to the extent that it trades in
such markets on behalf of the Fund, might be materially affected.



REGULATION



The U.S. futures markets are regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act,
which is administered by the CFTC, a federal agency created in 1974. The CFTC
licenses and regulates commodity exchanges, commodity pool operators, commodity
trading advisors and clearing firms which are referred to in the futures
industry as "futures commission merchants." Campbell & Company is licensed by
the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor. Futures
professionals are also regulated by the NFA, a self-regulatory organization for
the futures industry that supervises the dealings between futures professionals
and their customers. If the pertinent CFTC licenses or NFA memberships were to
lapse, be suspended or be revoked, Campbell & Company would be unable to act as
the Fund's commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor.


The CFTC has adopted disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping requirements
for commodity pool operators and disclosure and recordkeeping requirements for
commodity trading advisors. The reporting rules require pool operators to
furnish to the participants in their pools a monthly statement of account,
showing the pool's income or loss and change in net asset value, and an annual
financial report, audited by an independent certified public accountant.


The CFTC and the exchanges have pervasive powers over the futures markets,
including the emergency power to suspend trading and order trading for
liquidation of existing positions only. The exercise of such powers could
adversely affect the Fund's trading.


The CFTC does not regulate forward contracts. Federal and state banking
authorities also do not regulate forward trading or forward dealers. Trading in
foreign currency futures contracts may be less liquid and the Fund's trading
results may be adversely affected.



MARGIN



The Fund will use margin in its trading. In order to establish and maintain
a futures position, a trader must make a type of good-faith deposit with its
broker, known as "margin," of approximately 2%-10% of contract value. Minimum
margins are established for each futures contract by the exchange on which the
contract is traded. The exchanges alter their margin requirements from time to
time, sometimes significantly. For their protection, clearing brokers may
require higher margins from their customers than the exchange minimums. Margin
also is deposited in connection with forward contracts but is not required by
any applicable regulation.


There are two types of margin. "Initial" margin is the amount a trader is
required to deposit with its broker to open a futures position. The other type
of margin is "maintenance" margin. When the contract value of a trader's futures
position falls below a certain percentage, typically about 75%, of its value
when the trader established the position, the trader is required to deposit
additional margin in an amount equal to the loss in value.

The managed futures industry market sector distributions presented above
include both speculative and hedging transactions, as well as options on
futures. The charts were prepared by Campbell & Company using data obtained from
the Futures Industry Association. The charts show the change in market
concentration from 1980 to 1999. In 1980 the agricultural sector dominated most
managed futures allocations. However, by 1999 the agricultural sector made up
only a small portion of the total trading volume, with financial instruments
such as interest rates, stock indices and currencies representing the dominant
portion of trading. A significant portion of currency trading is done in the
forward rather than in the futures markets, and, accordingly, is not reflected
in the foregoing chart.


Please note that the pie charts above and the bar chart below reflect the
trading volume for the managed futures industry as a whole, and are not
indicative of the Fund in particular.

INVESTMENT FACTORS




THE ADVANTAGES OF NON-CORRELATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF YOUR PORTFOLIO



The Nobel Prize for Economics in 1990 was awarded to Dr. Harry Markowitz
for demonstrating that the total return can increase, and/or risk can be
reduced, when portfolios have positively performing asset categories that are
essentially non-correlated. Even many seemingly diverse portfolios may actually
be quite correlated. For instance, over time, alternative investment classes
such as real estate investment vehicles and international stocks and bonds may
correlate closely with domestic equities as the global economy expands and
contracts.


Historically, managed futures investments have had very little correlation
to the stock and bond markets. Campbell & Company believes that the performance
of the Fund should also exhibit a substantial degree of non-correlation (not,
however, necessarily negative correlation) with the performance of traditional
equity and debt portfolio components, in part because of the ease of selling
futures short. This feature of futures -- being able to be long or short a
futures position with similar ease -- means that profit and loss from futures
trading, unlike many debt and equity instruments, is not dependent upon economic
prosperity or stability.


However, non-correlation will not provide any diversification advantages
unless the non-correlated assets are outperforming other portfolio assets, and
there is no guarantee that the Fund will outperform other sectors of an
investor's portfolio (or not produce losses). Additionally, although adding
managed futures funds to a portfolio may provide diversification, managed
futures funds are not a hedging mechanism and there is no guarantee that managed
futures funds will appreciate during periods of inflation or stock and bond
market declines.


Non-correlated performance should not be confused with negatively
correlated performance. Non-correlation means only that the Fund's performance
will likely have no relation to the performance of equity and debt instruments,
reflecting Campbell & Company's belief that factors that affect equity and debt
prices may affect the Fund differently and that certain factors which affect the
former may not affect the latter. The net asset value per unit may decline or
increase more or less than equity and debt instruments during both rising and
falling cash markets. Campbell & Company has no expectation that the Fund's
performance will be negatively correlated to general debt and equity markets,

i.e., likely to be profitable when the latter are unprofitable, or vice versa.



ADVANTAGES OF FUTURES FUND INVESTMENTS



Both the futures, forward and swap markets and funds investing in those
markets offer many structural advantages that make managed futures an efficient
way to participate in global markets.



PROFIT POTENTIAL



Futures and related contracts can easily be leveraged, which magnifies the
potential profit and loss. As a result of this leveraging, even a small movement
in the price of a contract can cause major losses.



100% INTEREST CREDIT



Unlike some alternative investment funds, the Fund does not borrow money in
order to obtain leverage, so the Fund does not incur any interest expense.
Rather, the Fund's margin deposits are maintained in cash equivalents, such as
U.S. Treasury bills, and interest is earned on 100% of the Fund's available
assets, which include unrealized profits credited to the Fund's accounts.



GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION WITHIN A SINGLE INVESTMENT



Futures and related contracts can be traded in many countries, which makes
it possible to diversify risk around the world. This diversification is
available both geographically and across market sectors. For example, an
investor can trade interest rates, stock indices and currencies in several
countries around the world, as well as energy and metals. While the Fund itself
trades across a diverse selection of global markets, an investment in the Fund
is not a substitute for overall portfolio diversification.



ABILITY TO PROFIT OR LOSE IN A RISING OR FALLING MARKET ENVIRONMENT



The Fund can establish short positions and thereby profit from declining
markets as easily as it can establish long positions. This potential to


4





make money, whether markets are rising or falling around the globe, makes
managed futures particularly attractive to sophisticated investors. Of course,
if markets go higher while an investor has a short position, he will lose money
until the short position is exited.



PROFESSIONAL TRADING



Campbell & Company is one of the world's largest and most experienced
commodity trading advisors. Campbell & Company's approach includes the following
elements:


- Disciplined Money Management.  Campbell & Company generally allocates
between 1% and 5% of portfolio equity to any single market position.
However, no guarantee is provided that losses will be limited to these
percentages.


- Balanced Risk.  Campbell & Company will allocate the Fund's capital to
more than 50 markets around the world 24 hours a day. Among the factors
considered for determining the portfolio mix are market volatility,
liquidity and trending characteristics.


- Capital Management.  When proprietary risk/reward indicators reach
predetermined levels, Campbell & Company may increase or decrease
commitments in certain markets in an attempt to reduce performance
volatility.


- Multiple Systems.  While Campbell & Company's approach is to find
emerging trends and follow them to conclusion, no one system is right all
of the time. Campbell & Company utilizes a multi-system strategy on
behalf of the Fund that divides capital among different trading systems
in an attempt to reduce performance volatility.


Campbell & Company received advisory fees in exchange for these services.



CONVENIENCE



Through the Fund, investors can participate in global markets and
opportunities without needing to master complex trading strategies and monitor
multiple international markets.



LIQUIDITY



In most cases the underlying markets have sufficient liquidity. Some
markets trade 24 hours on business days. While there can be cases where there
may be no buyer or seller for a particular contract, the Fund tries to select
markets for investment based upon, among other things, their perceived
liquidity. Exchanges impose limits on the amount that a futures price can move
in one day. Situations in which markets have moved the limit for several days in
a row have not been common, but do occur. See "The Risks You Face -- Your
Investment Could be Illiquid."


Generally, investors may redeem all or a portion of their units on a
monthly basis, subject to a declining redemption fee during the first year. See
"Distributions and Redemptions."



LIMITED LIABILITY



Investors' liability is limited to the amount of their investment in the
Fund. Investors will not be required to contribute additional capital to the
Fund.

HISTORICAL CORRELATION



The chart below shows the historical correlation of the monthly returns of
the NASDAQ Composite Index, EAFE Index, Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index
and MAR Fund/Pool Qualified Universe Index with the S&P 500 Index. Note that
stocks associated with the NASDAQ and EAFE indices, as well as bonds, have
historically had a higher correlation with the S&P 500 Index than managed
futures, as represented by the MAR Index. This low correlation shows that
managed futures have a tendency to behave somewhat independently from stocks.

VOLATILITY COMPARISON



A common measure of risk is standard deviation of monthly returns. Standard
deviation measures the variability of returns around the average return for that
particular investment. Generally the higher the standard deviation, the higher
the volatility. Shown below are three comparisons of volatility: overall, upside
and downside.


Overall volatility is the most common measure of volatility or risk. Upside
volatility measures the volatility of only the profitable months. Downside
volatility shows the volatility of only the unprofitable months. Investors are
typically more concerned with downside volatility, which is perhaps a better
historical indication of the risk of actually losing money. As can be seen from
the chart, managed futures (MAR) have shown comparable upside volatility and
less downside volatility than the other benchmarks with the exception of bonds.
There is no guarantee that this low downside volatility will persist into the
future, nor is this representative of future returns through an investment in
the Fund.

RISK PERSPECTIVE



The proper evaluation of any investment must include an assessment of the
risk which must be taken to achieve the prospective return. Another measure of
risk, in addition to standard deviation, is historical worst-case decline, or
largest draw-down. In other words, if you had purchased an investment at a
month-end peak in performance and then subsequently sold at the lowest month-end
price thereafter, the worst case decline would be the largest percentage loss
experienced. The chart below shows the worst case cumulative monthly decline in
the Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index, MAR Index, S&P 500 Index, EAFE Index
and NASDAQ Composite Index since 1980. The MAR Index experienced a smaller peak
to valley decline than three out of the remaining indices. This does not imply
that managed futures are necessarily safer than the benchmarks compared; it is
merely intended to put risk in a historical perspective.

VALUE OF DIVERSIFICATION -- CAMPBELL STRATEGIC ALLOCATION FUND




PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.




THE EFFECT OF INCREASING ALLOCATIONS OF MANAGED FUTURES IN A PORTFOLIO



The chart below shows the effect of allocating increasing percentages of
the Fund into a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds. Beginning with a
portfolio made up of 40% bonds and 60% stocks, the Fund was added in 5%
increments while the bond allocation was decreased by the same percentage. As
the allocation of the Fund increased up to approximately 20%, returns increased
and standard deviation, one measure of risk, was reduced. If more than 20% of
the Fund was introduced, returns continued to increase, but risk increased as
well. The foregoing chart does not constitute a recommendation that anyone
invest more than 10% of their net worth, which is the maximum allocation allowed
by the prospectus, in the Fund. Both the increase in return and reduction of
risk generated by additional allocations to the Fund in excess of the 10%
allocation allowed represent only incremental improvements to the overall
portfolio. Prospective investors must keep in mind that the benefits illustrated
by the foregoing chart are only evident during periods in which managed futures
(represented by the Fund) outperform stocks or bonds. There can be no assurance
that the Fund will outperform stocks or bonds during any particular investment
cycle.

This chart, prepared by Campbell & Company, contains historical trading results
hypothetically blended. The stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index and
bonds are represented by the Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index. See the
glossary following this section for information integral to this chart.


HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF
WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL
OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE
ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND
THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.


ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE
GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL
TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN
COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING
PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY
AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE
MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM
WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL
PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING
RESULTS.

CORRELATION OF MONTHLY RETURNS



The more similarly two markets behave, the higher their correlation.
Generally, asset allocation models attempt to reduce volatility by combining
instruments that behave differently from one another. The first chart shows the
correlation between the S&P 500 Index and various stock, bond and managed
futures indices. The second chart shows the correlation between the Fund and the
same indices. The first chart used the S&P 500 Index as the benchmark for
comparison, while the second chart uses the Fund as the benchmark against which
the others are correlated. Managed futures have historically had a lower
correlation with the S&P 500 Index than the S&P 500 Index has had with other
stock and bond indices. This does not mean that the Fund is a hedge for a stock
portfolio, but merely that the returns of each may be somewhat independent of
the other.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS



These charts show that, historically, the Fund's returns are not negatively
correlated with stocks and bonds, but rather perform independently from stocks
and bonds. As displayed below, in a small percentage of time, the Fund and
stocks and bonds have experienced losses simultaneously. In a larger percentage
of time, the Fund has had positive returns during periods when stocks and bonds
were also experiencing positive performance. However, in over 40% of the 75
months represented in these charts, performance of the Fund and stocks and bonds
have moved in opposite directions.

VOLATILITY COMPARISON (APRIL 1994 -- JUNE 2000)



A common measure of risk is standard deviation, which measures the
variability of returns around the average return for that specific investment.
Generally the higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility or risk.
A comparison of overall volatility (measured by standard deviation) of monthly
returns for the Fund, EAFE Index, S&P 500 Index and NASDAQ Composite Index is
shown in the first chart below. Notice that the volatility for the Fund has been
declining in recent years, while that of some of the stock indices has been
rising. During the last three years, the Fund has had lower volatility than
equity indices. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future
results, and there is no guarantee that such low volatility will persist into
the future. Upside volatility measures the volatility of only the profitable
months. Downside volatility measures the volatility of only the unprofitable
months. Investors are typically more concerned with downside volatility, which
is perhaps a better historical indicator of the risk of actually losing money.
The second chart compares the upside volatility for the Fund, the EAFE Index,
the S&P 500 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index. The third chart compares
downside volatility for the Fund and the same indices. Campbell & Company
believes that prospective investors should note that the Fund has had less
downside volatility, in most cases, when compared to equity indices. Once again,
there is no guarantee that this low volatility will persist into the future.

RISK PERSPECTIVE



The proper evaluation of any investment must include an assessment of the
risk which must be taken to achieve the prospective return. Another measure of
risk, in addition to standard deviation, is historical worst-case decline, or
largest draw-down. In other words, if you had purchased an investment at a
month-end peak in performance and then subsequently sold at the lowest month-end
price thereafter, the worst-case decline would be the largest percentage loss
experienced. The chart below shows the worst-case cumulative monthly decline in
the EAFE Index, S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Fund since the
Fund's inception in 1994.

THE CHANGING INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE



The table below charts the annual rates of returns for various indices or
asset categories and illustrates that all sectors behave differently from year
to year. An index or asset category that is ranked at the top one year may be
ranked toward the bottom in subsequent years. The Fund is intended to be a
medium- to long-term investment. No one can predict which sectors are likely to
outperform the others during any specific period in the future.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS




BONDS




LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT BOND INDEX*


Composed of bonds that are investment grade (as rated by Moody's or
Standard & Poor's). Issues must have at least one year to maturity. Total return
comprises price appreciation/depreciation and income as a percentage of the
original investment. Indexes are rebalanced monthly by market capitalization.



MANAGED FUTURES




BARCLAY COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR (CTA) INDEX


Measures the composite performance of established CTAs (those with four or
more years of documented performance history). Once a CTA passes this four-year
hurdle mark, its subsequent performance is included in this non-weighted index.



CAMPBELL STRATEGIC ALLOCATION FUND


The Fund, which began trading in April 1994, is an actively managed account
with speculative trading profits as its objective. Performance information for
the Fund is net of all fees and commissions.



MAR FUND/POOL QUALIFIED UNIVERSE INDEX


A dollar weighted index that includes the performance of current as well as
retired public futures funds, private pools and offshore funds that have the
objective of speculative trading profits. The MAR Index is utilized as a broad
measure of overall managed futures returns, as compared to other indices that
measure the overall returns of stocks and bonds as separate asset classes. The
MAR Index is not the same as an investment in the Fund, and the Fund may perform
quite differently than the Index, just as an individual stock may perform quite
differently from the S&P 500 Index.



STOCKS




DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE*


A price weighted average of 30 stocks selected by Dow Jones & Company.
Because it is price weighted (as opposed to capitalization weighted) the stocks
in the Index with the highest prices have the biggest effect on the performance
of the Index.



MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL EUROPE, AUSTRALASIA, FAR EAST INDEX (EAFE)*


A cap weighted index that is designed to measure the investment returns of
developed economies outside of North America. The Index includes publicly traded
stocks from 21 countries that are divided into industry groups and then
representative stocks are selected from each industry group. In addition,
cross-ownership is tracked to ensure that the market weight given each company
is accurate.



NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX*


Measures all NASDAQ domestic and non-U.S. based common stocks listed on the
NASDAQ Stock Market (currently over 5,000 companies). The Index is market-value
weighted. This means that each company's security affects the Index in
proportion to its market value. The market value, the last sale price multiplied
by total shares outstanding, is calculated throughout the trading day, and is
related to the total value of the Index.



STANDARD & POOR'S 500 COMPOSITE STOCK INDEX (S&P 500 INDEX)*


The 500 stocks in the S&P 500 are chosen by Standard and Poor's based on
industry representation, liquidity and stability. The stocks in the S&P 500 are
not the 500 largest companies, but an index designed to capture the returns of
many different sectors of the U.S. economy.




* Passive, unmanaged indices of equity and debt securities generally purchased
by investors with an investment objective of capital preservation, growth or
income.
