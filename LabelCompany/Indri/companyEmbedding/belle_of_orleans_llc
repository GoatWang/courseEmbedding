The motto of the La Belle Beauty Salon is Where Beauty begins and never ends. This mission is carried out through providing each guest with a unique and personalized experience. The stylists at the La Belle Beauty Salon strive to enhance our client’s natural beauty provided in our comfortable and relaxing environment.
LaBelle’s Beauty Salon was founded by Dr.Isabelle Mandy Gant of New Orleans Louisiana over 50 years ago. This Lafayette location is one of the oldest standing independently owned salons in the state of Louisiana. She was granted to open a higher learning facility in the southwest area of the state by the Governor and Lafayette was her target. LaBelle’s  first opened in the late 60′s as a beauty school. Where she educated her students on professionalism as well as cosmetology. The school would be converted into a full service salon in the  80′s by her oldest daughter Dr. Jo Ann Mildred Gant. Dr. Gant was also the founder behind New Orleans own Afro House, was elected as president of  LSBBA, served on the city council for Orleans and Lafayette parish and would continue to give back to her community until her passing in 2004.

The toughest and best decision of all wedding planning











Reviewed on

Laura R


I consider myself a pretty laid back person and so I believe I was not a bridezilla during the wedding planning. I do confess however, that I almost lost my calm and collected self when it was time to choose a wedding photographer. It was so stressful because I thought if... Read More
 food, decoration, entertainment or anything else is "ok", everyone, including myself, would forget about it months after the wedding. Now a photographer would capture the moments that you could re-live for the rest of your life and generations to come from your union. I searched and searched, had meeting after meetings until I met Nichole Manning, owner and photographer of Belle Amour Photography. For some reason she made me feel very secure about my decision to go with them. Their work looked beautiful, she seemed passionate about her job and I felt her she really listened to what I envisioned. Today, 4 months after I said "I do" I can say that going with Nichole was the best decision ever! She was attentive to details, came to the church a few weeks before for a meeting with me and the wedding coordinator at St. Patrick's, checked with me every couple of days before the wedding, was on time, brought an incredible 2nd photographer and was very pleasant all day long. Not to pushy, but with great simple ideas. I am writing this review I am having the most difficult time choosing the pictures to print out of the 1,500 Belle Amour took. One captures a sweeter, more emotional, beautiful moment than the other. For most of my family that are in Brazil and couldn't be there have said that when they saw the pictures, they felt like they were there. Enough said. If you are looking for a photographer for your wedding, look no further.




I love my pictures!!!

My sister and I both booked with Nicole after our first meeting with her. She was very quick to respond and very professional. Two engagement shoots, 2 boudoir shoots, and two weddings later...we couldn't be happier with our choice of photographer! She is an amazing photographer... Read More
 and can honestly work magic! Not only does she have the skill set but she genuinely loves what she does! She's personable, is always there to answer your questions, and gives great advice along the way. One thing I loved most is I didn't feel like I had to do the research and find the poses I wanted. She's great at telling you how to pose, when to smile, what direction to turn your eyes, etc. She also has an eye for natural shots and knows exactly when to have the lend ready to capture the genuine shots. She has a second photographer Wendy who's assists her with the weddings who is just as great! I would highly recommend Belle Amour! They have gained a forever family! I plan to use her as a family photographer to do any shoots I may want in the future. Thank you Belle Amour for providing me with lifetime memories!

I am so happy with my wedding photos! The price was very reasonable for such quality work. Plus, I got a few free prints and digital copies of my photos on a lovely custom flash drive. I met with Nichole and booked Belle Amour almost a year in advance. We had a nice chat about... Read More
 my nontraditional ceremony and what I was looking for. She did not disappoint. I explained that there would be low lighting at my reception and she is the only photographer I talked to that did not flinch when hearing this. Not only was she able to perfectly capture the lighting, but she was even able to get shots of fireworks lighting up the sky! I am no expert, but I am sure that is not easy to do. She is very skilled in her craft. One of the things that first attracted me to her photos was the amazing still images she had on her website of table décor, bridal accessories, etc. I told her I was interested in getting lots of shots like this and she was very creative and passionate in doing so - she positioned our wedding rings on our cake topper and hung my dress from a mossy tree. I really loved working with someone who is genuinely excited about her work. I it not just a job to her. Thank you Nichole!

We found Nichole on the knot.com, and she already had favorable reviews. So, here one more to add to that - Nichole was great! She met with us a few times before the wedding to review all relevant details and to make sure she knew the schedule of events and types of pictures we... Read More

On the wedding day, she and her assistant showed up on time and were able to manage through all of our families and guests for pictures.

My husband and I were very thankful for Nicole, especially after our wedding. With so many things that went terribly wrong at our wedding, we were thrilled to get the pictures and see all of the good things that happened and how happy everyone was. She even fixed some of the... Read More
 mistakes that weren't her responsibility. We loved how down to earth and helpful she was. She took beautiful photos and we will cherish them forever. Our one big problem that we had was adding a second photographer. Although she got some great shots from the balcony at our ceremony, neither photographer took a single photograph of our outdoor reception area. Our reception was at a yacht club with a huge balcony. Many people stayed outside because of the beautiful weather that day. They aren't in a single picture. There were also no pictures taken of anything but the dance floor. We have no pictures of our food, bar, or anyone sitting at tables. We can't turn back time though. Overall, I really liked Nicole and her style of photography. I guess just make sure you let her and the second shooter know exactly what you want photographed.

My Husband and I were married April 12, 2014. I remember before we were engaged, I (Olivia) thought I had everything planned out. I was surprised when I realized that the planning process isn't as easy as you think it is. This is mainly because I am SO indecisive. Anyways, one... Read More
 decision I made that I never felt the need to reconsider was choosing Belle Amour Photography to capture our day. Nikki made Jeff and I feel so comfortable throughout the entire process. From our engagement session, to my bridals and up until the big day everything was just so easy. I seriously do not know how she does it. I would tell her thoughts and ideas of what I was expecting and she always went above and beyond. She seemed to know exactly what we wanted without us having to find the words to explain it. I could not have asked for a better experience than what we had with Belle Amour Photography. Jeff and I are so privileged to have been able to work with Nikki and we are forever grateful for the beautiful pictures we now have to look back on.
