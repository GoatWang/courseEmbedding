You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Kelly Thomas– Chief Engineer of Product Software
Case Study Part I
1. Assumptions:
a. Kelly Thomas– Chief Engineer of Product Software
1. Pat is trying to bypass the authority of Kelly because he is directly communicating with the developers within his staff.
2. Kelly’s point of view with regards to business practices does not coincide with Pat’s perspective.
3. There are difficulties in accomplishing the current workload because of the staff cuts that happened before.
4. Kelly deems that he does not have the available staff that would work in the development of a prototype by the deadline in August.
5. Kelly is receiving pressure from his superior to produce a prototype despite the fact that there is a lack of resources to accomplish the existing work and more so, with the additional product in the development list.
6. Kelly does not agree with the budget allocation and timeline, as he perceives it as unrealistic.
            b. Pat Lambert – Director of Marketing
1. The company needs to develop new products that will cater to a larger market for it to succeed in the marketplace.
2. The scanning technology will be use by specific retail operations as well as other operations by scanning shoppers at the stores that will aid in acquiring information based upon the shoppers’ movement as well as make reports on shopping habits.
3. The product development is minimal as a hardware and software technology, which has been developed and tested.
4. The new product needs to enter the market before the company’s competitors, which needs a quick turnaround in development and implementation.
5. The delay in the launching of a complete product will be costly and it will hinder the chance to capture the market with this new kind of technology.
6. There is a need for the hiring of more contractors in order to work on the existing development and meet the deadline.
7. It will be an additional cost and will reduce the first year ROI. Nevertheless, the capital investment will pay for itself in the span of 10 years because the product will be used and it only needs little additional investment.
8. Pat deems that the development team hinders rather than help the progress of bringing Operations Optimize in the market.
9. Pat feels that Kelly is not giving her enough support.
            c. Cliff O’ Connor – CEO AcuScan
1. There is lack of robustness in the company and we need to address it by recapturing the market.
2. Budget-cuts have to be made in order to achieve the company’s goal.
3. The development of new products is a necessity in order increase the company’s market share and profit.
4. Pat Lambert and Chris Marinas are collaborating together in order to develop a product that will help the company in increasing its market share.
            d. Chris Marinas – Vice President of Product Development
1. The development department is undergoing a lot of pressure in order to perform and cut costs.
2. The department needs to cut costs by 15%.
3. They need to think of ways to cut-costs without laying-off employees.
4. Chris has left the issues of getting the product into the market between Kelly and Pat because he believes that it is their responsibility.
2. Explanation of Arguments
a.       Cliff O’Connor – Since Cliff is the CEO of AcuScan, it is understandable that his
 primary objective is the company’s growth and profitability. The company’s market shares are decreasing because their products are only limited to specific markets and it is becoming a commodity. Cliff’s responsibility is to improve the situation of the company despite the reaction of the employees about the changes that needs to be done. In relation to this, he also has the task of maintaining the costs within the budget. As such, he decided that the new development should be completed at less than 2/3 of the estimated costs and he also refuse to extend the deadline.
a.       Pat Lambert – Being the newly employed Marketing Director, Pat has the task to
give ideas that will aid the company to become more profitable. She has limited resources but still needs to accomplish the objectives that she believes will help the company. Pat deems that using existing technology in the retail market can work to create a new product for the market. She is convinced that the Product Development group should work with her plan and timeline.
b.      Kelly Thomas – Being the Director of Development, Kelly is responsible in
managing the existing work that he has with the company as well as think of ways on how to use the resources to sustain existing customers. He also has to see to it that the products he creates are built to perform as expected. Since the resources are already consumed to its full capacity, he is having difficulties in meeting the new development plan made by Pat Lambert. Kelly believes that expecting the limited resources to maintain current business contracts and also develop a new product is irrational and impossible.
            d. Chris Martinas – Being the Vice President of Product Development, he must operate in accordance with the objectives of the CEO as well as the current realities of his work environment. The company’s decreasing profitability must be address but he wants to do it without laying-off employees. He has to manage the existing budget and staff resources and at the same time, finding ways to develop new products. The first step that he made is the suggestion for each department to cut their expenses by 15%. He left the decision on the department managers to think of ways for cost cutting in their area.
3. Sound or Unsound Arguments
            a. Cliff O’ Connor – He wants to prevent the company from reaching bankruptcy that is why he needs to do the necessary steps in order to increase profits. His argument is logical in nature and sound because he has in mind the best interest and welfare of the whole company. His efforts are designated in leading the company to a better future by directing the company to grow in its field.
            b. Pat Lambert – Pat’s responsibility is to think of innovative ways to utilize the company’s existing technology for different market shares and to develop a new product that will adhere to the demands of an emerging market. Pat has a sound vision of using the existing technology for different markets, which could address the problem of the company’s limited resources. However, she does not have the support of the Product Development. She is also very absorbed with the deadline that she has wherein she is trying to coincide all the necessary agenda into that time frame without giving due consideration to the other components that is needed to accomplish the system that she plans. Pat’s argument is emotional because it is merely based upon her desire to accomplish the goal that she has without giving importance to the other people and department in the company.
            c. Kelly Thomas – He strongly believes that the deadline for the project is unreasonable, as it cannot be completed within that time frame. Kelly was the original developer of the software product and he is becoming to involved in the ways by which the development should be completed. Kelly failed to see other alternatives in his midst like the process of outsourcing. Nevertheless, he has the knowledge and expertise to make the necessary changes in the process because of his previous experience. Kelly’s argument is emotional because he is getting personally attached with the project that hinders him to see new alternatives. It is still logical because he is using his knowledge based upon his experience to understand how the work should be done.
            d. Chris Martinas – He recognizes the conflict between the Marketing Department and Product Development but he is uncertain on the proper thing to do. Chris understands the points of both sides but he does not know how to address the conflict. His argument is logical because he has an objective perspective about the problem and he is not getting emotionally attached with it. Furthermore, Chris deems that the company should immediately cut costs without laying off employees. In this sense, his argument is logical because he is taking into consideration the past action of the company in cutting staff as well as the future goal of improving the company by minimizing costs. He wants to address the problem through the least painful way that is possible.
 4. Fallacious Arguments
a.       Kelly – “My staff cannot possibly get the project done by that date. I do not have
the resources and the project is too large” (University of Phoenix).
b.      Kelly – “Pat has undercut my authority by talking directly to my staff to see if the
work she needs done is feasible” (University of Phoenix).
            c. Pat – “The development of a prototype for a small test market by August should be able to be completed with minimal time and effort on the part of the existing staff” (University of Phoenix).
            d. Pat – “Any delay in the deployment of the prototype and final product will impact the market as a competitor is also working on the development of a similar product in hopes to be the first to capture the market” (University of Phoenix).
Conclusions
1. Problems in the situation.
§  The company is experience a decrease in its profitability and is loosing market shares.
§  The company has limited resources to maintain the existing contracts that it has as well as sustain the development of a new product.
§  The CEO would like to accomplish the Operation Optimize by using only 2/3 of the budget.
2. Data, arguments, and reasoning for each problem
§  Decreasing profitability and loosing market shares – The profits are very low.
Service revenues only contribute 70% of the revenue and new business only provided 30% from last year.
§  Limited resources of the company – The company must balance its existing contracts
and at the same time think of ways to enter new business ventures. This is proven by the e-mail on February 19, 2003 regarding a Meeting from Kelly Thomas.
§  The CEO would like to finish the project by using 2/3 of the estimated budget – The
company lacks the necessary budget to complete the project with the costs given by the Marketing executive. This is clearly proven by the e-mail from Cliff O’Connor on February 18, 2003 regarding the Operation Optimize budget.
3. Underlying problem
            The major dilemma of the company is the conflict between Pat, the new Marketing Executive and Kelly, the Director of Development. Pat has brilliant ideas and is also willing to explore new alternatives in order to accomplish her goals but she wants everything done by the August, which is the deadline. On the other hand, Kelly is challenging Pat’s plan based upon his knowledge and own experience in the development of this software. Kelly was the one who created the flagship product, which is why he knows the in and out of it from the history up to the code.
4. Alternative Solutions
            Solution One: The company should practice the process of outsourcing wherein the will outsource the work for the new development and leave the current staff to work on the existing contracts of the company. They should develop a plan that can utilize an external company to develop the new products form their current technologies together with an exit methodology that involves shifting the development to the existing staff.
            Solution Two: The product should be roll out in stages. The company should get all the critical work done by the existing staff before the launch date by employing standard strategies of development and testing. It is also possible to hire some consultants in order to fill the gaps. The task should be accomplished by phase wherein one stage should be done first before moving to the other one.
 5. Strengths and Weaknesses
            Solution One:
Strength – The process of outsourcing will surely aid with the resource needs and it will also pave the way for the current staff to focus on the company’s existing contracts. This will surely have additional costs but the expense could be justified by the profit that would be gain in the development of a new product.
Weakness – Relying on outsourcing will put the fate of the development of this new technology with people who do not have the working knowledge of the company’s existing infrastructure. The outside resources might overlook important concerns that the company’s employees will surely identify easily. In relation to this, the process of learning by the outside source to familiarize themselves with the system will surely slow down the development process. Moreover, the company’s budget cannot sustain hiring additional consultants.
            Solution Two:
Strength – Designating the project in a series of phases would make sure that product development and testing are properly done. All aspects of development will also work as expected. This kind of plan will allow the existing employees of AcuScan to work on the project, which is very beneficial since they already know the software and they are committed with the success of the company.
Weakness – The finish product will not be available to the market by the time that they expected and the competition might beat them. They might loose their opportunity to improve their company because of their inability to produce a complete project for a new emerging market.
6. Recommended Solution
            Based upon the data gathered from the reports and statements of the officials of the company, the second solution is most applicable. The company does not have the necessary employee to develop the complete project. In line with this, AcuScan does not have the budget to hire a consulting firm. Moreover, giving due consideration with the experience of the Director of Development, even if the company does not have problems with budget or other areas of concern, the project cannot be completed with efficiency, full functionality, and with high standards that AcuScan is known for because of the limited time. Nevertheless, if the company will roll out the operation in stages they could be able to create a stable product that can be brought to the market with additional features that can be added in phases, which will ensure the functionality and efficiency of the product
