Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

				Are you searching for life insurance that fits within your budget? Are you afraid to purchase it because of the cost?        
				
Are you searching for life insurance that fits within your budget? Are you afraid to purchase it because of the cost? If you have procrastinated on purchasing life insurance because you think that you cannot afford it, you may be making a mistake. Everyone has everyday necessary expenses like food and shelter that are often dictated by a budget. A life insurance policy should be a priority among those expenses and it can be affordable. There are very few purchases as important as the security of your family, so how can you afford not to have life insurance? Taking the risk of not having life insurance places your loved ones in potential financial jeopardy.






What would happen to your family if you died unexpectedly? Your loved ones must continue their lives without your financial contribution while unpaid bills and unexpected final expenses begin to mount. Imagine the difficulties and disruption that would be forced upon your family. Would they be able to manage?
Purchasing life insurance can mean purchasing peace of mind. Instead of leaving a financial burden, you can rest assured knowing you will leave your loved ones prepared. You can also give them time to grieve without having to face the pressure of debt and difficult financial obligations. The purchase of an affordable life insurance policy can give your family the gift of security and protection, and in turn, give them time to grieve without unneeded pressure.
Death is a certainty, but a responsible investment like life insurance can be made to ensure families are protected from financial strain and worry. To keep your family financially secure, re-evaluate your budget priorities and move the purchase of a life insurance policy to the top. This is one expense your family cannot afford to be without.

Under the provisions of FATCA, insurers may need to obtain withholding certificates (IRS Forms W-8 or W-9) from their business partners. Typically, a W-8 is provided by non-U.S. entities and a W-9 is provided by U.S. entities. Business partners conducting business with The Hartford may request copies of these completed forms from taxcompliance2@thehartford.com.

 HSD is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act

*Denotes Board of Directors.                                                    

Item 26. Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or    
Registrant
Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the
      Registration Statement File No. 333-119414, filed on March 31, 2005.

Item 27. Number of Contract Owners                                              

As of May 31, 2005, there were 293,239 Contract Owners.       

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

  Sections 33-770 to 33-779, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes provide the standards under which a corporation may  
  indemnify an individual for liability, including legal expenses,
     incurred because such individual is a party to a proceeding because
   the individual was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
corporation. Specifically, Section 33-771(a)(2) permits a     
     corporation to indemnify a director if the corporation, pursuant to
 Section 33-636(b)(5), obligated itself under its certificate of
incorporation to indemnify a director for liability except for
certain liability involving conduct described in Section      
    33-636(b)(5). Section 33-776 permits a corporation to indemnify an
   officer, employee, or agent of the corporation to the same extent
as a director as may be provided by the corporation's bylaws, 
certificate of incorporation, or resolution of the board of   
directors.                                                    

P-->485BPOS10th�Page�of�14TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
     Section 33-771(e) provides that a corporation incorporated prior to
     January 1, 1995, must, except to the extent that the certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise, indemnify a director to the 
     extent that indemnification is permissible under Sections 33-770 to
33-779, inclusive. Section 33-776(d) sets forth a similar     
provision with respect to officers, employees and agents of a 
corporation.                                                  

1.  Based on the statutes referenced above, the Depositor must
indemnify a director if the director:                 

A.  conducted himself in good faith;                  
            B.  reasonably believed (a) in the case of conduct in his official
             capacity, that his conduct was in the best interests of the
                corporation or (b) in all other cases, that his conduct was at
                 least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and
             C.  in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe his conduct was unlawful; or       

   2.  engaged in conduct for which broader indemnification had been
             made permissible or obligatory under a provision of the Depositor's
certificate of incorporation.                         

   In addition, the Depositor must indemnify officers, employees and
agents for liability if the individual:                       

A.  conducted himself in good faith;                  
            B.  reasonably believed (a) in the case of conduct in his official
             capacity, that his conduct was in the best interests of the
                corporation or (b) in all other cases, that his conduct was at
                 least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and
       C.  in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.    

     Section 33-777 permits a corporation to procure insurance on behalf
    of an individual who was a director or officer of the corporation.
Consistent with the statute, the directors and officers of the
Depositor and Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc.  
("HSD") are covered under a directors and officers liability  
insurance policy.                                             

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the  
    Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing
  provisions, or otherwise, the Depositor has been advised that in
the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such    
  indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
     indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
   the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
     or controlling person of the Depositor in the successful defense of
any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, 
 officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
    being registered, the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, 
    submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
     such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in
the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

As a whole  the company is one of the world’s largest insurance and investment companies.  The company has international operations in Japan, Brazil, The UK, Canada and  Ireland. The Hartford Life Insurance subsidiary is a leading provider of life  insurance products, in addition to investment products, annuities, mutual  funds, and college savings plans. Usually referred to as “The Hartford”, the  company was recently named to Wards 2009 Top 50 Life Insurance Providers. 
The Current President and COO of Life Operations is John C.  Walters 
The Company is headquartered in Hartford, CT.
According To the Company
Well known for its Elk Logo, The Hartford Life Insurance  Company provides 10, 15, 20 and 30 year term life insurance polices. In  addition to Term Life, like most mutual life insurance companies, The Hartford  also provides a variety of Permanent Life insurance products to individuals and  businesses. 
The Hartford reminds those interested in life insurance that  the death benefits of life  insurance offer not only piece of mind – but a life insurance policy can be a  key component of a plan for your financial future. Life insurance offers income  protection as well as estate liquidity to protect assets and cover  often-substantial estate taxes. 
Hartford representatives say that no matter your life  circumstances, or whether you are considering Term or Permanent Life insurance  – the earlier you purchase your life insurance policy – the better off you will  be.  If you feel you are in the market  only for Term Life insurance, the younger and healthier you are – the cheaper  you rate will be. If you are interested in the cash value aspects of a Whole  Life insurance option, again the younger you are – the more time you will have  to accumulate the greatest benefit. 
The Hartford Life Insurance Company offers:

Term Life Insurance
Whole Life Insurance
Universal Life Insurances
Variable Life Insurance

HIPAA Privacy Notice





THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN ACCESS THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. 
Hartford Life Insurance Company, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company, and Hartford Life and Annuity Company (collectively “The Hartford” or “we”) are committed to protecting the privacy of your health information.  The Hartford is required by a federal law - the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - to take reasonable steps to ensure the privacy of your “Protected Health Information” (PHI) and to provide you with this Notice of Privacy Practices.  PHI includes all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained by The Hartford and/or its business associates regardless of form (oral, written, electronic). 


This Notice applies to PHI obtained through the following coverages only: Group Retiree Insurance Plan and Medicare Supplement for Employer Groups, Prescription Drug coverage, Disability Income, Hospital Indemnity, Association Medicare Supplement, Medical Conversion, Specified Disease, Cancer, Long-Term Care, Major Medical, Hospital, Medical, and Surgical only.
Effective Date:  This Notice was originally effective April 14, 2003 and as revised is effective September 23, 2013.  If you have any questions about this Notice, or the subjects addressed in it, please call (860) 547-5000.


Uses and Disclosures of Your PHI
This section of the Notice explains how The Hartford uses and discloses your PHI with our employees, business associates, and other organizations as required or permitted by law without your authorization.  We also require our business associates to protect the privacy of your PHI through written agreements with The Hartford.  As explained below, we will request your written authorization in some instances to use or disclose PHI.


Required Disclosures. The use and disclosure of your PHI may be required by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate and/or determine The Hartford’s compliance with HIPAA’s privacy regulations.


Uses and Disclosures Related to Treatment, Payment and Healthcare Operations.  The Hartford and/or its business associates may use and disclose PHI without your authorization or opportunity to agree or object for activities related to treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.  In these instances, The Hartford will not request your authorization to share PHI.  As described in the next section titled Your Privacy Rights, you have the right to request a restriction on the use and disclosure of your PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations purposes.  The Hartford may not use any PHI that is “genetic information” (as defined by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008) for underwriting purposes.  If we use or disclose your protected health information for fundraising activities, we will provide you the choice to opt out of those activities. 


Examples of activities related to treatment include:  treatment provided by a specialist who asks a primary care physician to share a patient’s PHI.


Examples of activities related to payment include:  payment of healthcare claims, determinations whether a member is eligible for healthcare coverage, or collection of premiums.


Examples of activities related to healthcare operations include:  quality improvement; fraud and abuse prevention and detection; case management and medical review; underwriting; and complaint resolution.


Uses and Disclosures of Your PHI That Do Not Require Your Authorization or Opportunity to Object.  Your PHI may be disclosed without your authorization in the following circumstances:  when required by law;public health activities;instances involving victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to a government authority, including a social service or protective services agency, as required or permitted by law;governmental health oversight activities (including audits, investigations, and inspections);judicial and administrative proceedings;certain law enforcement purposes;deceased persons to coroners, health examiners, and funeral directors;organ and tissue donation;certain government-approved research purposes;upon reasonable belief to avert a serious threat to health or safety;specialized government functions (such as military personnel, and inmates in correctional facilities); orworkers’ compensation.


Use and Disclosures to Plan Sponsor.  In some circumstances, The Hartford may also disclose PHI to the sponsor of your group health plan for plan administration functions. 


Use and Disclosure to Contact You Regarding Health-Related Benefits and Services.  The Hartford or its business associates may also contact you regarding health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.


Uses and Disclosures That Require Your Written Authorization.  
In all other circumstances not described above, uses and disclosures of your PHI will only be made with your written authorization.  For example, we will need your authorization for the following circumstances: most uses or disclosures of psychotherapy notes;marketing communications; anddisclosures that constitute a sale of PHI.


You may revoke such an authorization at any time, except to the extent The Hartford, its business associates, or other entities have relied on such disclosure. 


Your Privacy Rights
This section of the Notice describes your rights as an individual with respect to your PHI and a brief description of how you may exercise these rights.


Right to Restrict Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment and Healthcare Operations Purposes.  You have the right to request that we restrict uses and disclosure of your PHI for activities related to treatment, payment and healthcare operations as described above.  Your request for the restriction must be in writing.  We will evaluate all requests for restrictions, however, we are generally not required to agree to the restriction.  In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to honor your request for a restriction on disclosures to another health plan relating to a health care item or service for which you paid in full.  If we agree to the restriction, we will abide by it, except in the case of emergency treatment or when required by law.  We will terminate our agreement to a restriction if you agree to or request the termination of the restriction.  If we decide to terminate our agreement to the restriction, we will notify you of our decision.


If you have paid for a health care item or service out-of-pocket and in full, you may request that we do not disclose to a health plan any PHI related solely to the item or service.  We are obligated to honor that request unless we are required by law to make a disclosure.  


Right to Request Confidential Communications.  You may request that we communicate with you by alternative means or at alternative locations.  For example, you may wish to receive communications from us at your work location rather than your home.  We will evaluate all such requests, however, we must only accommodate your request if you clearly state that the communication of all or part of your PHI could endanger you. 


Right to Inspect and Copy Your PHI.  You have a right to access, inspect, and copy your PHI contained in a “designated record set” for as long as The Hartford maintains the PHI in the designated record set.  Your right to access your PHI contained in a designated record set extends to any such information that is maintained in an electronic health record or another electronic form.  However, you do not have an automatic right to access psychotherapy notes or information compiled in reasonable anticipation of, or for use in, a criminal, civil or administrative action or proceeding.  We will act on a request for access within 30 days of receiving your request if the information is maintained and accessible on site or within 60 days otherwise (with a possible 30-day extension).  We will provide you with a summary of the PHI requested if you agree in advance to the summary and to the fees imposed. 


We may deny your request to access your PHI under certain circumstances.  If your request is denied, we will send you a notice that explains our reason for the denial, your review rights (if any), and how to file a complaint with our Privacy Officer or the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.  In certain instances we will provide you with an opportunity for a review of the denial.  The review decision must be made in a reasonable period of time, and we will send you a written notice of the review decision.  We may charge a reasonable fee for access, inspection and/or copying of your PHI.  This fee is based on the costs associated with copying, mailing, and summary preparation costs. 


Right to Amend Your PHI.  You have the right to request that we amend your PHI if you believe the information is incorrect or inaccurate.  We may deny your request to amend your PHI if we did not create the PHI, if the information is not part of our records, if the information was not available for inspection, or if the information is accurate and complete.  We will respond to your written request to amend your PHI within 60 days of the request (with a possible 30-day extension).


If your request for amendment is granted, we will notify you that the amendment was approved.  Upon your identification of relevant persons, we will obtain your agreement to inform them of the change.  We will make reasonable efforts to inform and provide the amendment within a reasonable time to persons identified by you and by us, including our business associates.


If your request for the amendment is denied, we will send you a written notice that explains the reason for the denial, your right to submit a written statement of disagreement or to have the request for amendment included with future disclosures, and your right to file a complaint with our Privacy Officer and/or the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.


We may prepare a rebuttal statement to your statement of disagreement.  We will provide you with a copy of the rebuttal statement.


Any future disclosures of your PHI will include the statement of disagreement or request for amendment, the denial notice, and the rebuttal or summary of this information.


Right to an Accounting of Disclosures.  You have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of your PHI made by The Hartford during the six years prior to the date of your request.  We will act on your request for an accounting of disclosures within 60 days (with a possible 30-day extension). 


This accounting of disclosures will not include disclosures made:prior to effective date of HIPAA, April 14, 2003;for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations;to you or your personal representative;pursuant to an authorization;for national security or intelligence purposes, as provided in regulations under HIPAA;to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials, as provided in regulations under HIPAA;incident to a use or disclosure permitted or required by law; andto persons involved in your care (if you were present), you were incapacitated, or for disaster relief purposes.  


We will provide you with one free accounting each year.  For subsequent requests, we will charge a reasonable fee.  The written accounting of disclosures will include the following information for each disclosure:  the date of the disclosure, the person to whom the information was disclosed, a brief description of the information disclosed or in lieu of the summary, a copy of the written request for the disclosure. 


Right to be Notified Following a Breach.  You have a right to notified if there has been a breach involving your unsecured PHI.


Right to a Copy of Notice of Privacy Practices.  You have the right to receive a paper copy of this Notice upon request, even if you agreed to receive the Notice electronically.


Complaints.  You may file a complaint with The Hartford or the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services if you believe your privacy rights have been violated.

Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Best life insurance plans and rates | LifePlans.com

































Compare the Top Online Life InsuranceCarriers in California 














Coverage as Low as $15 a Month!











Rates in less than 2 Minutes. 100% Free,Safe, and Secure!








Life Insurance Helps the Ones You Love with:

Mortgage Payments
College Tuition
Outstanding Debt
Monthly Income




The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
