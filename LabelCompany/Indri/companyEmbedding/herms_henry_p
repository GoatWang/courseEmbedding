Slim d'Hermès
A sketch as an exercise in style, the Slim d’Hermès embodies a shift toward minimalism with new symmetry between its delicate case and precision diameter. Clean lines are conveyed by uniquely written numbers designed by typographer Philippe Apeloig in 2015. Unadorned time that the Manufacture Hermès H1950 movement can portray.

DESIGN HISTORY
"Elaine Lustig Cohen (1927 - 2016) was an artist, graphic designer, and founder of Ex Libris, a bookstore specialising in the 20th century avant-garde. In 1955, she began her design career in New York by extending the idiom of European modernism into an American context for a diverse clientele of publishers, cultural institutions, corporations, and architects. As a painter, Lustig Cohen developed a hard-edged style in the 1960s and 1970s that asserted the canvas’ flat surface. She continued to experiment with bold colors and abstract shapes in a variety of media including collage and three-dimensional objects.
Philip Johnson - architect of the celebrated Glass House (1949) in New Canaan, Connecticut - became Lustig Cohen’s first client when he commissioned her to design to the lettering and signage for the Seagram Building. The two forged an important bond that resulted in a variety of projects for the Glass House, Yale University, and Lincoln Center, among others. Inspired by Lustig Cohen’s 2015 exhibition of painting and graphic design at the Glass House, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, artistic director of Hermès, met the artist and conceived of a scarf based on her painting Centered Rhyme (1967). This project was made in collaboration with The Glass House (and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the scarf will go towards the preservation of this iconic modernist house, a site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.)"

Quality roof protection doesn’t start with the roofing surface - it starts underneath. In cold climates, Henry residential roofing products can guard against damage from ice dams, or provide a vapor-proof barrier. In hurricane or tornado-prone areas, Henry roofing products can prevent interior damage from wind-driven rain, or help roofing tiles stay firmly adhered to the roof deck. In hot climates, Henry products can combat the damaging effects of the sun and excessive heat.Trust Henry for all your roofing needs.  Backed by more than 80 years of continuous building product improvements.

Slim d'Hermès
A sketch as an exercise in style, the Slim d’Hermès embodies a shift toward minimalism with new symmetry between its delicate case and precision diameter. Clean lines are conveyed by uniquely written numbers designed by typographer Philippe Apeloig in 2015. Unadorned time that the Manufacture Hermès H1950 movement can portray.

DESIGN HISTORY
"Elaine Lustig Cohen (1927 - 2016) was an artist, graphic designer, and founder of Ex Libris, a bookstore specialising in the 20th century avant-garde. In 1955, she began her design career in New York by extending the idiom of European modernism into an American context for a diverse clientele of publishers, cultural institutions, corporations, and architects. As a painter, Lustig Cohen developed a hard-edged style in the 1960s and 1970s that asserted the canvas’ flat surface. She continued to experiment with bold colors and abstract shapes in a variety of media including collage and three-dimensional objects.
Philip Johnson - architect of the celebrated Glass House (1949) in New Canaan, Connecticut - became Lustig Cohen’s first client when he commissioned her to design to the lettering and signage for the Seagram Building. The two forged an important bond that resulted in a variety of projects for the Glass House, Yale University, and Lincoln Center, among others. Inspired by Lustig Cohen’s 2015 exhibition of painting and graphic design at the Glass House, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, artistic director of Hermès, met the artist and conceived of a scarf based on her painting Centered Rhyme (1967). This project was made in collaboration with The Glass House (and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the scarf will go towards the preservation of this iconic modernist house, a site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.)"
