Sentence structure above makes it unclear -- do the Permanent Residents have to be over 18 but the US Citizens do not?  I'm hoping to open a checking account for my teenagers.

Pay What Is Fair
Our Fee is Your Choice

At Aspiration, you decide what to pay us. No, we’re not joking. And we’re not crazy (we hope).
We don't make a cent from you other than what you choose to pay. And then we hold down, negotiate down, and subsidize any expenses or fees to third-parties.
We’re betting that if we bring you good value, and act on good values, you’ll pay us fairly – and respect us for respecting you. Besides, if we ask you to trust us with your money, shouldn’t we trust you too?
And shouldn't the question really be: why doesn’t everyone else?




We put our money where our heart is.
We donate a dime out of every dollar our company earns to successful charities focused on bringing economic opportunity to struggling Americans.

Aspiration - Do Well. Do Good.



























































About Us | Aspiration




























































About Aspiration


Americans deserve a financial firm that has their back and shares their values. That’s why we created Aspiration.
Aspiration was born to be the financial firm for all. Because everyone deserves access to the best banking and investing products. Everyone deserves a financial partner they are confident they can trust.  And everyone deserves to put their money in an institution that puts “good” ahead of “greed.”



Profits are important. But what sets Aspiration apart is the belief that people are too. Our “Pay What Is Fair” fees mean we go to work every day committed to do great for our customers. And as a financial firm with a conscience, we are motivated by the mission to help you make money and make a difference at the same time.
When people come together around shared values and a sense of purpose, it's not a company — it's a community. That's what Aspiration is all about.

Dimes Worth of Difference | Aspiration




























































Dimes Worth of Difference

“At the heart of Aspiration is a mission: helping our customers make money and make a difference at the same time.”

Pay It Forward
Too many on Wall Street still believe that “greed is good,” but Aspiration has a different approach. We believe you can both do well for yourself and do good for the world.
At Aspiration, we’re in the “opportunity” business – striving to help our customers get ahead while also making it possible for other Americans to climb the ladder to a better life.
Through our “Dimes Worth of Difference” commitment, we donate ten cents of every dollar of our company’s revenue to charitable activities expanding economic opportunity. Working with respected partners such as the Accion U.S. Network, America’s largest provider of micro-loans, we help struggling Americans transform their own lives – not a hand out, but a hand up.
Then it’s your turn. We ask you to join us in this commitment by making a donation to the charitable cause of your choice through your Aspiration account. We’ve made it easy for you. Whether you give or not – or how much you give – is up to you.

Is Competition Really For Losers?












Defying its critics and building on the success of players like Wealthfront and Betterment, Aspiration, the new money management firm launched by Andrei Cherny, is off to a roaring start.
The company has 700 customers paying for its initial wealth management product, a portfolio of mutual funds operated by Emerald Asset Managment, a Pennsylvania-based asset management firm. In all, the company has received $2 million to manage for its clients.
That total is a fraction of Wealthfront’s $2 billion in assets, but not too shabby for a firm that’s a little less than two months into its money management.
“We basically disintermediate the financial industry and provide financial advisory products direct to the customer,” says Cherny.
Aspiration differentiates itself from other asset managers through its pay-what-you-will approach to fees, which Cherny sees as a way to bring in investors who mistrust the larger financial institutions thanks to their role in last decade’s financial crisis.
In addition to its laissez-faire approach to fees, Aspiration also includes a charitable component as part of its mission. The company gives away 10% of its revenue to charitable causes like micro-lending.
While fees are determined by the investor, there are other costs that are associated with fund management that Aspiration has to pass through to its customers. Roughly 1.72% of the company’s flagship fund assets are taken out as fees that are paid to the mutual funds that the firm has selected as part of its portfolio.
Cherny likes where Aspiration is headed. “We amassed more than 50,000 people on our waiting list and started sending out invites two months ago. We have more paying customers in our first two months, than either Wealthfront, Learnvest, or FutureAdvisor in their first year,” he says.
And the pay-what-you-wish model seems to be working, according to Cherny. “We’re actually finding that the majority of our customers are paying us the amount that is the suggested amount — or even more,” he says.
A typical Aspiration customer is under 35, making around $100,000 in annual salary, and for many of them, Aspiration is their first mutual fund. “Roughly 56% of our clients do not own a mutual fund other than the one they just purchased with Aspiration,” says Cherny.
Another 40% of them don’t even own a stock. Over 50% don’t own a mutual fund,” Cherny says. He cautions that it’s not necessarily the best idea for people and says that his company will be rolling out new products for investors to increase the diversification of their investments.
“We are bringing direct-consumer products from the best fund managers in the world to the customers who need those products,” says Cherny.

Aspiration - Financial Product Reviews












































































Financial Product ReviewsFinancial Product Reviews - SaverocityAspiration
July 9, 2015 by Matt 1 Comment It’s been a while since I did a product review, but Aspiration leaped out at me this week.  We started to discuss them in the Forum to see if they might be a good investment option.  And then today they ran a new Ad campaign trying to benefit from the current little spat between Betterment and Wealthfront (which is over a $3 monthly fee.. oh the humanity!)So enter Aspiration.  They make bold claims, positioning themselves as the firm you can trust, the firm that isn’t like Wall St and is designed for the average middle class American.  They cite transparency and openness, and they offer something interesting: You pick what you pay in fees.Sounds amazing right? 
Conscience, trust, middle class….
Focused on keywords like Trust, and aiming at the little guy.
Differentiation (note the fee section)
Fees seem so much more trustworthySo what are you thinking so far?  Pretty cool company, and you pay what you want in fees, what the heck!  Let’s do this… but before we dive in, perhaps there are other fees to consider?  For example, the Robo giants of Betterment and Wealthfront both charge a management fee (around 0.25%) on top of the underlying ETFs that make up the portfolio.  Maybe there’s some underlying fees to look at with these guys too, and your choice is to pick the management fee aspect?
No catchI have to say I love the transparency here, the confidence in which they say this makes me feel that ‘trust’ they talk about.  Great stuff.

What are Aspiration’s fees? What is “Pay What Is Fair?”Most investment firms impose a flat management fee on their customers. That means you pay a set amount no matter how well the investment does, how hard the adviser is working, or how much you like what the company stands for. We think that’s not right and not respectful to customers.Instead, at Aspiration, you decide how much to pay us. We’re confident enough in our products and confident enough in the honor of our customers to trust you to do the right thing. We call this “Pay What Is Fair” because this fee model is fair to you and because we’re counting on you to be fair to us. We will not earn a cent from you other than the fee you select.
No Fees!Looking good! Click around a bit more, and we are sent to an external website that discusses their funds a little more deeply.
But wait.. here’s a fee!
Fees AppearLet’s pause a moment to see if you kept up with all that no fee, no fee, no fee, FEE! Shazam, and ask a quick question:If you invest with Aspiration, how much will you pay in fees?The savvy among you might think that it would be 0.5% + a ‘tip’ perhaps something between 0%-2% for their management fee. Compared to Betterment charging perhaps 0.15-0.2% for their underlying ETFs and a 0.25% management fee.  Kinda close, maybe lean towards the Robots?That’s actually what I thought on first glance too, but when you look at the prospectus for the above fund something odd happens.  You have to go off this website and to the SEC to find it (the folk at Aspiration sent me the link for some reason) and you get the following:Aspiration Flagship Fund SEC Filing
SEC filing for fund
The fees…The left column shows how much you would pay in fees if you paid no fees. 1.35%.  The right column is for illustration and shows what you would pay in fees if you elected to pay the top end of the ‘tip’ at 2%, you’d be looking at 3.35%.  It’s worth noting that this entire fee doesn’t go to the firm, but the point is that fees are deducted from your earnings, and it appears they could be up to 11x more than the Robo firms that they are bashing on Twitter.Interesting stuff.

Aspiration Closes $15.5 Million In Series A Funding Led By Renren

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspiration, the next-generation financial services platform that combines making money and making a difference, announced today that it has closed $15.5 million in Series A funding. Renren led the round with participation from GSV Capital, Capricorn Investment Group, IGSB, and some of America's most prominent leaders in finance and technology, including David Bonderman, Gordon Crawford, Matthew Dowd, Rick Hess, Bill Lee, Joe Lonsdale, Alexis Maybank, Lenny Mendonca, Steven Rattner, Dan Rosensweig, Matthew Salzberg, Joseph Sanberg, and Frank Yeary. 
"Aspiration is a financial firm for everyone that is built on the idea that profits and purpose can go hand-in-hand," said Andrei Cherny, CEO and co-founder of Aspiration. "We are thrilled that this approach has not only resonated with so many customers, but now has received the backing of a group of brilliant and innovative leaders who share our mission. With this additional capital and support, we can expand the products and services we offer to the growing ranks of the Aspiration community." 
Joseph Chen, Chairman and CEO of Renren, commented, "Renren is committed to investing in the most important and fastest-growing fintech platforms, so we could not be more thrilled about the opportunity to invest in Aspiration. The financial industry is ripe for transformation and, with its 'do well and do good' approach, we believe Aspiration is poised to be one of the defining new financial brands for 21st century consumers – first in the United States and then around the world." 
Aspiration creates and curates financial products and brings them directly to the customer at Aspiration.com, thereby disintermediating traditional advisors and middle-men. Aspiration's mutual funds have a $500 minimum investment. It recently unveiled a high-yield, FDIC-insured checking account: The Aspiration Summit Account offers up to 100 times the interest rates provided on checking accounts at the big banks, no minimum balance requirement or monthly service fees, and free access to every ATM in the world. 
Aspiration's unmatched pro-investor approach trusts its customers to pay only what they think the company deserves, even if that means zero. Aspiration brings a unique charitable aspect to financial services by donating 10% of its revenue to charities providing microloans and mentoring for low-income Americans to start businesses – and helping its customers give to the causes of their choice as well. 
Launched in November 2014, Aspiration has become one of the fastest growing online financial firms in America – eclipsing the growth rates of the so-called "robo-advisors":

Over the past six months, Aspiration has been doubling its number of accounts an average of every six weeks. 
60% of Aspiration's customers have not previously owned another retail investment product. 
Aspiration customers are in all 50 states and U.S. Armed Forces serving overseas, with over 70% outside of New York and California. 
While most Aspiration customers are Millennials, they range in age from 18 to 88. 
Over 90% of the investors in the Aspiration Flagship Fund choose to pay Aspiration even though they are not obligated to – a testament to the honorable nature of most Americans and the value Aspiration customers see in its products.
"Wall Street works great for a fortunate few, but most Americans have been left out of the possibility of wealth-creation because they haven't had a financial firm they felt they could trust or one laser-focused on their specific needs and goals," said Joseph N. Sanberg, co-founder and chair of Aspiration's Board of Advisors. "With its unique model, groundbreaking technology and customer-friendly education approach, Aspiration is successfully opening the doors of investing to the middle class."

Using cutting-edge technology, Aspiration is revolutionizing how financial services are delivered to Americans by successfully pioneering a democratized and purpose-driven investment firm with a conscience and building an unprecedented level of trust with its customers.

Aspiration Launches Redwood Investment Fund to Bring Sustainable Investing To Everyday Investors

In Strategic Partnership with UBS Asset Management, the Aspiration Redwood Fund Will Seek to Invest in Companies Whose Sustainable Environmental, Social and Governance Practice Yield Strong Financial Returns




Nov 18, 2015, 7:00am EST














LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Aspiration, an online financial firm with a conscience, today announced the launch of the Aspiration Redwood Fund, a unique financial product paralleling the approach taken by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board.  Many Americans, especially Millennials, make purchasing decisions in part by considering the causes and mission of the companies that produce and sell the products they buy. The Aspiration Redwood Fund brings this "conscious consumer" approach to investing in a manner designed to combine social and financial goals. Available exclusively on Aspiration.com, the Aspiration Redwood Fund is managed day-to-day by UBS Asset Management (Americas) Inc., based on a strategy available to UBS' institutional and private wealth clients. 
"People are driving hybrids, drinking fair trade coffee, and buying organic milk. But we think everyday investors have found that when it comes to investing their options are to hold their nose, accept lower returns, or just walk away," said Andrei Cherny, CEO of Aspiration.  "The Aspiration Redwood Fund seeks to give everyone the chance to invest with their values in mind, and build value at the same time. We see sustainable and impact investing solutions as experiencing unprecedented demand, and our aim with the Aspiration Redwood Fund is to help move sustainable investing from a niche for the few to a core allocation in the everyday investor's portfolio." 
Just a year old, Aspiration – an online financial firm with a conscience – has become one of the fastest growing investment businesses in America. Over the past nine months, Aspiration has been doubling its number of accounts an average of every six weeks.
In the past, socially responsible investing meant stripping out negative factors such as oil and tobacco production, which sometimes resulted in lower returns.  However, recent studies have shown that sustainable companies that make materially impactful decisions to strengthen their environmental, workplace, and governance practices are more valuable than their similar peers. While the volume of sustainable investments nearly doubled from 2012 to 2014, almost all that investment came from America's wealthiest individuals and institutions. In strategic partnership with UBS Asset Management, the Aspiration Redwood Fund offers everyday consumers seeking out companies with good reputations access to sustainable strategies that previously may have been out of reach. 
Its "Pay What Is Fair" business model trusts customers to choose the fee they pay Aspiration even if it is zero. It is also one of the most charitable financial firms in America, donating 10% of revenue to microloans and mentoring for low-income Americans. Recently, its high-interest checking account was awarded this year's "Best Checking Account" by Money magazine. 
Thomas Digenan, head of the U.S. Intrinsic Value Equity team and Bruno Bertocci, head of the Sustainable Equities team at UBS Asset Management, will be acting as portfolio managers for the Aspiration Redwood Fund.  UBS will be joining Aspiration in being compensated on a "Pay What Is Fair" basis and donating 10% of their revenue in this Fund. 
"We're thrilled to work with Aspiration to bring sustainable investing to the everyday investor," said Bertocci.  "We have seen from our clients that investors are more conscious than ever about where they are putting their money, and the Aspiration Redwood Fund is the perfect stepping stone for the middle class to build value with peace of mind."
The Aspiration Redwood Fund only requires a minimum investment of $500. The Fund will trade under the ticker REDWX.  For more information about the Aspiration Redwood Fund, please visit http://www.funds.aspiration.com/redwood.

This New Investment Firm Lets You Pay Whatever You Want For Its Service

CEO
  and founder Andrei Cherny isn't worried clients won't
  pay.

Aspiration




Aspiration, an online
  investment firm that launched Tuesday, has a radical idea.


  Unlike traditional investment firms, which charge a percentage of
  the assets invested, the company plans to go in another
  direction: Pay whatever you think is fair.


  "Our fee structure is very revolutionary," explains CEO and
  founder Andrei Cherny. "It empowers customers to make that
  decision and gives them the ability to decide whether or not
  we're doing a good job for them, and whether or not our values
  are aligned."


  He points out that in most investment firms, the people managing
  your money get paid the same amount whether or not they do a good
  job, and that hinging the company's livelihood on pleasing
  customers provides an incentive to serve them well.


  Cherny, who has a long history in financial regulation, ranging
  from a position as a financial fraud prosecutor to working with
  Senator Elizabeth Warren fighting for the establishment of the
  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, built his investment firm
  for middle-class investors, who he says are under-served in the
  current market.


  "We're bringing forth a wide range of investment products and
  investments geared toward the needs of the middle-class
  investor," he explains. "Look at the customer base of hedge funds
  and private equity shops. They serve a clientele that's mostly
  multimillionaires and large institutions. Everyone else is buying
  stocks and mutual funds, doing it on their own."


  Aspiration is so committed to serving the middle-class investor
  that it has imposed not only the usual minimum investment
  requirements on its clients (in this case, an unusually low
  $500), but also a maximum investment: $100,000 per customer, per
  fund.


  Cherny says the cap is to keep the company focused on the
  under-served investor. "If you have a fund where some people pay
  $500 and a handful put in $10 million, you're almost naturally
  focused more on that type of customer." With the investment cap,
  Aspiration aims to limit that sort of bias.





On
  the Aspiration site, you can manage your investments and
  charitable contributions.

Aspiration





  Aspiration — whose motto is "Do Well. Do Good." — is also
  focused on giving back to the community. Through its "Dimes Worth
  Of Difference" campaign, it donates 10 cents of every dollar of
  revenue to provide micro-loans to struggling Americans.


  Additionally, users are encouraged to give the amount of their
  choosing to the charity of their choice on the website's
  dashboard. "It's the TOMS and Warby Parker approach to charitable
  giving," explains Cherny, "but instead of shoe for shoe, it's
  economic opportunity for economic opportunity."





The homepage of Aspiration
  is different than the sites of more traditional investment
  firms.

Aspiration





  Cherny isn't worried that his clients will refuse to pay.
  "A lot of behavioral psychology over the past 10 or so years
  shows that people have a strong sense of moral obligation and
  reciprocity," he explains. "That's as powerful or more powerful
  than locking people into a legal contract. If we're not
  delivering the products we said we would or living up to the
  values we set up for ourselves, they have the ability to not pay
  us."


  Aspiration is not the only company to use a pay-what-you-want
  strategy, but it's the first financial company we've come across.
  Some retailers have had success with the model — 
  a North Carolina diner initially tripled its revenues when it
  asked customers to pay what God wants — but there's little
  evidence it's sustainable or that users trying to make the most
  of their money would choose to fork over fees.


  However, Cherny isn't alone in his confidence. The company, which
  has spent a little over a year getting ready for launch, has
  raised over $4.5 million in funding and counts eBay founding
  president Jeff Skoll as a member of its board of advisors.
  Aspiration's "radical approach to its customers' fees relies on a
  trust-based model, consistent in spirit with an approach that I
  saw drive eBay's early success," Skoll said in a press release.
  "It's a bold bet and one that I believe will shake up a financial
  industry that could use some positive disruption."


  Aspiration is now in an invite-only period, and will allow
  potential clients to "jump the line" by sharing information about
  the company on social media.

		The chart above represents the growth of a hypothetical investment of $10,000. The total 
		return is not adjusted to reflect sales charges or taxes, however it does show actual 
		ongoing fund expenses and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. If 
		the returns were adjusted to include sales charges, the quoted performance would be 
		lower.

			Total return reflects performance without adjusting for sales charges or the effects 
			of taxation, but is adjusted to reflect all actual ongoing fund expenses and assumes 
			reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. If adjusted, sales charges would reduce 
			the performance quoted.
		

The performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Investment Returns, Risks and ComplexitiesCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. A prospectus, obtained by calling 800-669-3900 or by clicking on the prospectus link, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.A mutual fund is not FDIC-insured, may lose value, and is not guaranteed by a bank or other financial institution. Performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results, and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from mutual fund companies, including those participating in its no-load, no-transaction-fee program, for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative and distribution services. The amount of TD Ameritrade's remuneration for these services is based in part on the amount of investments in such funds by TD Ameritrade clients. PLEASE ALSO SEE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL FUND FEE DISCLOSURE INFORMATIONNo-transaction-fee funds and other funds offered through TD Ameritrade have other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the fund and are described in the prospectus.Mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are subject to market, exchange rate, political, credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks, which vary depending on the type of fund.  International investments involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and political and economic instability. Asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Fund purchases may be subject to investment minimums, eligibility and other restrictions, as well as charges and expenses.Although certain money market funds seek to preserve their value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.  Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain circumstances.Some mutual funds sold through TD Ameritrade impose a charge on the purchase of shares, called a “sales load.” An investor may be able to purchase fund shares through TD Ameritrade without paying a front-end sales load, but an investor  may be charged a fee, called a “contingent deferred sales charge,” when the investor sells or redeems shares.  TD Ameritrade may receive part or all of the sales load.Some mutual funds offer reductions in front-end sales loads (“breakpoints”) for purchases over certain amounts or purchases through Letters of Intent or Rights of Accumulation.  Some funds also offer waivers of those loads, often to retirement plans or charities.  Such breakpoints or waivers will be as further described in the prospectus. You, as the investor, should determine and obtain any breakpoints or waivers or provide TD Ameritrade with sufficient information to assist it in obtaining them.Most mutual funds charge 2.00% on the redemption of shares (including by exchange) held for less than a certain number of calendar days.  Performance figures reported do not reflect the deduction of this fee. If reflected, the fee would reduce the performance quoted. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for redemption fee information. TD Ameritrade may also charge its own short-term redemption fee.See the SEC Guide to Mutual Funds for more information.TD AMERITRADE RISKS OF INVESTING IN FUNDS: PLEASE READ IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUND, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND, AND CLOSED-END FUND RISK DISCLOSURESResearch and planning tools are obtained by unaffiliated third-party sources deemed reliable by TD Ameritrade. However, TD Ameritrade does not guarantee their accuracy and completeness and makes no warranties with respect to results to be obtained from their use. The Investment Profile report is for informational purposes only.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Investment Management LLC is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.
