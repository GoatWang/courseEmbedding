A state dinner at the White House, the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, once-in-a-lifetime birthday celebrations—every lucky guest knows that there is no party like a David Monn party. Using scent, sound, sight, touch, and taste, Monn designs events to be “shared, lived, and felt” by everyone there. Monn’s three favorite words—authenticity, scale, and detail—inform every chapter of his book, following him from classic New York nights to events around the world and back again to the most private rites of passage, including entertaining at home. How to do this yourself? It means considering your home as not just rooms, but instead as “a living environment,” and not thinking of a birthday as a party, but rather “a milestone of accomplishment and growth.” Here, Monn draws from his personal archive of 20,000 event photographs to reveal the unique beauty of each event. 




Praise

"There's no party like a David Monn party--but now your event can emulate the master's, thanks to this luxe volume of entertaining inspiration. . . . Let the celebration begin!"
— Traditional Home


"After more than a dozen years in the business, the elite party planner and former interior designer is releasing a new book. The tome offers decor and etiquette tips along with more than 200 photographs. . . . Now all that festive creativity can enliven your next soiree. . . or at least your coffee table." 
— New York Post
