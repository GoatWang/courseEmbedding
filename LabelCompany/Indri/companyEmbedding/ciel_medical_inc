Our Products
The Sherpa Suction System

VAP Prevention
VAP is an expensive and deadly hospital-acquired infection (HAI) leading to increased intensive care and hospital length of stay, increased mortality risk and increased direct medical costs1. Aspiration is widely recognized as the primary etiology of VAP but current subglottic suction ETTs are expensive and require broad, non-selective upfront use2.
1Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2014;35(8):915-936
2Chest 2001;119;228-235

Our Solution
 The Sherpa Suction System enables above-the-cuff placement of a suction catheter allowing for removal of pooled secretions3. It is designed to help reduce aspiration and the subsequent risk of VAP cost effectively. Compared to subglottic suction ETTs  our suction system may be able to reduce costs by  allowing for selective use in only the patients that need it.

Watch a quick video about the Sherpa Suction System.







 The NEMO Gauge

Tube Location
Location of the endotracheal tube in a ventilated patient's airway is critical to ensure appropriate ventilation. Current standard of care is to confirm tube location by a chest x-ray.  This can cause  ICU workflow inefficiencies, additional patient radiation exposure and add to ICU cost.
Our Solution
Our solution is the NEMO Gauge - a simple, disposable catheter that can be used to measure endotracheal tube position quickly. NEMO can be used in combination with confirming x-rays which may take longer.  NEMO can reduce the time to check the tube position4.

Ciel Medical Devices –
























Ciel Medical, Inc Ciel Medical is solving unmet clinical needs in the ICU.


Our Products
The Sherpa Suction System

VAP Prevention
VAP is an expensive and deadly hospital-acquired infection (HAI) leading to increased intensive care and hospital length of stay, increased mortality risk and increased direct medical costs1. Aspiration is widely recognized as the primary etiology of VAP but current subglottic suction ETTs are expensive and require broad, non-selective upfront use2.
1Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2014;35(8):915-936
2Chest 2001;119;228-235

Our Solution
 The Sherpa Suction System enables above-the-cuff placement of a suction catheter allowing for removal of pooled secretions3. It is designed to help reduce aspiration and the subsequent risk of VAP cost effectively. Compared to subglottic suction ETTs  our suction system may be able to reduce costs by  allowing for selective use in only the patients that need it.
3Crit Care Med 2016; Vol 44; Number 12; Abstract 1003

Watch a quick video about the Sherpa Suction System.







 The NEMO Gauge

Tube Location
Location of the endotracheal tube in a ventilated patient's airway is critical to ensure appropriate ventilation. Current standard of care is to confirm tube location by a chest x-ray.  This can cause  ICU workflow inefficiencies, additional patient radiation exposure and add to ICU cost.
Our Solution
Our solution is the NEMO Gauge - a simple, disposable catheter that can be used to measure endotracheal tube position quickly. NEMO can be used in combination with confirming x-rays which may take longer.  NEMO can reduce the time to check the tube position4.
4Data on file at Ciel Medical  

Watch a quick video about the NEMO Gauge.
