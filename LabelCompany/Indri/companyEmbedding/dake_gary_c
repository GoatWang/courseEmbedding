Hometown flavor keeps Stewart’s Shops strong


                  When William Dake ran Stewart’s Shops, he had a unique method for scouting new store locations.
              






Gary C. Dake, President of Stewarts Shops Corp., left, has a lighter moment with customers and works with Mark Hotaling, Manager of the Stewart's on Freeman's Bridge Rd. recently.




 
 Outlook 2014Get the latest business news from Outlook 2014  When William Dake ran Stewart’s Shops, he had a unique method for scouting new store locations.   “He had his own single-engine plane, and he would literally get up and fly around over a community to see the traffic patterns,” his son Gary recalled on a recent winter day. “His favorite trick was to go on a morning when there had been a light snow the evening before; that way he could see where all the tire tracks were and how everybody got to work.”   It was as effective as getting traffic counts from the state Department of Transportation. And in the 1970s and ’80s — before online maps were available — it was the simplest way to see which neighborhoods and corridors could use a Stewart’s.   Today, there aren’t many spots left in the Capital Region to put a Stewart’s. Still, when the Dake family happens upon an untapped market so close to home, they get excited.   “It’s funny,” said Gary Dake, president of Stewart’s Shops. “We still find these little pockets in the Capital District where there’s a hole that could use a Stewart’s store. When Galway opened in the spring, the response was just unbelievable.”   The rural Saratoga County town got a Stewart’s Shop last year at the corner of routes 29 and 147. Business has been nonstop since it opened, Dake said.   Keeping busy   The Malta-headquartered convenience store chain had another busy year in 2013. In addition to building two new stores and replacing five outdated locations, Stewart’s acquired five 7-Eleven convenience stores in the North Country, installed a 600-kilowatt solar array on its dairy plant complex in Greenfield, won numerous awards for its dairy products, introduced its own line of K-cup coffee, and saw continued success with its new private-label beer and energy drinks.   The coming year should be another year of growth for the chain, which had 331 stores across eastern New York and southern Vermont as of mid-January. Stewart’s wants to build a new store in its home county on Sitterly Road in Clifton Park and is also hoping to build new stores in the Utica and Syracuse areas, where the chain has sporadic shops and no shops, respectively.   “It’s tough for us to grow into new markets,” said Dake. “We really learned that quite a bit when we went into Watertown. When we go into a new area, the hardest part is teaching people how to use a Stewart’s store because if you’re from someplace else, you don’t go to a convenience store for low-cost, high-quality dairy products. If you went to college with friends from out of the area and said, ‘I’m going to take you out for ice cream,’ and they see you pull into a convenience store they think you’re crazy.”   Of course, Stewart’s doesn’t fit the model of a typical convenience store. That’s because it began in 1921 as an ice cream company that had stores and over time became a store chain that had ice cream. “It sounds like a semantic difference, but it’s not,” said Dake.   In 2013, the chain, which boasts nearly 5,000 employees, also added a new shop in Latham at the intersection of Wade Road Extension and Forts Ferry Road. The chain also replaced five outdated stores last year in Glenville on Freemans Bridge Road, in Schenectady on Hamburg Street, in West Cohoes on Columbia Street, in Greenwich on Main Street and in Herkimer on Mohawk Street.   Stewart’s also acquired five 7-Eleven stores north of the Capital Region: in the Jefferson County city of Watertown, the St. Lawrence County town of Potsdam, the Adirondack village of Lake Placid, the rural St. Lawrence County village of Heuvelton and the Clinton County village of Keeseville.   “They couldn’t make the stores work in the North Country, and we have experience in the North Country,” said Dake.   Do it yourself   The strategy to Stewart’s success seems to be its smart use of vertical integration. The chain manufactures three-quarters of what it sells in its stores and has its own warehouses, too, so it needn’t pay others to make and store its merchandise.   This style of doing business began with Stewart’s milk, which today comes from more than 30 dairy farms in Saratoga, Washington and Rensselaer counties, with a cow-to-shelf time of just two days. Stewart’s uses the same milk to make its own ice cream and dairy products. Over the years, it grew to the point where Stewart’s was making many of the food and beverage items it sold in its stores.   In 2010, Stewart’s introduced its own line of beer called Mountain Brew for 75 cents a can, or $2.99 a six-pack. The company was able to do this, said Dake, because it has its own warehouse beer permit.   “We buy direct from a manufacturer in Wisconsin and don’t go through a distributor, so that cuts out a whole middle man, which cuts out the cost,” he said. “So it’s really cheap. I’m not proud to say it, but it is the cheapest beverage you can buy in a Stewart’s store. It’s not the best tasting beer on the market, but I don’t think it’s the worst, either. And I’ll tell you, it’s the best $2.99 six-pack beer you’re going to find because you’re not going to find another $2.99 six-pack of beer.”   In 2012, Stewart’s began selling its own energy drinks — one a lower-cost version of Red Bull and another a lower cost version of five-hour energy drinks. And just recently, the chain began selling its “S-cups” — single-serve cups of Stewart’s brand coffee that can be used in a Keurig machine.   In essence, vertical integration has allowed Stewart’s to perfect the model of selling the same quality products at a lower cost. Of course, there’s one product Stewart’s sells for a low cost that many believe is superior in quality to most brands: Stewarts’ award-winning ice cream is so well-known today that there is demand for it across the country.   Last summer, one man’s quest to fulfill his pregnant wife’s cravings for Stewart’s ice cream made headlines when people learned he was willing to fly to New York from South Carolina to get it. His wife lived down South, but had experienced the joy of Peanut Butter Pandemonium during her time working at an amusement park in the region.   Staying home   Dake said it is sometimes hard to resist the temptation to sell Stewart’s ice cream outside of the 150-mile radius the chain’s stores now occupy.   “We’ve talked about it, but there are a couple problems,” he said. “We don’t know who we trust to pay us. When you sell to someone on the outside, you’re always getting pressured to find a way to cut the price. We do it to our suppliers. And there are tremendous pressures to cut quality when you have pressure to cut the price.”   That’s one of the reasons Stewart’s ice cream (and milk) regularly wins first-place awards at statewide and national contests. In the ice cream business, it’s just too easy to cut costs, said Dake.   “The ice cream business is the worst,” he said. “It is always easy to find a way to cut just another penny, another penny, another penny. You find a little cheaper ingredient. You cut back the butterfat a little bit. Ice cream is almost half air, so you could put in a little bit more air. And I could give you two samples next to one another and you probably couldn’t tell the difference by that one penny I just took out. The problem is, you do that 10 times in a row and you’ll be able to taste the difference. We can avoid that temptation now.”   Stewart’s ended 2013 with $1.6 billion in sales, up from $1.5 billion the year before.   In the coming year, the company aims to enter the still-new market in Utica and the brand new market in Syracuse. It will also continue looking for places close to home that could use a Stewart’s, like the corner of Clifton Park Center and Sitterly roads in Clifton Park. Even though Stewart’s already has multiple locations in Clifton Park, that pocket of town is desirable for the chain, said Dake. The key is knowing when you’ve reached saturation in a market, he said.   “How many more stores do I need in Schenectady?” he said. “I’ve got 43 or 44 in Saratoga County. I mean, that’s a lot of stores. Sitterly will be one more, but Saratoga County is seeing a lot of growth. What we found was when you reach a certain mass, people don’t talk about going to the closest convenience store anymore — Hess or Cumberland Farms or Stewart’s — they talk about going to the closest Stewart’s.”   Reach Gazette reporter Bethany Bump at 395-3107 or bbump@dailygazette.net.
