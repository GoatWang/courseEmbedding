Description



        		Biochem/physiol Actions
				
				

        AUDA is a potent inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase
        

        Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase by AUDA inhibits the metabolism of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and protects end-organs against the damaging effects of salt-sensitive hypertension. AUDA also renders protection against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and cerebral ischemia.


        		Packaging
				
				

        10, 50 mg in glass bottle
        

        		Application
				
				

        AUDA may be used in soluble epoxide hydrolase-mediated cell signaling studies.

The Handbook of Receptor Classification and Signal Transduction







What is The Handbook of Receptor Classification and Signal Transduction?
The Handbook of Receptor Classification and Signal Transduction is a reference for scientists, researchers, educators, and the like. It contains over 100 entries covering such topics as Intracellular Signaling Enzymes and Receptors, signal transduction, Ion Channels, Non-Peptide Receptors, Synthesis and Metabolism, Peptide Receptors and Peptide Metabolism, Protein Kinase, Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine Kinases, and Transporters.
Each entry contains a peer-reviewed overview, key references and tables providing valuable information on structure, subtypes, selective agonists, selective antagonists, tissue distribution and much more. This on-line version links directly to hundreds of related products.
