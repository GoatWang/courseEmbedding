About Bragg Financial Advisors

Bragg Financial Advisors has been helping families and institutions reach their financial goals and objectives for over 50 years. Today Bragg Financial offers fee-based investment management and financial, tax and estate planning for wealthy families and provides consulting and investment selection, monitoring and due diligence for companies, endowments, and private foundations. The firm has grown and evolved over time, but has remained true to its core founding principles of providing clear, objective advice and a high level of personal service. We invite you to read more below about our firm history, our managing principals and the services that our clients enjoy.


John Bragg, Frank Bragg, Benton Bragg, Steve Scruggs, Phillips Bragg

Firm Founder Frank Bragg
Roots J. Frank Bragg Jr. grew up in the tobacco fields of Oxford in eastern North Carolina. He graduated from Wake Forest in 1961 and joined the group benefits department of Security Life & Trust in Winston-Salem, NC. He soon moved to Charlotte, NC and began building his financial planning and group benefits practice. With the creation of the 401(k) in 1981, Frank used his expert knowledge of the 403(b) markets to grow the firm significantly. By the late 1980s the firm served many 401(k) plans in the Charlotte area as well as individuals and families. 

Growth




My First Calculator

 The firm grew in the early/mid 1990s as Frank began to hire his sons, John, Benton, and Phillips, and son-in-law, Steve Scruggs. All four have an undergraduate or graduate degree from Wake Forest and worked for banks and other financial institutions before joining the firm. John Bragg joined the firm in 1990 after working with the Hinrichs Financial Group. Benton was a branch manager with Nationsbank and joined the firm in 1993. Phillips joined Bragg Financial in 1996 after serving as a Trust Officer with Wachovia Bank. Steve Scruggs joined the firm in 2000 after working in product development at the same company (now known as GMAC Insurance) in Winston- Salem where Frank started his career.
 
 
 


Fee Based Investment Advisor & Queens Road Mutual Funds


Ben Rose and Steve Scruggs
 The late 1990s saw a change in our firm's structure as we registered with the Securities & Exchange Commission as a Registered Investment Advisor and began offering fee-based investment advice and planning. Queens Road Securities, our broker-dealer firm, was started to allow us to offer our clients greater independence and freedom from conflicts that often hamstring other advisors tied to large financial institutions. The practice moved to 100 Queens Road in 1998 and continued to grow, offering investment management and tax and estate planning services to higher net worth families. In 2002, Bragg founded the Queens Road family of mutual funds. Managed by Steve Scruggs, the funds have garnered high ratings from Morningstar, recognition in the Wall Street Journal, Kiplinger's and other industry publications. In 2009, Morningstar named Steve Scruggs an "Undiscovered Manager," recognizing the performance of the Queens Road Funds.

The Present




Lessons From My Father

 Today, Bragg Financial manages over $1 billion for institutions, private clients and the Queens Road Funds. We offer fee-based investment management and financial, tax and estate planning to approximately 300 families in the Charlotte region. In addition, the firm provides consulting and investment selection, monitoring and due diligence for companies, endowments, and private foundations. In 2009, we moved to our new office building in Dilworth located beside the Dowd YMCA, one block off of Morehead Street. We invite you to read more about our firm in these pages and contact us if you would like to talk further to see if our firm would be a good fit for your needs.

What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
