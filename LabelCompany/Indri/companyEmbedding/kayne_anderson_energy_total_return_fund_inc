      partnerships and their affiliates, and other companies that derive at 
      least 50% of their revenues from operating assets used in, or providing

Objective

KYE is a closed-end fund that invests principally in equity and debt securities of companies in the energy industry, such as energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs), midstream corporations, marine transportation and energy-related debt. KYE’s objective is to obtain a high total return with an emphasis on current income.



Investment Merits

Diversified Portfolio of Energy Investments
KYE targets a diversified investment portfolio across multiple energy sub-sectors – MLPs, midstream corporations, marine transportation and energy-related debt. This multi-sector strategy allows KYE to reduce the portfolio’s volatility.
Positive Long-Term Outlook for Energy Industry
Global demand for energy continues to increase, largely driven by global population increases and continued growth from developing economies. KYE believes that demand growth will increase the need for additional energy infrastructure assets and create growth opportunities for KYE's portfolio investments.
Attractive Fund Structure
- KYE issues a Form 1099 (as opposed to K-1s issued by MLPs).- Suitable for IRAs, foundations and tax-exempt accounts, because unlike direct holdings in MLPs, KYE does not generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).

Quarterly Distributions per Share
   View the complete Distribution History for KYE.

Information on Tax Character of Distributions
Our distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income (a portion of which may be qualified dividends) or capital gains. Distributions of our ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. If our distributions exceed our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a return of capital to our common stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s basis in our common stock, and then the amount distributed in excess of such stockholder’s basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Common stockholders will receive a Form 1099 from us and will recognize ordinary income only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the cash distributions received from the MLPs in our portfolio are expected to exceed the earnings and profits associated with owning such MLPs, a portion of our distributions may be paid from sources other than our current and accumulated earnings and profits. The table below summarizes the tax character of our distributions since inception. Sample Form 1099-DIV for each year can be found at www.kaynefunds.com/kye/tax-information.

This table illustrates the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund's common shares beginning on the inception date with all distributions reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). Ending values as of the dates shown in the table. Performance does not reflect transaction fees or broker commissions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.






1) Payable on 7/14/17 (ex-date 7/6/17) for the quarter ended 5/31/17. (See "Information on Tax Character of Distributions" on Distributions tab)2) Assumes that distributions have been reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP)
3) As of May 31, 2017, this estimate is based on our estimated earnings and profits for fiscal 2017, which does not include a projection for gains or losses on the sale of securities during the remainder of fiscal 2017. The final determination of the tax character of our distributions will be made after our fiscal year-end when we can determine our actual earnings and profits for the full year. The final tax status of our distributions is dependent on our earnings and profits (including gains and losses on the sale of securities) for the remainder of our fiscal year and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.This material shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale is not permitted. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An investment in the fund could suffer loss. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown based on market fluctuations from the end of the reported period. Before making an investment in the fund, you should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the fund, which, together with and other important information are included in the fund's most recent prospectus and other filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objectives will be attained. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares, and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

Kayne Anderson Energy Total Return Fund Announces Distribution Of $0.25 Per Share For Q2 2017






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 6:20 PM EDT













 




























































  Kayne Anderson Energy Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") (NYSE:KYE) announced today its quarterly distribution of $0.25 per share for the quarter ended May 31, 2017.  The distribution will be payable on July 14, 2017 to common stockholders of record on July 10, 2017, with an ex-dividend date of July 6, 2017. The Fund estimates that 70% of this distribution will be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. This estimate is based on the Fund's anticipated earnings and profits for fiscal 2017 (including gains and losses on sales of securities during the six months ended May 31, 2017) and its accumulated earnings and profits as of May 31, 2017. The Fund's estimate does not include a projection of gains or losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2017. The final determination of the tax character of the distribution will be made in early 2018 when the Fund can determine its actual earnings and profits for the full year (including gains and losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2017) and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.  The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 whose common stock is traded on the NYSE. The Fund's investment objective is to obtain a high total return with an emphasis on current income by investing primarily in securities of companies engaged in the energy industry, principally including publicly-traded energy-related master limited partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships and their affiliates, energy-related U.S. and Canadian trusts and income trusts and other companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from operating assets used in, or providing energy-related services for, the exploration, development, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storing, refining, distribution, mining or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from the Fund's historical experience and its present expectations or projections indicated in any forward-looking statement. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and political conditions; regulatory and legal changes; energy industry risk; commodity pricing risk; leverage risk; valuation risk; non-diversification risk; interest rate risk; tax risk; and other risks discussed in the Fund's filings with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Fund undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein. There is no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be attained.

      limited partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as 
      partnerships and their affiliates, and other companies that derive at

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

							Morningstar has awarded this fund 1 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 25 funds within its Morningstar Energy Limited Partnership Category.
						


How is it determined?

							A fund's Overall Morningstar Rating (TM) is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology.

							A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.
