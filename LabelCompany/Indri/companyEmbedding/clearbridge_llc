What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice.

ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Portfolios

Share



















Overview 












		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Overview









The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Portfolios seek high-quality, large-company stocks that can provide the potential for solid long-term performance.
 









		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Philosophy










Invest in leadership companies where we believe the market price underestimates the magnitude of future growth
Use stock selection as primary driver – identify category leaders with characteristics to sustain that position
Find secular tailwinds to support multi-year investment opportunities, allowing for compounding of earnings and cash flow
Perform rigorous analysis to understand company fundamentals, key competitive dynamics and industry structure

Believe that the best business models win over time

Identify barriers to entry and prefer companies with innovation prowess, regardless of size
Look for businesses that protect and grow market share consistently
Gravitate to self-funding business models with significant recurring revenue

Seek businesses with the ability to generate solid free cash flow over time

Stress test the sustainability of profitability and growth

Take a disciplined approach to valuation
 









		    	Portfolio
		    	
		    	Positioning










Designed for investors seeking long-term capital appreciation through investments in large-capitalization companies with the potential for future earnings growth
Long-term, buy-and-hold approach results in lower portfolio turnover

 





Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
Market, security and/or other investment considerations may result in higher turnover from time to time. Also, all capitalization ranges will not necessarily be represented in an individual account.
There is no guarantee that the Portfolio's objectives will be met.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments involve risk, including loss of principal and there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met.  Investments may also be made in ADRs and other securities of non-U.S. companies in developed and emerging markets which involve risks in addition to those ordinarily associated with investing in domestic securities, including the potentially negative effects of currency fluctuation, political and economic developments, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other financial standards. These  risks are magnified in emerging markets.  









Highlights 


Investment Strategy
Invests primarily in "blue chip," large-cap companies that are dominant in their industries

Investment Objective
Seeks long-term capital growth of capital

Investment Process
Emphasizes security selection and fundamental, bottom-up analysis to identify companies with the potential to grow market share and earnings in the U.S. and overseas

Benchmark
Russell 1000 Growth Index

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Management and performance of individual accounts may vary for reasons that include the existence of different implementation practices and model requirements in different investment programs.
Pure Gross performance shown does not reflect the deduction of investment management fees and certain transaction costs, which will reduce portfolio performance. Net performance includes the deduction of a 3% annual wrap fee for equity and balanced portfolios and a 1.5% annual wrap fee for fixed income portfolios. These deducted fees amounts are the maximum anticipated wrap fees. Actual fees may vary. For fee schedules, contact your financial professional or, if you enter into an agreement directly with Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, LLC ("LMPPG"), refer to LMPPG's Form ADV disclosure document. Returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.

An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. 
Please see GIPS® endnotes for important additional information regarding the portfolio performance shown and for effects of fees. 

Performance Source: Legg Mason
Hypothetical growth of dollars: For illustrative purposes only. Assumes no withdrawals or contributions. The performance results shown were calculated assuming reinvestment of dividends and income and take into account both realized and unrealized capital gains and losses.

























IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) are investment services provided by Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, LLC (LMPPG), a federally registered investment adviser. Client portfolios are managed based on investment instructions or advice provided by one or more of the following Legg Mason-affiliated sub-advisers: ClearBridge Investments, and Western Asset Management Company. Management is implemented by LMPPG, the designated sub-adviser or, in the case of certain programs, the program sponsor or its designee.

Professional money management may not be suitable for all investors. Factual information relating to the securities discussed was obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no guarantee as to its accuracy. It should not be assumed that investments made in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of the securities discussed in the material.

*Pure gross of fee returns do not reflect the deduction of any expenses, including transaction costs, and are presented as supplemental to the net of fee returns.
Compliance Statement:
ClearBridge Investments, LLC claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. ClearBridge Investments, LLC has been independently verified for the periods January 1, 1997 - December 31, 2015. The verification reports are available upon request.
Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
Firm Information:
ClearBridge Investments, LLC ("ClearBridge") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc. ("Legg Mason"). The investment advisory business now known as ClearBridge was registered in September 2005 to facilitate Legg Mason's acquisition of substantially all the equity asset management businesses known as Citigroup Asset Management. These former businesses serve as the foundation of ClearBridge and its claim of GIPS compliance for institutional accounts through predecessor firms, effective as of January 1997. In June 2008, ClearBridge combined this business with its retail business to form a single GIPS firm. As of April 1, 2013 and January 1, 2016, ClearBridge's affiliates, Global Currents Investment Management, LLC, and ClearBridge, LLC, respectively, have become part of the ClearBridge GIPS firm.
Composite Information:
The ClearBridge Large Cap Growth SMA composite consists of discretionary wrap accounts with an account minimum of US $25,000. Accounts within the composite seek consistent growth of capital while minimizing volatility. Investments are primarily made in U.S. companies, with an objective of outperforming the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The main risks of this strategy are General Investment Risk and Non-U.S. Investment Risk. Prior to June 2008, the minimum was $5,000.
Input and Calculation Data:
The fee schedule currently in effect is 3.00% on all assets. Net of fee composite returns are calculated by reducing each monthly composite pure gross rate of return by the highest "bundled" fee charged (3.00%) annually, prorated to a monthly ratio. The "bundled" fee includes transaction costs, investment management, custodial, and other administrative fees. The pure gross return reflects the deduction of transaction costs for some accounts in the composite. Effective January 1, 2013, the number of portfolios reflects a change from prior periods due to an aggregation of accounts as reported by one sponsor. As of January 2014, the internal dispersion of annual returns is measured by the asset-weighted standard deviation of portfolio returns included in the composite for the entire year. For prior years, the equal-weighted standard deviation was used. Total firm assets for 2007 represents the CBI-Retail firm. The composite employed a 10% significant cash flow policy which was discontinued in January 2012. A list of composite descriptions is available upon request. Policies for valuing portfolios, calcul ating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Benchmark Information:
The Russell 1000® Growth Index measures the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values









All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s webpage for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Short selling is a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

 An XBRL file is not a fund's complete prospectus. XBRL is an interactive data format and is provided in addition to a fund's prospectus and annual and semi-annual reports linked to this page. An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.

A Matter of Principle
The principles that guide us at ClearBridge are simple. That leaves us free to focus on execution — research, stock selection and risk management.



All active is not created equal


Principle 1
All active is not created equal
A remarkable number of active strategies don't stray much from their benchmarks. At ClearBridge, we believe active should look different. We invest selectively in the highest-conviction ideas of our portfolio managers and have been doing so for more than 50 years. 




It's not just what you own, it's also what you don't


Principle 2
It's not just what you own, it's also what you don't
Indexes are not good guides to opportunity. They don't distinguish between weak and strong companies. Especially in turbulent times, the value of actively avoiding less desirable businesses is clear.




Patience is still a virtue


Principle 3
Patience is still a virtue
Successful business owners take a long view. So we look for stocks worth holding for years or even decades, and invest heavily in research to support our convictions.  Low turnover reflects this active decision to be patient.




Insist on quality


Principle 4
Insist on quality
A positive tide can lift all boats for a few quarters. But do companies have what it takes to grow over time? We look for balance sheets, business plans and cash flows to thrive over the long term.




Fundamentals are fundamental


Principle 5
Fundamentals are fundamental
We invest as business owners. This involves constantly working to uncover and understand the fundamental strengths behind the companies we own. We embrace this commitment with a passion.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
