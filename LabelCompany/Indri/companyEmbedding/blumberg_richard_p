Cole PSdavidwhitejr ratedI was referred to Richard Cole...I was referred to Richard Cole through Legal Voice as a lawyer, who was willing to do one day only representation. I also highly recommend Legal Voice as the best non-profit organization for getting legal advice and referrals to attorneys for free. After leaving a voice message for Richard on a Friday, he said he had an opening and could be my legal representative for my 9 am court hearing on Monday. Although it was Easter weekend and he was spending time with his family, he contacted me over a dozen times per email to get details about the court hearing. We met before the court hearing and Richard was very focused on getting the details from me he needed to achieve a successful outcome. He has the experience to get straight to the point.  During the court hearing, I noticed he had a stack of legal printouts with yellow sticky notes, which demonstrated to me, he had really invested time into preparing for a one day only representation and was not out to just, earn a flat fee without working for it. Richard Cole is a rare, excellent, experienced lawyer who cares and works hard for his clients. I was so impressed by his work ethic. I then hired him to represent me on additional legal issues and each time I asked for his help he provided service that knocked my socks off. Richard has stopped me from making mistakes in my court cases and in my decisions.  I personally do not want a lawyer who does not have the strength of character to tell me when I am doing something that will not produce positive outcomes. Richard gives practical advice. He emphasizes staying focused and professional in approaching a problem. I hope this review has been helpful and one day Richard Cole can help you also. I was encouraged by Legal Voice to not thank them but to thank the lawyer they referred me to.Bienstock Law, LLCZ O. ratedThe best divorce attorney in SeattleBefore I found Ms. Kristen, I had consulted with 5 other attorneys. I initially consulted with her on the phone and 3 minutes into the conversation I knew she was the "one." Through Ms. Kristen, I have filed for dissolution, temporary orders and a domestic violence protection order. It's a very complex divorce case. She had the most knowledge out of all of the attorneys I had spoken with. She knew about jurisdiction and emergency jurisdiction laws, not just for the state of Washington but out of state as well. She has much experience in relocation (with children). She is fierce, strong and fights for me like I am her family. She has given me many options and scenarios so I never feel overwhelmed and know what is coming/expected.  Whenever things don't go as planned she comes up with something to remedy it. She makes me feel comfortable and is always available (email, phone, & even text). She listens, is caring and works very hard. My husband holds an esteemed position in the community and she is never intimated about going up against him. She has many years of experience and I would not trust anyone else with my family law issues from this point on. I highly recommend her.  She is worth EVERY penny!!Law Office of Eric J. Schurmanfreeandhappy ratedI obviously didn't meet Eric S...I obviously didn't meet Eric Schurman during the best of times, but I can't recommend him enough for making a painful period a lot easier to get through.  I found him through his positive reviews online, and now I’m glad to be able to add my voice to the growing chorus of praise.  He handled my case with professionalism and compassion, understanding how difficult this time was for me. His knowledge of the law and of my rights gave me confidence and put me at ease throughout the process. His response time to phone calls and emails is amazingly swift, which made me feel less like ‘just another client’ and more like I was being taken care of. Eric displayed a thorough command of the law and a gift for delivering measured, wise counsel at every step. His even-tempered and compassionate demeanor was also reassuring—and even better, he won our case! I am so thankful I had him on my side.  I would recommend Eric to my closest friends knowing they would be in good hands.Charles H. Williams, Attorney and Counselor at Law, P.S.Jeffrey Z. ratedCharles Williams is an excellent attorney. I hired him because I knew he had a great reputation and the fact that he was also named "Attorney of the Year" by his peers didn't hurt either. He assisted my son in a serious matter that not only could have prevented him from attending college, but also would have had long-term ramifications for years to come. Charles was able to find a resolution that was fair and reasonable and gave my son the opportunity to attend college and to move forward as a young adult without a black mark on his name. Not only did the judge comment on the fast resolution in the case, but the Prosecutor went out of his way to tell me that I had hired an excellent attorney. Equally important in my view was the wisdom he shared with my son about choices in life --  how to make the right ones, and how to avoid the wrong ones. He has taken that to heart and thanks to Charles is heading in the right direction with a bright future ahead of him.Law Offices of Kevin Tromboldruslan ratedMOST OUTSTANDING AND TRUSTWORT...MOST OUTSTANDING AND TRUSTWORTHY LAWYER!Kevin has taken care of many of my criminal cases, starting from a Negligent Driving to Wreckless to DWI. I worked with other lawyers, actually 7 to be exact, and no one even comes close to Kevin's expertise. He worked and works very hard in order to get a ticket dismissed or reduced the least to say. He has been a very thorough and very knowledgeable attorney. He has dismissed and/or reduced all of the the cases in which I hired him to represent me! He is the Best! The Only Attorney I would hire to represent me in any criminal court. He has done a superb job, and I am very happy to have such an understandable at the same time aggressive lawyer that will do everything in his power to help you! Goldberg & Jonesdanroberts ratedWhen I first came to Goldberg ...When I first came to Goldberg Jones, I was looking for a custody attorney who would represent me without being too aggressive and expensive. I had already interviewed several attorneys and was rapidly getting discouraged in my search. That's when I met Scott Marlow. His affable, yet straight forward approach to my situation put me at ease, which gave me the reassurance that he would represent my interests without any drama and/or courtroom theatrics. Scott always presented me with several options that were thoroughly researched and often took the conservative approach. Thanks to Scott's outstanding knowledge of family law and personable character, I now have full custody of my two children. Thank you Scott!Law Office of Eric J. Schurmanj.d_man ratedTheir is not enough good things in the world to describe this Fantastic Lawyer. I was very impressed with his KNOWLEDGE of the law and his take charge approach. I was looking at  many years in jail and Eric sent me home a free man with little jail time. I am totally mind blown by what this guy has done for me and my family. This is not a slime ball lawyer  just tell him the truth and he will be honest with you. Yea it's going to cost you but Its worth every penny. If you got a brain in your head and your back against the wall. I am telling you this is the go to guy.Thank you a million times Eric Brown, Stuartbshowers ratedStuart Brown sets aside the st...Stuart Brown sets aside the stereo types you think of when you hear the title "Lawyer". Stuart has redefined that titled for me and my family the day my wife and I walked into his office 3 years ago. He took the time to meet with us, did not rush us out of his office, as if we were just another paycheck/ ticket for him. We spent 2 years in custody court fighting for my daughter. With Stuart's dedication to my family and I, we were able to remove my daughter from a dangerous situation and bring her home. My family and I will forever be in debt to Stuart Brown and his staff. Lynn Pollocknk1030 ratedAfter working with Lynn this past year, I told several friends about her wonderful service and support.  They were surprised because they had read some bad reviews about Lynn and her firm.  I now see what they were referring to and I must say I am very disappointed that more of her clients haven't responded to this negative bashing of a fine attorney.  Lynn was recommended to me by SEVERAL high-profile lawyers in King County and my experience with both Lynn and her assistant, Robin, was not only helpful but reassuring.I would recommend her in a heart beat.Goldberg & Jonesbazillionaire.mooney ratedNatalie Rasmussen2 years ago I retained Natalie Rasmussen for my child support modification case. I tried to represent myself 2 previous times and was unsuccessful. It was a very stressful time for me and my family. Natalie helped me through the case and was honest. She always let me know which way it could go good or bad. In the end she won the case for me. Natalie is so professional and great at her job that other dads waiting for their case to be heard wanted to hire her. I appreciate everything she has done for me and I highly recommend Natalie Rasmussen.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
