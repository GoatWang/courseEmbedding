History
An ally through the years







From our beginnings in auto finance to our expansion into online banking, credit and lending and wealth management, our commitment to customers has been our focus for nearly a century.





1920s – 1930s
Starting our engines






Helping auto dealers be successful
The invention of the assembly line changed the way the auto industry did business. To keep factories running smoothly, manufacturers needed auto dealers to buy vehicles in large quantities. In 1919, we opened our doors as GMAC, a division of GM, to help dealers finance and maintain their inventory and keep up with consumer demand.
Making auto financing more accessible
In the early 1920s, people looking to buy a car or truck had to pay cash or secure their own financing from banks that didn’t typically issue loans for automobiles. We made it convenient for customers to get financing right at the dealership. During the Great Depression, car manufactures began segmenting vehicles by cost, from low-price to luxury models. We introduced this pricing concept to the public with our slogan "A car for every purse and purpose."


1919
Opened our doors in New York City and later that year added offices in Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco and Toronto 
1924
Financed our 4 millionth vehicle
1939
Formed Motors Insurance Corporation (MIC) 


            Detroit Car Factory – 1910s
        







1940s – 1950s
Financing beyond cars






Meeting the needs of the time
During World War II, we helped support the war effort as the financing arm of GM, which supplied the Allies with submarine engines, airplanes, trucks and tanks. Back home, we helped financially troubled railroads stay in business by renting and financing locomotives. In the 1950s, we diversified and worked with participating household appliance retailers and extended financing to customers who couldn't afford to buy a refrigerator, washer or stove outright.
Providing convenience and more options
Americans' love for cars was on the rise during the golden years of automobile design. With our slogan, ''Enjoy financing where you buy,'' more people took advantage of getting the car they wanted and the financing they needed at the same place. In 1956 we introduced "Buying cars on time" with our Time Payment Plan and gave over 2 million customers more options to finance a vehicle with a payment plan that fit their budget.


1941
Financed locomotives during WWII
1951
Financed household appliances through participating retailers
1956
Introduced the Time Payment Plan


            Honolulu Clipper - 1939
        







1960s – 1970s
Ensuring peace of mind



Protecting vehicles inside and out
As car manufacturers pushed innovation and style, auto prices rose and insurance became an increasingly important part of our products and services offering. Our Motors Insurance Corporation provided dealers with physical damage coverage to protect the vehicles they sold, and in the mid 1960s we became the first insurance company to offer comprehensive coverage to dealers' customers. In 1973, we introduced mechanical coverage for new vehicles and for certain used vehicles.

1973

1977
Financed our 75 millionth vehicle

1980s – 1990s 
Exploring new roads



Expanding our financing capabilities
In the 1980s we leased the auto industry's first electric-powered cars. We also expanded our business to include mortgage lending, helping thousands of Americans become homeowners. In the late 1990s, we purchased The Bank of New York's lending unit. This led to the creation of our Corporate Finance division that soon became one of the most trusted sources of capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies.


1985
Financed our 100 millionth vehicle
Offered loans to home buyers
1999
Formed our Corporate Finance division


            Print Ad - 1989
        







2000s – 2010s
Beginning a transformation



Examining our strengths
During one of the most significant economic downturns our country experienced, we were tested like many other financial services companies. For us, it was an opportunity to review our business model, define our competitive advantages and build on our strengths.
Building a better bank
The world didn't need another bank — it needed a better one. We decided to make a stand on our commitment to customers and put our promise in our name. So we transformed our banking subsidiary into Ally Bank on 3 simple principles: do right, talk straight and be obviously better. As an online bank without physical branch locations, we were able to offer greater value with consistently competitive rates and convenient around-the-clock support when our customers needed it.


2000
Established GMAC Bank
Launched SmartAuction, our unique online remarketing tool for dealers
2001
Reached $1 trillion in financing for 150 million vehicles
2009
Transformed GMAC Bank into Ally Bank

Redefining our company
In 2010, we rebranded as Ally Financial and transformed our auto finance business into Ally Auto — a premier independent finance provider offering dealers of many vehicle makes, including RVs, the most comprehensive suite of products and services available. With our transformation complete, we became a publicly traded company with a diverse mix of investors in 2014.


2010
Renamed our company Ally Financial
2012
Exceeded 1 million Ally Bank customer accounts
2013
Granted financial holding company status

  Ally Financial Inc. ALLY  is slated to announce second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Its revenues are projected to rise year over year, while earnings are expected to fall marginally.    Escalated expenses and higher provisions largely led Ally Financial's first-quarter earnings to lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher net revenues supported results to some extent.    Analysts seem to be happy with the company's business activities in the just concluded quarter. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable over the last 30 days. Also, the stock has a decent earnings surprise history. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.9%.    Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        Ally Financial Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Ally Financial Inc. Quote  Further, the company's price performance has been decent as well. Its shares have jumped 15% so far this year against the industry  's decline of 1.9%.      Factors at Play   Lower used vehicle prices to hurt results:  With management's expectations of decline in used vehicle prices, Ally Financial's earnings are likely to be adversely impacted to some extent as it primarily deals in auto loans.    Further, lease revenues are projected to fall during the quarter owing to a smaller lease portfolio as well as lower used vehicle value.   Higher rates to support net interest income (NII):  Given the higher interest rates and Ally Financial's efforts to diversify into mortgage business, NII is expected increase in the second quarter.   Operating expenses to rise:  Ally Financial has been making efforts to grow inorganically, introduce new products and diversify operations. Given these initiatives, the company will likely witness an increase in operating expenses. Management expects expenses to be $760 million in the second quarter.   Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ally Financial is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That's because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as elaborated below.

Ally Financial Launches Innovative Vehicle Financing Product
Ally Buyer's Choice product to debut initially in five U.S. markets
Oct 31, 2011



DETROIT, Oct. 31, 2011 -- Ally Financial Inc. launches Ally Buyer's Choice, an industry-first product offering for U.S. dealers and customers on new 2011 and 2012 General Motors and Chrysler vehicles.  
Ally Buyer's Choice is an innovative financing product that delivers the best of both worlds for customers who want the advantages of both buying and leasing.
Ally Buyer's Choice allows customers to own their vehicle with a fixed rate and payment with the option to sell it to Ally at the 48th month of their contract, at a pre-determined price. The product is ideal for customers interested in purchasing a vehicle, rather than leasing, but provides the flexibility during the ownership experience to sell the vehicle to Ally, should their needs or preferences change.
"Ally Buyer's Choice is a true differentiator in the market and provides great flexibility and choice for consumers," said Tim Russi, executive vice president, North American Operations for Ally Financial. "Ally is committed to bringing industry-first products to market that offer consumers more choices and help dealers sell and service more vehicles."  
Vehicle financing terms through Ally can range from 60 months and 84 months. Customers can elect to sell their vehicle to Ally or continue making monthly payments for the duration of the finance contract, if they wish to keep their vehicle.
Ally Buyer's Choice also provides another flexible financing option for dealers to offer customers, allowing them to meet a variety of customer needs. The product can reduce the customer's buying cycle time, increasing showroom traffic and vehicle service opportunities.
Ally Buyer's Choice will debut in California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. Additional markets will be added over the coming months.
Customers in the initial markets who are interested in finding out if Ally Buyer's Choice is right for them can visit any GM- or Chrysler-affiliated dealers.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1919 by General Motors Corporation as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to be a provider of financing to automotive customers. Original offices were located in Detroit, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto.[3] Over the following decades the business expanded to include insurance, online banking, mortgage operations, and commercial finance.
In 1985, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage.[4] In 1999, GMAC Mortgage purchased Ditech Funding [5] In 2005, the company formed Residential Capital (ResCap) as a holding company for its mortgage operations.[6]
In 2006, General Motors Corporation sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Also that year, GMAC divested a controlling interest of GMAC Commercial Holdings, its real estate division, and Capmark Financial Group to Goldman Sachs, KKR and Five Mile Capital Partners.[7] In 2009, Capmark filed for bankruptcy and its North American loan origination and servicing business was acquired by Berkadia, a joint venture of Leucadia and Berkshire Hathaway.[8]
On December 24, 2008, the Federal Reserve accepted the company's application to become a bank holding company.[9] As a result of losses in the company's former ResCap subsidiary, the United States Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008-2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment.[10]
On May 15, 2009, GMAC's banking unit changed its name to Ally Bank. In May 2010, GMAC re-branded itself as Ally Financial.[11] In 2012, the company sold its Canadian banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada.[12] The company became a public company in April 2014.[13] In 2015, it moved its headquarters to One Detroit Center, Michigan.[14]
In June 2016 Ally acquired TradeKing, an online brokerage, which was rebranded as Ally Invest.[15]
Current operations[edit]
Ally Auto[edit]
Along with Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Capital One, and JP Morgan Chase, Ally is one of the top bank auto lenders in the U.S. by volume.[16] The company offers financial services, such as retail auto financing and leasing, dealer lines of credit, insurance coverage, and vehicle auction services. Customers included over 18,000 automotive dealerships and 4.4 million retail consumers.[1]
The company owns SmartAuction, a platform for live auto auctions via a website and mobile app. More than 5 million vehicles have been sold since it launched in 2000[17] and 364,000 vehicles were sold in 2016.[1]
Ally Bank[edit]
Ally Bank is a direct bank with $66.6 billion in retail customer deposits.[1] Ally Bank offers savings products, including certificates of deposit (CDs), online savings accounts, interest checking accounts, money market accounts, mortgages, and credit cards. Ally Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[1]
Ally Corporate Finance[edit]
The company's corporate finance division provides capital to businesses in various industries.[1]
Ally Invest[edit]
Ally Invest is an online discount brokerage firm. Investors can buy and sell such securities as stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds and trade on the foreign exchange market via its electronic trading platform.
Legal issues[edit]
2013 discrimination settlement[edit]
In December 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a settlement with Ally Financial to resolve alleged discrimination in its indirect auto lending program. According to the consent order, Ally charged African American borrowers an average of 29 basis points more than similarly situated White borrowers, Hispanic borrowers 20 basis points more than White borrowers, and Asian/Pacific Islanders 22 basis points more than White borrowers. The CFPB concluded that these disparities were statistically significant, based on race, and not based on creditworthiness or objective criteria related to borrower risk. The CFPB also alleged that the higher markups resulted from Ally’s specific policy and practice of allowing dealers to mark up a consumer’s interest rate above Ally’s established buy rate and then compensating dealers based on the markup. Under the terms of the consent order, Ally was required to establish a compliance committee, submit a compliance plan to the CFPB and United States Department of Justice for review, and pay $80 million in consumer monetary damages and $18 million in civil penalties.[18]
Sponsorships[edit]
Ally sponsors the Miami Auto Show.[19]
Ally sponsors the Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award through 2021.[20]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1919 by General Motors Corporation as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to be a provider of financing to automotive customers. Original offices were located in Detroit, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto.[3] Over the following decades the business expanded to include insurance, online banking, mortgage operations, and commercial finance.
In 1985, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage.[4] In 1999, GMAC Mortgage purchased Ditech Funding [5] In 2005, the company formed Residential Capital (ResCap) as a holding company for its mortgage operations.[6]
In 2006, General Motors Corporation sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Also that year, GMAC divested a controlling interest of GMAC Commercial Holdings, its real estate division, and Capmark Financial Group to Goldman Sachs, KKR and Five Mile Capital Partners.[7] In 2009, Capmark filed for bankruptcy and its North American loan origination and servicing business was acquired by Berkadia, a joint venture of Leucadia and Berkshire Hathaway.[8]
On December 24, 2008, the Federal Reserve accepted the company's application to become a bank holding company.[9] As a result of losses in the company's former ResCap subsidiary, the United States Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008-2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment.[10]
On May 15, 2009, GMAC's banking unit changed its name to Ally Bank. In May 2010, GMAC re-branded itself as Ally Financial.[11] In 2012, the company sold its Canadian banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada.[12] The company became a public company in April 2014.[13] In 2015, it moved its headquarters to One Detroit Center, Michigan.[14]

Legal issues[edit]
2013 discrimination settlement[edit]
In December 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a settlement with Ally Financial to resolve alleged discrimination in its indirect auto lending program. According to the consent order, Ally charged African American borrowers an average of 29 basis points more than similarly situated White borrowers, Hispanic borrowers 20 basis points more than White borrowers, and Asian/Pacific Islanders 22 basis points more than White borrowers. The CFPB concluded that these disparities were statistically significant, based on race, and not based on creditworthiness or objective criteria related to borrower risk. The CFPB also alleged that the higher markups resulted from Ally’s specific policy and practice of allowing dealers to mark up a consumer’s interest rate above Ally’s established buy rate and then compensating dealers based on the markup. Under the terms of the consent order, Ally was required to establish a compliance committee, submit a compliance plan to the CFPB and United States Department of Justice for review, and pay $80 million in consumer monetary damages and $18 million in civil penalties.[18]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1919 by General Motors Corporation as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to be a provider of financing to automotive customers. Original offices were located in Detroit, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto.[3] Over the following decades the business expanded to include insurance, online banking, mortgage operations, and commercial finance.
In 1985, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage.[4] In 1999, GMAC Mortgage purchased Ditech Funding [5] In 2005, the company formed Residential Capital (ResCap) as a holding company for its mortgage operations.[6]
In 2006, General Motors Corporation sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Also that year, GMAC divested a controlling interest of GMAC Commercial Holdings, its real estate division, and Capmark Financial Group to Goldman Sachs, KKR and Five Mile Capital Partners.[7] In 2009, Capmark filed for bankruptcy and its North American loan origination and servicing business was acquired by Berkadia, a joint venture of Leucadia and Berkshire Hathaway.[8]
On December 24, 2008, the Federal Reserve accepted the company's application to become a bank holding company.[9] As a result of losses in the company's former ResCap subsidiary, the United States Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008-2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment.[10]
On May 15, 2009, GMAC's banking unit changed its name to Ally Bank. In May 2010, GMAC re-branded itself as Ally Financial.[11] In 2012, the company sold its Canadian banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada.[12] The company became a public company in April 2014.[13] In 2015, it moved its headquarters to One Detroit Center, Michigan.[14]
In June 2016 Ally acquired TradeKing, an online brokerage, which was rebranded as Ally Invest.[15]
Current operations[edit]
Ally Auto[edit]
Along with Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Capital One, and JP Morgan Chase, Ally is one of the top bank auto lenders in the U.S. by volume.[16] The company offers financial services, such as retail auto financing and leasing, dealer lines of credit, insurance coverage, and vehicle auction services. Customers included over 18,000 automotive dealerships and 4.4 million retail consumers.[1]
The company owns SmartAuction, a platform for live auto auctions via a website and mobile app. More than 5 million vehicles have been sold since it launched in 2000[17] and 364,000 vehicles were sold in 2016.[1]
Ally Bank[edit]
Ally Bank is a direct bank with $66.6 billion in retail customer deposits.[1] Ally Bank offers savings products, including certificates of deposit (CDs), online savings accounts, interest checking accounts, money market accounts, mortgages, and credit cards. Ally Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[1]
Ally Corporate Finance[edit]
The company's corporate finance division provides capital to businesses in various industries.[1]
Ally Invest[edit]
Ally Invest is an online discount brokerage firm. Investors can buy and sell such securities as stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds and trade on the foreign exchange market via its electronic trading platform.
Legal issues[edit]
2013 discrimination settlement[edit]
In December 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a settlement with Ally Financial to resolve alleged discrimination in its indirect auto lending program. According to the consent order, Ally charged African American borrowers an average of 29 basis points more than similarly situated White borrowers, Hispanic borrowers 20 basis points more than White borrowers, and Asian/Pacific Islanders 22 basis points more than White borrowers. The CFPB concluded that these disparities were statistically significant, based on race, and not based on creditworthiness or objective criteria related to borrower risk. The CFPB also alleged that the higher markups resulted from Ally’s specific policy and practice of allowing dealers to mark up a consumer’s interest rate above Ally’s established buy rate and then compensating dealers based on the markup. Under the terms of the consent order, Ally was required to establish a compliance committee, submit a compliance plan to the CFPB and United States Department of Justice for review, and pay $80 million in consumer monetary damages and $18 million in civil penalties.[18]
Sponsorships[edit]
Ally sponsors the Miami Auto Show.[19]
Ally sponsors the Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award through 2021.[20]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
