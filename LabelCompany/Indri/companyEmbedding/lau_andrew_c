 Educational Background



 


University of California - Berkeley

                  University of California Berkeley

National rankings: In a National Research Council analysis of 212 doctoral programs at American universities, 48 Berkeley programs place among the top 10 nationwide.

Faculty awards and honors: There are 8 Nobel Laureates, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners among the current faculty.

History of UC Berkeley: Historical highlights, arranged by topic, following the campus's development — from UC's founding in 1868 to a turn-of-the-century building boom, a research explosion in the 1930s, the Free Speech Movement of the '60s, and Berkeley's key role today in science and technology revolutions.

Timeline of discoveries and contributions by UC Berkeley scholars.

Traditions of Cal: Who was the Angel of Death? What's with the "Big C" up there in the hills — and why is it sometimes green? Who wears Oski's jolly bear head and size 54 yellow sweater?

Tours and webcams: Check out what's happening on Sproul Plaza, the campus's true heart. See stunning live views of the Bay Area from the Lawrence Hall of Science's perch in the Berkeley hills.

Chancellor and administration: Information on Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost George W. Breslauer, and how the university is organized. Organizational charts are included.

UC System overview and links: On the campuses, laboratories, and medical centers that comprise UC's public educational system, as well as UC's K-12 partnerships, economic impact, and agriculture and environmental resources.

They really paid a lot of attention to my problem area, which is the reason I went. When I told them where I was in pain they put much of their focus on eliminating discomfort in that area. I feel like they go out of their way to accommodate my schedule. I always get the appointment time I want. It's always nice to have comfortable chairs to sit in while you are waiting to visit the chiropractor. I appreciate the fact that they invested in comfy chairs. They made the extra effort to make sure every question and concern I had was addressed.

                            Did you feel like your pain was lessened after your chiropractic treatment?
                        

                            Yes, I felt better than I've felt in years when I left!
                        

                            Did this provider answer all of your questions?
                        

                            Every question I had was answered thoroughly
                        

                            Was this provider's staff friendly?
                        

                            Yes
                        

                            Did you leave the office feeling satisfied with your visit?
                        

                            Completely!
                        

                            Was this provider's office easy to locate?

They really paid a lot of attention to my problem area, which is the reason I went. When I told them where I was in pain they put much of their focus on eliminating discomfort in that area. I feel like they go out of their way to accommodate my schedule. I always get the appointment time I want. It's always nice to have comfortable chairs to sit in while you are waiting to visit the chiropractor. I appreciate the fact that they invested in comfy chairs. They made the extra effort to make sure every question and concern I had was addressed.
