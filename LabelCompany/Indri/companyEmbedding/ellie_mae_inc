                    In 2015, we increased our volume by 40% over the prior year, and we did it with less staff and while staying in compliance with TRID. That’s a direct result of the way we use Encompass.                    – Becky Helvey, Senior Vice President of Administration, Prosperity Home Mortgage

The Total Quality Loan advantage
Investors demand loan quality, and you’re on the hook to deliver. The Total Quality Loan® (TQL®) program in Encompass uses an automated, best-practice workflow to help you:

Produce higher-quality, compliant loans that investors can buy with confidence
Quickly get your loans purchased and off your warehouse line
Easily export proof of ATR/QM compliance to investors or for audit purposes







Close loans faster
With origination costs now eclipsing $7,080 per loan (according to the MBA), efficiency is the key to profitability. An independent study revealed that Encompass increased efficiency by delivering up to:

$970.14 potential savings and value per loan comprising:
$612.83 in asset quality and execution improvement
$357.31 in improved efficiencies and cost-savings











When we changed to Encompass, we had a loan volume of $250 million a year and a 10-person compliance department, which we got down to one person. Today, I have a seven-person compliance department handling 650 loans, representing $100 million in volume every month. I would need a compliance department three times that size if not for Ellie Mae and Encompass.
– Jeanie Nivison, COO, VanDyk Mortgage

      The percentage of purchase home loans relative to refinances remained 
      steady at 68 percent of all closed loans according to the June Origination 
      Insight Report released by Ellie 
      Mae® (NYSE:ELLI), a leading provider of innovative 
      on-demand software solutions and services for the residential mortgage 
      industry. The percentage of refinances remained at 32 percent for the 
      second straight month.
    

      Specifically, the percentage of Conventional purchase loans increased to 
      63 percent, up two percentage points from the prior month. FHA purchase 
      loans decreased slightly to 81 percent, and VA purchase loans increased 
      to 75 percent.
    

      The average 30-year note continued to decrease to 4.27 in June, down 
      from 4.33 in May. The percentage of Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) on 
      all loans declined to 5.9 percent in June, down from 6.1 percent the 
      month prior. Additionally, the average time to close all loans increased 
      by one day to 43 days in June. The time to close a refinance held at 41 
      days, while the time to close a purchase increased to 43 days.
    

      “While low inventory levels are slowing the growth of home purchases, 
      the percentage of home loan purchases stayed steady in June, 
      representing 68 percent of total closed loans,” said Jonathan Corr, 
      president and CEO of Ellie Mae.
    

      The Origination Insight Report mines its application data from a 
      robust sampling of approximately 80 percent of all mortgage applications 
      that were initiated on the Encompass® 
      all-in-one mortgage management solution. Ellie Mae believes the Origination 
      Insight Report is a strong proxy of the underwriting standards 
      employed by lenders across the country.
    

      Ellie Mae also distributes data from its monthly Ellie Mae Millennial 
      Tracker, which focuses on mortgage applications submitted by 
      millennials during specific time periods. Ellie Mae defines millennials 
      as applicants born between the years 1980 and 1999. The Millennial 
      Tracker will continue to be released on the first Wednesday of each 
      month.

More information and analysis of closed and denied loans by loan 
      purpose and investor are available in the full report at http://www.elliemae.com/about-us/news-reports/ellie-mae-reports/.


      To get a meaningful view of lender pull-through, Ellie Mae reviewed a 
      sampling of loan applications initiated 90 days prior—or the March 2017 
      applications—to calculate an overall closing rate of 70 percent in June 
      2017 (see full report).
    

About the Ellie Mae Origination Insight Report


      The Origination Insight Report focuses on loans that closed in a 
      specific month and compares their characteristics to similar loans that 
      closed three and six months earlier. The closing rate is calculated on a 
      90-day cycle rather than on a monthly basis because most loan 
      applications typically take one-and-a-half to two months from 
      application to closing. Loans that do not close could still be active 
      applications or applications withdrawn by consumers or denied for 
      incompleteness or non-qualification.
    

      The Origination Insight Report details aggregated anonymized data 
      pulled from Ellie Mae’s Encompass origination platform.
