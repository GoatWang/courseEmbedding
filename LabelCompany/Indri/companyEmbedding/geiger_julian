The company was founded in 1878, when brothers Andrew and Jacob took over their father’s two-room print shop in Newark, New Jersey. A staff of 4 – the brothers, a printer, and a bookkeeper – produced a small line that included advertising calendars, fans, and greeting cards. In the early 1900s, the second generation brothers, Frank, Charles, and George added date books and diaries to their expanding line. In 1930s, Frank's two sons, Ray and Frank, led the firm into the distribution of advertising specialty products made by other companies. Meanwhile, Ray acquired the famous Farmers' Almanac™, becoming its 6th editor and tireless promoter for 60 consecutive years! In 1955, the company moved to its current location in Lewiston, Maine. Two of Ray’s sons, Gene and Peter, manage the company today. Under their guidance, Geiger has experienced unprecedented growth and success which has earned numerous business and civic honors.Each generation has enhanced and reinvigorated the business, but the Geigers themselves are only part of the story. Some 500 talented associates work in the Lewiston and field offices supporting a sales force of more than 450 promotional consultants in nearly every state and more than 50,000 customers. The Geiger WayCustomer Focus1.

We want their experience to be: “simple, smooth, solved.”2. A business of Brandspiration®.

We offer – Brandspiration® - creative and unrelenting brand support.Great Expectations3. Continuous improvement. Every associate is responsible for improving the work they do every day. We will deliver what our customers want when they want it – and eliminate anything that diminishes that effort.4. Standard of excellence. More important than size, we want to be the firm – the standard of excellence – against which others are measured.Respectful and Responsible5. Valuing people. Our associates are by far our most value asset. We will hire talented people, train and empower them, and recognize their accomplishments. We want a safe, healthy workplace, where communication is strong, teamwork is the norm, and innovation energizes.6. A “family” of relationships. A “family” business, we seek the collective benefits that come from mutually-beneficial, long-term affiliations with our associates, sales partners, customers, and suppliers.7. Profit necessity. A reasonable financial return secures the jobs, compensation, and benefits of our associates. It funds reinvestment and allows for growth. We will share our profits with those who help create them.8. Giving back. We will give back to the community from which we have drawn our strengths. As a company and as individuals, we seek to be leaders in education, charity, and civic affairs.9. Doing what is right. Our decisions will be guided by “what is right.” It is good business, as well.Geiger is the only distributor in the “Top 10” for the past 10, 20, and 30 straight years.

Geiger is a socially conscientious company that has been in operation for over 130 years. We appreciate your business and are taking measures to maintain your confidence and trust in our services. You deserve a company that does the best job of providing proactive, comprehensive compliance solutions.Click here to learn more about Geiger's commitment to safety.Geiger has a full-time Product Safety department committed to protecting you and your brand. We strive to provide products that are in compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Initiative (CPSIA), Proposition 65 requirements and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our goal is to enhance and protect your brand, not put the reputation of your brand at risk. You can trust Geiger!Our Pledge To You.A number of high-profile news events have brought to light areas of concern that could potentially impact anyone who distributes products manufactured overseas. As a result, here are the initiatives we are taking to insure the safety of the products we distribute:Preferred Vendors.We have strong relationships with our production partners. These vendors have years of proven experience and are proactive in many areas, including product safety and social compliance. They have put their products through testing beyond that being done by inspectors overseas.Factory Visits.We feel that it is not enough that our key production partners monitor their overseas production facilities. We are also taking on active role by doing factory visits to see firsthand how the products are manufactured, to ensure safe working conditions and responsible labor practices are being met. We also work with FLA-certified sources of supply that have to go through regular, rigorous, independent testing to ensure factories are safe and do not employ “sweatshop” labor practices or child labor.Independent Testing.In some cases an independent testing process is available to further validate prior testing results. These products are tested for lead content as well as other chemicals that could be harmful for the user. Products that will be used by children are tested for child safety. Many of the items tested are products that we use on a regular basis for programs and clients nationwide.OUR COMPANY’S COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT  Our Company believes we must not only meet the expectations of our customers and consumers, we must exceed those expectations. To that end, we have adopted standards for the safety, quality and integrity of our products and processes and we are committed to respecting the rights of individuals and protecting the environment. We are dedicated to complying with all applicable laws and to conduct business in an ethical and responsible manner.                       SHOP BYApparelAuto, Health & HomeBags & TotesDrinkwareFun & OutdoorsOfficeRush ServiceSpecialty StoresTrade Shows & EventsWritingSpecialty StoresCloseoutsCorporate GiftsEco FriendlyHealth Care PromotionsMade in the USAEducationNew ProductsHolidayTop SellersOn SaleAbout GeigerPrivacy PolicyTeam, History, and PhilosophyGeiger CaresGreen InitiativesEmployment Opportunities Become a Sales Partner Our Executive TeamSafety TestimonialsTerms of UseServicesFrequently Asked QuestionsProgram Capabilities Geiger Gets It Geiger ExpoPromo BlogGeiger, Geiger Customer Service, PO Box 1609, Lewiston, ME 04241 | 1-888-953-9340 | geigerorders@geiger.com©2017 GEIGER All Rights Reserved.Geiger Cares | geiger.com

As a company and individuals, we seek to be leaders in education, charity and civic affairs.”Community InvolvementGeiger is committed to making a difference in communities where we live and work and do business. This commitment was emphasized during the opening ceremony at our new Maine facility (April 1955) when Ray Geiger proudly announced that Geiger would be leaders in giving to the community. This has become part of our heritage and is the legacy we leave behind. We volunteer actively, give generously and work to make a difference. Our emphasis has been in business organizations (building our economy), public education, and healthcare.Geiger participates in the following community activities:In 1988 we created the Geiger/Montello Adopt-A-School partnership and received the 618th Point of Light from President George Bush and have honors from every educational organization in Maine including the Maine Teachers Association among many others. The highlight of every year is our Night of the Stars where outstanding writers are brought to the Lewiston Middle School Auditorium by stretch limousine, met by “the media” and awarded “Oscars” to an audience of 700+.Peter Geiger has served on the Maine State Board of Education (Chair) and is currently a board member of Educate Maine former Chair) the leading Business/Education group in the state. Peter is also a board memeber of the Maine State Board of Education.In 2007 the city of Lewiston broke ground for a new state-of-the-art elementary school. Without hesitation the school board selected to name the new school the Raymond A Geiger as a way to show appreciation for all the support that Geiger and the Geiger family have provided the community over the years. The school opened in September 2009 and serves as a model for quality education.We encourage our Associates to be involved in the community, and they are.Industry InvolvementWe encourage our management staff to be involved in business and industry groups.

We feel that it is our responsibility as a company and as individuals to take an active role in becoming more eco-friendly and energy efficient.UPS® carbon neutral shippingGeiger continuously works towards social responsibility and a declining carbon footprint.  As a pioneer in the Promotional Products industry, we have contracted with UPS to have a carbon offset for every package we ship.The carbon emissions of our UPS shipments to every customer and from every supplier will be fully negated resulting in each shipment being carbon neutral.  Due to our package volume, we are one of the top 10 carbon neutral shippers in the U.S. who have a contract with UPS for all of our shipments.UPS calculates the carbon emissions for Geiger’s UPS shipments, then purchases and retires offsets equaling that amount.  Projects include reforestation, renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass, hydroelectric), methane and landfill gas destruction, wastewater treatment and destruction of industrial pollutants.These projects are carefully chosen by UPS to ensure that they are high-quality, meeting international standards.  UPS’s carbon calculation methodology and processes are certified by The CarbonNeutral Company and verified by Societe’ Generale de Surveillance (SGS).For more, visit the UPS carbon neutral shipping website.  Green at GeigerOur company has already achieved significant reductions in energy consumption by, among other things….Automation of boiler circulation pumps and envelope temperature saves 60,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 12,000 gallons of heating fuel/year.New variable speed air compressor saves 95,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/year.Heat reclamation from air compressors saves 3,200 gallons of heating oil/year.Replacement of over 1300 light fixtures with high efficiency units and motion sensors saves over 400,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/yr.Automation of air-conditioning in graphics saves over 50,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity/yr.These changes, alone, result in an annual reduction of electricity usage by 840,000 kilowatt hours and 14,000 gallons of fuel oil. We will keep 816 tons of greenhouse gases out of the air, the equivalent of taking 136 cars off the road.In addition…The company also invested $120,000 to remove 87,000 square feet of roof drain out of the city’s sewer system and 48,000 square feet of roof drain water out of Hart Brook, an endangered inner-city waterway. We have re-piped the entire roof surface drain system out with a new RipRap, Plunge Pool, and Level Lip Spreader at the lower elevation end of our property designed to slow, cool settle, filter and disperse our roof rain water.

NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Aeropostale, Inc. (NYSE:   ARO), a mall-based specialty retailer of casual apparel for young women and men, today announced that Julian R. Geiger has rejoined the Company as Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.  Mr. Geiger also will continue to serve as a member of the Company's Board of Directors.  Aeropostale's Board of Directors and Thomas P. Johnson, mutually agreed that Mr. Johnson will step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of the Company.  Mr. Johnson has agreed to remain available for the Company to ensure a smooth transition.
Karin Hirtler-Garvey, Chairperson of Aeropostale's Board of Directors, stated, "Julian's previous service in the role of CEO combined with his passion for the Aeropostale brand make him an ideal choice to lead this organization.  Julian was the leader of Aeropostale's strategic direction during a period of significant growth, and we are confident in his enthusiasm for the business, his understanding of today's teen retail marketplace and his intuition regarding teen fashion.  We are pleased to have Julian back to help guide Aeropostale, Inc. and further enhance each of the Company's sales channels."   
"During his tenure as CEO, Tom led the Company's strategy to increase its focus on fashion and better connect with today's teen consumer," continued Ms. Hirtler-Garvey. "Tom's leadership and commitment over the past 22 years has helped to establish Aeropostale as one of the leading teen retailers.  On behalf of the Board and the entire Aeropostale family, I would like to thank Tom for his many contributions in developing the Company's brands and special culture." 
Mr. Johnson commented, "I am incredibly honored to have served as CEO of Aeropostale and worked with such an amazing team of people who are as passionate about the Company as I am.  Having spent more than half of my retail career at Aeropostale, it has been incredibly rewarding to see the company grow from a few domestic stores to a global business. I am confident that the strength of the Aeropostale brand and the transformational initiatives we have executed over the past year, including the recent financing and comprehensive cost reduction plan, have set a strong path for Aeropostale to compete successfully in an evolving teen retail market."
"My decision to return to Aeropostale to be its Chief Executive Officer is one that was easy to make," said Mr. Geiger.  "The opportunity for sales and profit growth; the ability to reinforce the Company's special culture; and the chance to work closely with, and influence, the management team and the field organization combine to create a compelling and dynamic challenge.  It is with enormous excitement that I prepare to lead the Aeropostale team into a future filled with optimism and opportunity."
Updates Second Quarter 2014 Outlook
For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, net sales decreased 13% to $396.2 million, from $454.0 million a year ago.  Comparable sales, including the e-commerce channel, for the second quarter decreased 13% compared to the corresponding 13-week period ended August 3, 2013.  
The Company now expects its second quarter operating loss to be in the range of approximately $61.0 to $64.0 million.  This translates to a net loss in the range of $0.80 to $0.83 per diluted share, which includes net charges totaling approximately $29.0 to $31.0 million or $0.37 to $0.39 per share (of which approximately $5 million relates to non-operating items), that were not previously reflected in the Company's original second quarter guidance.  The total charge includes asset impairment charges, a charge against net deferred tax assets, consulting fees for operational initiatives, consulting fees associated with our cost reduction plan, investment banking fees, and interest and fee expense related to the Company's transaction with Sycamore Partners.  
Excluding the charges, the Company expects its second quarter operating loss to be in the range of $36.0 to $38.0 million, or $0.42 to $0.45 per diluted share.  This compares to the Company's original guidance of operating losses in the range of $49.0 to $54.0 million, or a net loss in the range of $0.55 to $0.61.  
The Company expects to announce second quarter earnings on Thursday, August 21, 2014 at 4:15 PM (EDT).

Can Julian Geiger Pick Up the Crumbs at Aeropostale?









Laurie Kulikowski




Aug 19, 2014 11:37 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Aeropostale's (ARO) ability to regain momentum following three years of negative comparable sales will be difficult, even with former CEO Julian Geiger leading the charge. Shares of the teen retailer were surging on Tuesday by 21% to $3.91 following its decision to bring back Geiger to replace Thomas Johnson as CEO as well as its disclosure that second-quarter losses would be narrower than expected. But the retail industry overall has rapidly changed in the past few years, particularly so for the mall-based teen sector, leaving a tall order for Geiger to get the company up to speed. "While Geiger's knowledge of Aero is unmatched, we expected a CEO replacement to provide a fresh look at the business given the changing teen landscape," Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Lorraine Hutchinson wrote in a research note. Hutchinson maintained her "underperform" rating for the stock.  Read More: Aeropostale Struggling to Show it Can Still Be Cool Like Forever 21, H&M Geiger was CEO of Aeropostale from 1996-2010 and chairman from 1998-2012, where he led the company through a successful run as teens flocked to malls in search of logo-specific and homogenous clothing. Geiger left Aeropostale to run Crumbs Bake Shop from late 2011 to December 2013. But last month Crumbs closed all of its stores and is in the process of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite Aeropostale's effort to reinvent itself by offering a wider assortment of fashion brands and new categories like footwear, a rebranding effort under the Aero Now campaign, and the consideration of closing up to 16% of its store base, reinstating a CEO that just came off of a failed business seems questionable.
