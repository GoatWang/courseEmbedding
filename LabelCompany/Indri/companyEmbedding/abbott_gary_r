 Educational Background



Bachelor of Science, Engineering 
Class of 1994 


Colorado School of Mines

                  Colorado School of Mines is a public research university devoted to engineering and applied science. It has the highest admissions standards of any public university in Colorado and among the highest of any public university in the U.S.

Mines has distinguished itself by developing a curriculum and research program geared towards responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources. In addition to strong education and research programs in traditional fields of science and engineering, Mines is one of a very few institutions in the world having broad expertise in resource exploration, extraction, production and utilization. As such, Mines occupies a unique position among the world's institutions of higher education.

Since its founding in 1874, the translation of the school's mission into educational programs has been influenced by the needs of society. Those needs are now focused more clearly than ever before. The world faces a crisis in balancing resource availability with environmental protection and Mines and its programs are central to the solution.

Mines offers all the advantages of a world-class research institution with a size that allows for personal attention.                





 Career History



Vice President, Corporate Engineering

                                    2002 - Current                


Cimarex Energy Co.


                  Cimarex Energy, Co. (NYSE, XEC) is a Denver-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with principal operations in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin areas of the U.S. Our business approach is centered on increasing shareholder value through consistent profitable growth in proved reserves and production through our drilling program and optimizing production rates. Year-end 2011 proved reserves totaled 2.05 trillion cubic feet equivalent (59% natural gas and 82% developed).

Our approach is focused on drill-bit driven growth in production and reserves utilizing risked rate of return economics to evaluate projects. We rely heavily on our organization of geoscientists to generate our drilling prospects. We have decentralized exploration teams who are experts in their regions. A cornerstone to our approach is detailed evaluation of each drilling decision based on its risk-adjusted discounted cash flow rate of return on investment. Our analysis includes estimates and assessments of potential reserve size, geologic and mechanical risks, expected costs and future production profiles.

We also believe it is important to maintain a strong financial position and conservative capital structure in order to maintain drilling activity through all price cycles. We believe that this approach will create shareholder value through growth in per-share earnings, cash flow, reserves and production

                                    1999 - 2002

I was house sitting for my neighbor and when I went to put their mail in the house there was no heat and it was 12 degrees outside. I called AMS and he was there in 30 minutes on a Sunday night. He had the part needed, charged them total of 60.00 and said he would wait for payment until they came home, no problem. Great service, friendly nice guy who really wiped his feet at the door before walking on the carpeting, that was nice to see! Yes, I will continue to recommend him and will call again when I need heating or air cond. service.

Gary R Abbott



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Ohio Professional:













Does Abbott Mechanical Services carry a valid contracting license?



Ohio does not require contractors to be licensed to perform residential construction. However, Ohio does require a contractor to be licensed for commercial construction. 
Abbott Mechanical Services currently holds license RE.46277, HY.46277, HV.46277, HV-0000046277, HY-0000046277, RE-0000046277, OHHV-0000046277 (Refrigeration Contractor, Hydronics Contractor, Hvac Contractor, Hvac, Hydronics, Refrigeration), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Ohio Professional?



Commercial contractors must pass a trade exam and prove continuous trade experience in order to become licensed in Ohio. Continuing education is required to renew all commercial contracting licenses. 











Your liability risk when hiring Abbott Mechanical Services



Commercial contractors are required to carry a general liability insurance policy. Although there is no requirement for residential construction, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with both general liability and workers' compensation insurance. Request a current insurance certificate for both general liability and workers' compensation before any works starts. 











What else should I know before hiring Abbott Mechanical Services



Commercially licensed contractors in Ohio must provide tax records for the previous 5 years to be eligible for a license. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Ohio, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
