​Canyonlands National Park Tours with O.A.R.S.






























































































Canyonlands National Park Tours








Outdoor Adventures in Canyonlands National Park
There are places in Utah’s Canyonlands National Park, where as a visitor, you can see nearly 100 miles in any given direction. Imagine the panoramic canyon country views.
Established in 1964, Canyonlands National Park has more than 2,500 square miles of canyons, cliffs, hoodoos, and mesas around the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. The landscape consists of deep canyons, bright orange mesas, buff-colored pinnacles and maroon buttes—the colors of which intensify at sunrise and sunset.
 



 



 
Located just outside of Moab, Utah, Canyonlands is found within the geologic region of the Colorado Plateau. The park is essentially composed of five unique areas: the Island in the Sky District in the northern part; the Needles District in the southeastern portion; the Maze District, which is the least accessible district; Horseshoe Canyon, which contains some of the most significant rock art in North America; and the Colorado River and its tributaries, which are corridors providing relatively easy access to some of the park’s most remote backcountry areas.


 


Canyonlands National Park offers a variety of recreational activities including rafting, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, and camping. The most popular seasons to visit are spring (April through May) and fall (mid-September through October), when daytime highs average 60- to 80-degrees F and lows average 30- to 50-degrees F. However, this high-desert region can experience wide temperature fluctuations, sometimes over 40 F degrees in a single day.
 



 



 
Canyonlands National Park Vacations with O.A.R.S.
If you are considering a national park vacation this year but don’t have time to deal with all the necessary logistics, O.A.R.S. offers all-inclusive national park vacations in Canyonlands National Park. Visiting Canyonlands with O.A.R.S. may include multiple days rafting through the heart of the park on the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon, a short scenic interpretive backcountry tour, or a combination of several adventures.
Insider Tip: Cataract Canyon rafting in late spring often offers massive Class IV+ rapids. Snowmelt from the Rockies yields big runoff and some of the country’s most renowned whitewater. It’s Canyonlands National Park for the adrenaline junkie.
O.A.R.S. Canyonlands, Inc. is an authorized concessioner of Canyonlands National Park.

Hawaii’s vibe is casual and laid-back, but you’d be forgiven for trying to pack your trip with activities and tours. After all, life here is mostly lived outside—chowing down on traditional island food at a luau, surfing or bodyboarding the waves, snorkeling or diving the coral reefs, or hiking over ancient lava flows—and each main island offers both expected and unique experiences. Sail and snorkel off the coast of Maui, the island known for being the picture-perfect tropical idyll. Head to the Big Island to summit Mauna Kea at sunrise, hike along volcanic crater rims, and kayak with dolphins in Kealakekua Bay. Rugged Kauai is home to verdant rain forests and valleys that beg to be hiked and photographed. Oahu is a hotbed of multicultural activities in Honolulu and beyond: Immerse yourself in world history at Pearl Harbor, take a guided hike up Diamond Head, or learn to surf at Waikiki Beach.

Exhibit 4.9

THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL
INDENTURE

THIS THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE
(this “ Supplemental Indenture ”), dated as of
December 7, 2016, among the entities listed in Schedule I
hereto (each a “ Guaranteeing Subsidiary ” and
together, the “ Guaranteeing Subsidiaries ”),
each a subsidiary of Aramark Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the “ Issuer ”), and The Bank of New York
Mellon, as trustee (the “ Trustee ”).

W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, the Issuer has heretofore
executed and delivered to the Trustee an indenture (the “
Indenture ”), dated as of December 17, 2015, providing
for the issuance of an unlimited aggregate principal amount of
5.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “ Notes
”);

WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that
under certain circumstances each Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which such Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall
unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s Obligations
under the Notes and the Indenture on the terms and conditions set
forth herein and under the Indenture (the “ Guarantee
”); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of
the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to execute and deliver
this Supplemental Indenture.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties mutually
covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders
of the Notes as follows:

(1)    
Capitalized Terms . Capitalized terms used herein
without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.

(2)    
Agreement to Guarantee . Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary
hereby agrees as follows:

(a)    Along
with all other Guarantors, to jointly and severally unconditionally
guarantee to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by
the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns,
irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture,
the Notes or the obligations of the Issuer hereunder or thereunder,
that:

(i)    the
principal of, interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any,
on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on
the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if
lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuer to the Holders or
the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full
or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof;
and

(ii)    in case
of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or of
any such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full
when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension
or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so
guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason,
the Guarantors and the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall be jointly
and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. This is a
guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.



(b)    The
obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the
validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the
Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any
provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against
the Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a guarantor.

(c)    The
following is hereby waived: diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding
first against the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands
whatsoever.

(d)    This
Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of
the obligations contained in the Notes, the Indenture and this
Supplemental Indenture, and each Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts
all obligations of a Guarantor under the Indenture.

(e)    If any
Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to the Issuer, the Guarantors (including the Guaranteeing
Subsidiaries), or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other
similar official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the
Guarantors, any amount paid either to the Trustee or such Holder,
this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

(f)    Each
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any
obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all
obligations guaranteed hereby.

(g)    As
between the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the
obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in
Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of this Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations
guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of
acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of the
Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries
for the purpose of this Guarantee.

(h)    Each
Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall have the right to seek contribution
from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right
does not impair the rights of the Holders under this
Guarantee.

(i)    Pursuant
to Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to all other
contingent and fixed liabilities that are relevant under any
applicable Bankruptcy or fraudulent conveyance laws, and after
giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive
contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other
Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor
under Article 10 of the Indenture, this new Guarantee shall be
limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations
of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary under this Guarantee will not
constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(j)    This
Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be
effective should any petition be filed by or against the Issuer for
liquidation, reorganization, should the Issuer become insolvent or
make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a
receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of
the Issuer’s assets, and shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any

time payment and performance of the
Notes are, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in
amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on
the Notes and Guarantee, whether as a “voidable
preference,” “fraudulent transfer” or otherwise,
all as though such payment or performance had not been
made. In the event that any payment or any part thereof, is
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Note shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced
only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or
returned.

(k)    In case
any provision of this Guarantee shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

(l)    This
Guarantee shall be a general unsecured senior obligation of such
Guaranteeing Subsidiary, ranking pari passu with any other
future Senior Indebtedness of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary, if
any.

Enjoyed this hotel quite a bit. The building was like new, the rooms were large, and all was nice and clean. Can't go wrong with that! There was a decent breakfast as part of the room cost. Wi-fi was free too. Very nice facility.


Room Tip: It was quiet everywhere while we were there out of season but the back would have a view of the rock...

“Very Good Hotel In the Heart of Moab”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was the best run hotel of this caliber we have been in for a long time. The management was helpful and prompt. This inn is in downtown and in walking distance of many local restaurants as well as a national chain burger joint. We came as part of a tour. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. Our room contained two vanities. Wi-Fi was fast, reliable and free. Breakfast was the usual buffet for this size inn and was better than average. All in all this was a good stay. Laundry facilities were available which is helpful for tour groups.

“Great location & facilities - plus excellent wheelchair access”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was an impromptu stay and they sorted out a wonderfully accessible room with a roll in shower and lots of space! You do need to mention if you need some kind of access as a lot of the rooms are up / down 2 or 3 steps so it helps them to allocate a decent room for you if they know steps are problematic. The welcome at reception was just lovely and with free cookies and ice water / lemon water plus fantastic hospitality - and free wifi, parking and breakfast - you can't go wrong here. We also enjoyed the laundry downstairs and if you have time to enjoy the pool, it has an access lift for those who need it.

“Really good hotel, excellent location”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our two week roadtrip in Nevada, Arizona and Utah. The room was really good with two queen size beads and one sofa bed. We were four persons and had plenty of room. We really appreciated the bendable lights, two by each bed, making it possible for us to read in bed.The hotel is convinently situated close to plenty of restaurants, and close to The Arches, making it possible to get there early in the morning.The breakfast was good, and most importantly for us it included fresh fruit and yoghurt. The hotel has a lovely pool to use after hiking, and although small it was never crowded.The only setback was that we had our room close to where the breakfast was and the elevator. Whenever people were talking outside the room it was like they were in our room. The people in the room next to us were having very loud fights, and we could hear them yelling and speaking loudly.


Room Tip: Not close to the elevator, lots of people walking by.

“Shocking it's a Best Western but with luxury”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



I tend to stay in nice boutique hotels but was booked at this Best Western as part of a package deal with a Sheri Griffith rafting trip (which was awesome). The hotel is located in a great part of town convenient to shopping and the best restaurants. The staff were friendly and professional, making my check-in and check-out smooth and quick. The best part of this hotel has to be the rooms, they are huge, clean and updated. I never would have expected such a great room from Best Western. While the staff are friendly, their restaurant recommendations appeared to be based on contacts versus actual quality. Look at Trip Advisor or other sources to find some great places to eat. Also, the breakfast was pretty low quality and just didn't match the rest of the quality of the rooms, so maybe look at a local café for breakfast if you want something nicer. But overall this hotel was a pleasant surprise and easy to recommend to others. If I'm ever in Moab again, I would hesitate to stay here again.

“Disappointing Stay”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



Stayed here on the last leg of our national parks tour of Utah. Having come from two other similarly priced hotels in other areas (and different chains) we were highly disappointed in the quality of his hotel for the price we paid. Lots of small inconveniences and missed opportunities in service led to a frustrating experience that we were glad to leave after two nights. Though the location is great in the heart of Moab it isn't worth the price. Don't be deceived by the photos- rooms and amenities are not as expansive as they appear.

“WONDERFUL HOTEL”


Reviewed 5 days ago
NEW 



We stayed two nights and enjoyed the large room. The two bendable and strong reading lights on each side of both beds were perfect for easy reading. The two sinks in the two-room bathroom area great for a couple both wanting to get ready at the same time. WiFi and TV worked well. Wonderful and reasonably priced guest laundry room were a godsend. We enjoyed the free cookies and lemon water in the lobby as well as free newspapers. The staff was so helpful and very knowledgable of the area. We will stay there on on next visit for sure. They know how to do hotel rooms! Very guest friendly!!


Room Tip: Our room bordered the parking lot, but we never heard any noise.

“Very Good Hotel In the Heart of Moab”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was the best run hotel of this caliber we have been in for a long time. The management was helpful and prompt. This inn is in downtown and in walking distance of many local restaurants as well as a national chain burger joint. We came as part of a tour. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. Our room contained two vanities. Wi-Fi was fast, reliable and free. Breakfast was the usual buffet for this size inn and was better than average. All in all this was a good stay. Laundry facilities were available which is helpful for tour groups.

“Great location & facilities - plus excellent wheelchair access”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was an impromptu stay and they sorted out a wonderfully accessible room with a roll in shower and lots of space! You do need to mention if you need some kind of access as a lot of the rooms are up / down 2 or 3 steps so it helps them to allocate a decent room for you if they know steps are problematic. The welcome at reception was just lovely and with free cookies and ice water / lemon water plus fantastic hospitality - and free wifi, parking and breakfast - you can't go wrong here. We also enjoyed the laundry downstairs and if you have time to enjoy the pool, it has an access lift for those who need it.

“Really good hotel, excellent location”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 



This was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our two week roadtrip in Nevada, Arizona and Utah. The room was really good with two queen size beads and one sofa bed. We were four persons and had plenty of room. We really appreciated the bendable lights, two by each bed, making it possible for us to read in bed.The hotel is convinently situated close to plenty of restaurants, and close to The Arches, making it possible to get there early in the morning.The breakfast was good, and most importantly for us it included fresh fruit and yoghurt. The hotel has a lovely pool to use after hiking, and although small it was never crowded.The only setback was that we had our room close to where the breakfast was and the elevator. Whenever people were talking outside the room it was like they were in our room. The people in the room next to us were having very loud fights, and we could hear them yelling and speaking loudly.


Room Tip: Not close to the elevator, lots of people walking by.

“Shocking it's a Best Western but with luxury”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



I tend to stay in nice boutique hotels but was booked at this Best Western as part of a package deal with a Sheri Griffith rafting trip (which was awesome). The hotel is located in a great part of town convenient to shopping and the best restaurants. The staff were friendly and professional, making my check-in and check-out smooth and quick. The best part of this hotel has to be the rooms, they are huge, clean and updated. I never would have expected such a great room from Best Western. While the staff are friendly, their restaurant recommendations appeared to be based on contacts versus actual quality. Look at Trip Advisor or other sources to find some great places to eat. Also, the breakfast was pretty low quality and just didn't match the rest of the quality of the rooms, so maybe look at a local café for breakfast if you want something nicer. But overall this hotel was a pleasant surprise and easy to recommend to others. If I'm ever in Moab again, I would hesitate to stay here again.

Having come from two other similarly priced hotels in other areas (and different chains) we were highly disappointed in the quality of his hotel for the price we paid. Lots of small inconveniences and missed opportunities in service led to a frustrating experience that we were glad to leave after two nights. Though the location is great in the heart of Moab it isn't worth the price. Don't be deceived by the photos- rooms and amenities are not as expansive as they appear.

​Canyonlands National Park Tours with O.A.R.S.






























































































Canyonlands National Park Tours








Outdoor Adventures in Canyonlands National Park
There are places in Utah’s Canyonlands National Park, where as a visitor, you can see nearly 100 miles in any given direction. Imagine the panoramic canyon country views.
Established in 1964, Canyonlands National Park has more than 2,500 square miles of canyons, cliffs, hoodoos, and mesas around the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. The landscape consists of deep canyons, bright orange mesas, buff-colored pinnacles and maroon buttes—the colors of which intensify at sunrise and sunset.
 



 



 
Located just outside of Moab, Utah, Canyonlands is found within the geologic region of the Colorado Plateau. The park is essentially composed of five unique areas: the Island in the Sky District in the northern part; the Needles District in the southeastern portion; the Maze District, which is the least accessible district; Horseshoe Canyon, which contains some of the most significant rock art in North America; and the Colorado River and its tributaries, which are corridors providing relatively easy access to some of the park’s most remote backcountry areas.


 


Canyonlands National Park offers a variety of recreational activities including rafting, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, and camping. The most popular seasons to visit are spring (April through May) and fall (mid-September through October), when daytime highs average 60- to 80-degrees F and lows average 30- to 50-degrees F. However, this high-desert region can experience wide temperature fluctuations, sometimes over 40 F degrees in a single day.
 



 



 
Canyonlands National Park Vacations with O.A.R.S.
If you are considering a national park vacation this year but don’t have time to deal with all the necessary logistics, O.A.R.S. offers all-inclusive national park vacations in Canyonlands National Park. Visiting Canyonlands with O.A.R.S. may include multiple days rafting through the heart of the park on the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon, a short scenic interpretive backcountry tour, or a combination of several adventures.
Insider Tip: Cataract Canyon rafting in late spring often offers massive Class IV+ rapids. Snowmelt from the Rockies yields big runoff and some of the country’s most renowned whitewater. It’s Canyonlands National Park for the adrenaline junkie.
O.A.R.S. Canyonlands, Inc. is an authorized concessioner of Canyonlands National Park.

Hawaii’s vibe is casual and laid-back, but you’d be forgiven for trying to pack your trip with activities and tours. After all, life here is mostly lived outside—chowing down on traditional island food at a luau, surfing or bodyboarding the waves, snorkeling or diving the coral reefs, or hiking over ancient lava flows—and each main island offers both expected and unique experiences. Sail and snorkel off the coast of Maui, the island known for being the picture-perfect tropical idyll. Head to the Big Island to summit Mauna Kea at sunrise, hike along volcanic crater rims, and kayak with dolphins in Kealakekua Bay. Rugged Kauai is home to verdant rain forests and valleys that beg to be hiked and photographed. Oahu is a hotbed of multicultural activities in Honolulu and beyond: Immerse yourself in world history at Pearl Harbor, take a guided hike up Diamond Head, or learn to surf at Waikiki Beach. Molokai and Lanai, the two least populated of the main islands, beckon travelers who want seclusion, empty beaches, and authentic Hawaiian culture. Whatever your vision of a dream Hawaiian vacation, the recipe is simple: Choose your islands, choose your activities, choose your pace, book your trip, and enjoy.
