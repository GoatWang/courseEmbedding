4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Carl Baker Jr., born December 14, 1926. Passed away July 20, 2009 at the age of 82. He was a long time resident of Longview and a member of Wesley Methodist Church; where he taught Sunday school for many years. Mr. Baker and his brother Rogers (Deceased) started and owned Gas Engine and Compressor Service, a local small business, from 1962 until present. Later in life, Carl reconnected with Julia Ann Montgomery, a hometown friend from his younger days in Bradley, AR. They shared a special friendship until this day. He is preceded in death by his wife Helen Baker, his brother Rogers Baker, his parents Carl and Ruth Baker. He is survived by his sister and brother in law, Martha and Dale Massey of Granbury Texas, his four children; daughter Karen Hailey (of Hot Springs, Ar.), daughter Ann Lee (of Tallahassee, FL), son Don Baker (of Conway, AR), son David Baker (of Longview, TX), sister-in-law, Betty Baker and four nieces. He had eight grandchildren; Daniel Baker of Chattanooga, TN, Amanda Baker of Austin, TX, Troy Lee of Tallahassee, FL, Hubert Lee of Conway, AR, Jeremy, Nick, and Natalie Baker of Longview, TX, and Carl Waddill of Houston, TX. And one great-grand child, Keira Baker of Longview, TX. Carl grew up in Bradley, AR. At age 17, he joined the Navy and served his country during WWII. He went on to earn his Bachelors in Business Administration form the University of Arkansas in 1949, where he was also a member of the Sigma Pi Fraternity. Carl was an entrepreneur at heart and he loved his business. He was an innovator and pioneer in his field and was recognized as such by the Oil & Gas Journal in 1966. He had a lifelong passion for flight and when he stopped flying airplanes, this passion led him to bird watching and sailing. He is dearly missed. Special thanks to Dr. Rangu and staff, the staff at Westminster Buckner, the staff at Longview Behaviorial Hospital, the staff at Southwood Nursing Home, the staff at Whispering Pines Nursing Home, Kilgore Allegiance Behavioral, the staff at Odyssey Hospice, and the staff at ETMC Henderson. Funeral services will be Noon Friday, July 24, in the Chapel of Rader Funeral Home with Reverend Jerry Turner and Reverend Don Baker officiating. Entombment will follow in Lakeview Mausoleum. The family will greet friends at the funeral home on Friday from 10 AM to Noon. Pall bearers will be Jay Baker, Nick Baker, Carl Waddill, Daniel Baker, Bud Crabtree and Dale Massey. "I am the captain of my ship I am the master of my soul."

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







Stopped on the way to Vegas and it was empty. One kid running the show. He handled it well food came out normal amount of time and was hot. Tasted like Carl's JR. Stopped on the way home too, same kid working (he had others this time helping) but some want to be scary guy with last weeks food stuck in he's rancid beard was yelling at the poor kid over a breakfast burrito. Poor kid looked like he had been through this song and dance before. I know people are heading home from a long weekend, hung over, broke, or what ever... But it's food people. They are doing their best. This kid did better than that. He even put up with me talking to someone while ordering. The food came out wrong because of ME! I could complain but why? There needs to be more positivity. We went to Carl's Jr. We got Carl's Jr. The staff did their job, the place was clean, what more do you need!







Clean lobby & bathrooms, nice and very polite staff and good on the road food. We ate there as a family after driving from Disneyland and the food came out quick and hot. I would stop here over any other place in town.







This Carl's Jr was spotless!  I was very impressed to see if the employees weren't helping with a customer they were cleaning. All the employees were very nice and knowledgeable of the menu.







Carl's Jr. Is located near the intersection of highway 15 and route 127.  Highway 15 is a major thoroughfare that takes you from Barstow to Lost Wages.  Route 127 is a less-traveled backroads highway that takes you to the southern and eastern entrances of Death Valley National Park.  I have visited Death Valley National Park on six different weekends, in the years 2013-2014, and found Carl's Jr. to be a welcome pit stop after a long day of hiking and photography.   I always order the Carl's Jr. Santa Fe chicken sandwich, and typically I always pay extra for additional roasted green chiles.  Because of the energy-draining quality of hiking and doing photography for eight straight hours, and because of their delicious nature, I sometimes order TWO Santa Fe chicken sandwiches.  Mmmm, I do like them. 

Carl's Jr. In Baker, CA is clean, and has polite and service-oriented cashiers.  I am also glad that Carl's Jr. In Baker, CA has good cell phone reception, since I like to call my better half after completing my long day of exploring and hiking.  After my weekend desert photography weekends, I have also gone to Carl's Jr. in Ridgecrest, CA and in Joshua Tree, CA, and always order Santa Fe chicken, with extra roasted green chiles.  

THE MAD GREEK.  An alternative to Carl's Jr. in Baker, CA is The Mad Greek.  The Mad Greek is also located at the same intersection of Route 15 and Route 127, but I think that one visit to The Mad Greek is enough.   The Mad Greek is distinguished by its amusing tacky decor (plenty of faux Greek statues), but the cuisine is not perfect (the dolmas are soggy).  And so, I tend to opt for Carl's Jr. when returning home from Death Valley, but once I stopped in Barstow at a Subway restaurant.

CARL'S JR. COFFEE.   Also, the coffee at Carl's Jr. is good.  The coffee is MUCH BETTER than that from Starbucks (blech, yech, ewww) but not as good as the coffee from Peet's.  Good coffee is important, because it takes me six hours of driving at night to return home, and generally I'm on the road until nearly midnight after my long days in the desert.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.







We went there today and a WONDERFUL NICE girl made it nice. Now we just had drive they but she was SO SO nice. She had beautiful eyelashes and tattoos. Very nice place to stop. Food was fresh. Service was perfect.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







We moved to Vegas 3 years ago and we stopped in baker very often and everything had a "baker taste" we have not stopped in over 2 years but today the freeway was at a standstill and found the fast food place with as many stars as possible and we were surprised. when I say 5 stars it is 5 stars for Baker







I have said it before and I will say it again. I love Carl's JR burgers. I know most people prefer an InNOut but Carl's JR is where I go when I want a burger quick and conveniently. Still, I would not normally give them a 5 star review.

This location is in Baker, we were here around sunset and it was eerily quiet and lots of crows. Spooky even.

The reasons this one gets a 5 star review? The staff were friendly, the place was clean, the food was cooked perfectly, the burgers didnt fall apart and when I went to throw out my cup they reminded me that I could get a refill to go. 

They certainly went above and beyond expectations...!







4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







What can i say, its a Carls Jr.....however, it was very clean...restrooms included...i accidentally walked into the men's restroom. The greeting we received from employee, Noe was great. He was definitely happy to be there and working. He was funny, friendly and welcoming. My breakfast biscuit was tasty and the coffee was fresh, what else can you ask for. 

The Baker Carl's Jr get 2 thumbs up!!







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Tractor trailer parking /clean restrooms / fresh food. Always ask for a fresh bun for your sandwich. The sesame buns don't cut it.  10% off for truckers big deal.  Bring your coupons to make it count.







I don't know if it was the fact that I had driven for 200 miles prior to this Carl's Jr. or if they really are above the average Jr. but the Famous Star with Cheese I had was delicious. I doubt I'll become a regular though with it being about 100 miles from home.







How can you hate on Carl's? It's the best fast food joint. Stand outside and smell charbroiled burgers cookin and you'll be like "damn!" This is a new location so it's still clean and the bathrooms haven't been tagged up yet.







Clean place and very quick service. Ordered and served in 25 seconds. Chicken strips with BBQ sauce was great!







Friendly service, greeted upon entry. Food brought to table after ordering at counter & they brought ketchup and ranch without even being asked...sweet.







We stopped by this Carl's Jr. on a recent road trip. My boy wanted the chicken stars, so in we went.

We were greeted right away by the guy behind the counter, even as he was helping another customer. 

Our first stop was to the restroom to wash hands and we found it to be well kept and well stocked.

The same guy who greeted us took our order. He was very polite. I so want to give him props, but I never got around to reading the name on his badge.

Overall... Food is typical. We ordered a kids meal and a salad. I'm so glad they didn't mess it up. Place is well kept. It wasn't busy when we were there, and it was pretty quiet inside with country music playing in the background. 

Before we left, Nice Dude took our tray and trash from the table. He even checked up on us during our meal. 

Anyway... Our visit there was on Thursday, March 1, 2012 around 11am. The guy working there was super nice, really attentive, and made for a pleasant visit. I'm adding a star because of him.

Carl's Jr. Is located near the intersection of highway 15 and route 127.  Highway 15 is a major thoroughfare that takes you from Barstow to Lost Wages.  Route 127 is a less-traveled backroads highway that takes you to the southern and eastern entrances of Death Valley National Park.  I have visited Death Valley National Park on six different weekends, in the years 2013-2014, and found Carl's Jr. to be a welcome pit stop after a long day of hiking and photography.   I always order the Carl's Jr. Santa Fe chicken sandwich, and typically I always pay extra for additional roasted green chiles.  Because of the energy-draining quality of hiking and doing photography for eight straight hours, and because of their delicious nature, I sometimes order TWO Santa Fe chicken sandwiches.  Mmmm, I do like them. Carl's Jr. In Baker, CA is clean, and has polite and service-oriented cashiers.  I am also glad that Carl's Jr. In Baker, CA has good cell phone reception, since I like to call my better half after completing my long day of exploring and hiking.  After my weekend desert photography weekends, I have also gone to Carl's Jr. in Ridgecrest, CA and in Joshua Tree, CA, and always order Santa Fe chicken, with extra roasted green chiles.  THE MAD GREEK.  An alternative to Carl's Jr. in Baker, CA is The Mad Greek.  The Mad Greek is also located at the same intersection of Route 15 and Route 127, but I think that one visit to The Mad Greek is enough.   The Mad Greek is distinguished by its amusing tacky decor (plenty of faux Greek statues), but the cuisine is not perfect (the dolmas are soggy).  And so, I tend to opt for Carl's Jr. when returning home from Death Valley, but once I stopped in Barstow at a Subway restaurant.CARL'S JR. COFFEE.   Also, the coffee at Carl's Jr. is good.  The coffee is MUCH BETTER than that from Starbucks (blech, yech, ewww) but not as good as the coffee from Peet's.  Good coffee is important, because it takes me six hours of driving at night to return home, and generally I'm on the road until nearly midnight after my long days in the desert.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

We moved to Vegas 3 years ago and we stopped in baker very often and everything had a "baker taste" we have not stopped in over 2 years but today the freeway was at a standstill and found the fast food place with as many stars as possible and we were surprised. when I say 5 stars it is 5 stars for Baker

I have said it before and I will say it again. I love Carl's JR burgers. I know most people prefer an InNOut but Carl's JR is where I go when I want a burger quick and conveniently. Still, I would not normally give them a 5 star review.This location is in Baker, we were here around sunset and it was eerily quiet and lots of crows. Spooky even.The reasons this one gets a 5 star review? The staff were friendly, the place was clean, the food was cooked perfectly, the burgers didnt fall apart and when I went to throw out my cup they reminded me that I could get a refill to go. They certainly went above and beyond expectations...!

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

What can i say, its a Carls Jr.....however, it was very clean...restrooms included...i accidentally walked into the men's restroom. The greeting we received from employee, Noe was great. He was definitely happy to be there and working. He was funny, friendly and welcoming. My breakfast biscuit was tasty and the coffee was fresh, what else can you ask for. The Baker Carl's Jr get 2 thumbs up!!

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Tractor trailer parking /clean restrooms / fresh food. Always ask for a fresh bun for your sandwich. The sesame buns don't cut it.  10% off for truckers big deal.  Bring your coupons to make it count.

I don't know if it was the fact that I had driven for 200 miles prior to this Carl's Jr. or if they really are above the average Jr. but the Famous Star with Cheese I had was delicious. I doubt I'll become a regular though with it being about 100 miles from home.

How can you hate on Carl's? It's the best fast food joint. Stand outside and smell charbroiled burgers cookin and you'll be like "damn!" This is a new location so it's still clean and the bathrooms haven't been tagged up yet.

We stopped by this Carl's Jr. on a recent road trip. My boy wanted the chicken stars, so in we went.We were greeted right away by the guy behind the counter, even as he was helping another customer. Our first stop was to the restroom to wash hands and we found it to be well kept and well stocked.The same guy who greeted us took our order. He was very polite. I so want to give him props, but I never got around to reading the name on his badge.Overall... Food is typical. We ordered a kids meal and a salad. I'm so glad they didn't mess it up. Place is well kept. It wasn't busy when we were there, and it was pretty quiet inside with country music playing in the background. Before we left, Nice Dude took our tray and trash from the table. He even checked up on us during our meal. Anyway... Our visit there was on Thursday, March 1, 2012 around 11am. The guy working there was super nice, really attentive, and made for a pleasant visit. I'm adding a star because of him.

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







God awful service for a FAST food restaurant. We waited 20 minutes in the drive thru with only one other car ahead of us. What gives?







This is the wost experience ever!    Empty resturant, dirty, and took forever to get our food.







Slowest "fast" food ever.  I had time enough to get pissed, download this app and write this comment and I still haven't gotten food, they served 2 customers in 12 minutes and I am still second in line.  I understand fresh but I could have sat down at a real restaurant and gotten my food by now.







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Bought a large ($2.49) ice tea. They were out and refused to make another batch. I asked for my money back and the manager refused. I asked then could I just buy a glass for water. Again no, plus "I'm sorry". I don't think English was this person's first language and since it was slow I don't think customer service was either when I said I'm not drinking carbonated or sweetened beverages. Eventually another batch of unsweetened tea was made. 20 minutes of drive time lost too. Disappointed







Doesn't even deserve the single star.
In one visit, this happened:
The place is dirty 
The soda machine is empty 
The iced tea is empty 
The coffee is bad 
Service is slow
Burger is soaked in mustard
The shake was horribly made
And much much more

Everything went wrong in a single visit







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







Coming back from a Vegas trip we do our usual stop in Baker. As we walk in we are "greeted" by 3 large bags of trash left by the doorway. Then when trying to take an order the staff was busy goofing off and not really paying attention.







Well this is just your average Carl's Jr.  It looked ok and had the same quality that you expect from other Carl's Jr stores.  The burgers we ordered were yummy and the fries were fresh.  

The reason I gave this location 2 stars is because of the women's restroom.  This may sound bad, but Baker, CA is a pit stop for almost everyone that passes through it for restroom breaks between Las Vegas and LA.  Every place in this town should have a clean restroom.  Well this fact was missed on this Carl's Jr.  The women's restroom smelled of urine (now that gets my appetite going!), had messy stalls, and a pile of dirty diapers next to the changing table.  If the bathroom was clean, I definitely would have given this place a solid 3 maybe a 4 star rating.







First time coing to Carl's being from the east coast they don't have any. Well I was impressed they serve burgers even in the morning. Well it's okay nothing fancy but was decent.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

Slowest "fast" food ever.  I had time enough to get pissed, download this app and write this comment and I still haven't gotten food, they served 2 customers in 12 minutes and I am still second in line.  I understand fresh but I could have sat down at a real restaurant and gotten my food by now.

Bought a large ($2.49) ice tea. They were out and refused to make another batch. I asked for my money back and the manager refused. I asked then could I just buy a glass for water. Again no, plus "I'm sorry". I don't think English was this person's first language and since it was slow I don't think customer service was either when I said I'm not drinking carbonated or sweetened beverages. Eventually another batch of unsweetened tea was made. 20 minutes of drive time lost too. Disappointed

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

Coming back from a Vegas trip we do our usual stop in Baker. As we walk in we are "greeted" by 3 large bags of trash left by the doorway. Then when trying to take an order the staff was busy goofing off and not really paying attention.

Well this is just your average Carl's Jr.  It looked ok and had the same quality that you expect from other Carl's Jr stores.  The burgers we ordered were yummy and the fries were fresh.  The reason I gave this location 2 stars is because of the women's restroom.  This may sound bad, but Baker, CA is a pit stop for almost everyone that passes through it for restroom breaks between Las Vegas and LA.  Every place in this town should have a clean restroom.  Well this fact was missed on this Carl's Jr.  The women's restroom smelled of urine (now that gets my appetite going!), had messy stalls, and a pile of dirty diapers next to the changing table.  If the bathroom was clean, I definitely would have given this place a solid 3 maybe a 4 star rating.

National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

4 for $4 real deal here. Great deal. Big hamburger  $1.99. Not great, not bad. Food was good, service was fast, lobby was clean.







Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. 

They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.







I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.

Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.

The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!







On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.







National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.







Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. 
BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  
Absolutely ridiculous!







The food was good, same as any other Carl's Jr. The restaurant was clean but the bathroom needed some attention.  It was late in the day, however.







On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  

After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  

They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  

Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).

Xie Xie!







Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.







They're super nice here! We ordered a turkey burger without mayo and the manager came back to suggest a sauce, in case it wasn't juicy enough without it! Thank you.







This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(

Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!







Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!

Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.

Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.

Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.







Visited on 26 July 2015, 1640.  Since its out of the way from the main road not too much foot traffic. Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.







What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.

Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.







TERRIBLE location!!!! I can get by without coke. Maybe the manager forgot to order the syrup. However, after waiting in a long line at the drive thru. They tell me that they were out of fish as well. I was like ok it's Monday I understand. I'll just have zucchinis with ranch. Sorry sir! "We're out of ranch" well, what do you want me to dip my zucchinis in? We have BBQ and sweet and sour?  I asked him, have u dipped zucchinis in BBQ sauce. No sir! Well WTF!!!! Just over wall terrible experience. Especially when you cal rave for something and you're salivation for that taste. Just wanted to share that incase you pass thru baker.







This place is dirty.   Coffee and fountain area was dirty.  All the bins for the coffee empty and dirty.  Used the women's room and this was dirty as well.  The wash basin has a grey look to it.  The stalls have not been cleaned areas overflowing.







If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed







What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..







Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. 

We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. 

This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. 

I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.







I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.

Slow af, my girl ordered chicken tenders and got jalapeño poppers. When we went back inside to exchange them for the chicken tenders the guy took the jalapeño poppers put them back on the heating rack and gave her, her burnt chicken tenders. They took 10 minutes when I was the only one at the restaurant. I would not eat here again.

I usually look forward to Carl's Jr. on trips. This one was a major disappointment.Bad lettuce, cheese not melted on burgers, tater tots in breakfast burger not cooked fully.The meal tastes like a poor imitation. Luckily the fries were still good!

On our way home from visiting friends in Vegas we stopped to get lunch in Baker. We sat in the drive thru wedged in between two cars for 30 minutes. No one took our order (the speaker must have been broke) and finally the cars behind us backed out. We followed. Do not recommend.

National franchise. Clean store. Food was as expected. Server was extremely friendly and efficient. Self-serve soda machines were out of order, but I expect that they are getting them fixed. Not really much more to review.

Ignore the 1 star rating, I give this place 0 stars! 0 STARS! This place is horrible! Horrible customer service, horrible food! Rudest employees. BEWARE THE DRIVE THRU! I am not exaggerating, we waited in the drive thru for 50mins! Once we got to the ordering speaker the first thing the employee says to us is "Can you give us a couple of minutes?!"  Absolutely ridiculous!

On the way home from Vegas, we stopped at Baker to get lunch to eat in the car.  The location was busy.  There were about 5 people ahead of us in line (one cashier), however, the line moved fairly fast.  After ordering, we got our food in about 12 minutes.  It was enough time for a bathroom break and a few sips of the fountain soda, then it was back on the road towards home.  They got my burger correct (only lettuce, tomato, and ketchup).  That doesn't always happen believe it or not!  Service was good at Carl's Jr.  I'll be back if we are in the area (to or from Vegas).Xie Xie!

Review for drive thru only.  Slowest drive thru ever.  Must be short staffed because they ask you to wait between each car as they assemble the prior order.  No comment as to food as I haven't received it yet but 10 minutes and 2 cars in drive thru lane is ridiculous when clearly it looks slow inside.  They should call it slow food.

This place is a mess tonight! Trash everywhere inside of the restaurant, AC must be down because it's hot inside the seating area...and no hand-soap or towels inside the restrooms...which might mean the employees aren't washing their hands when they use the facilities. Typically this place is better than this :-(Much better today...traveling back through and he place is perfect!!

Baker is fast food central.  Most the big guys are there.  The King, the Colonel, Jack, Subway, a Alien jerky operation, and some Greek guy with a mental disorder.  Where's the damn Clown?  No Clown!  I love the Clown and his Golden Arches!Then you got this place.  I had forgotten my contempt for Carl's Jr.  I was lured in by the Texas BBQ Thickburger propaganda.   False advertising!  I tried one today and it was horrible!  Took two bites and threw it in the trash.Then I bought a Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Swiss and Bacon.  Better than the Texas BBQ shit sandwich but not by much.  The salt level burned my taste buds. Thanks for the sodium.Never going to a Carl's Jr. again.

Jason, our cashier was professional and friendly.  Facility was not packed and clean during our visit. Minus the 106 degree weather nothing too much out of the ordinary to comment on.

What a sad turn of affairs that the amazing and iconic "Bun Boy" has been replaced by a Carl's Jr. burger. But I guess if it had to be any fast food burger to replace it - this would be a good one.Carl's Jr. offers some fairly good burgers - even at the mouth of the Mojave Desert. So if you are sick and tired of the Gyros at The Mad Greek - come here - for curly fries, a Big Carl, and a Shake.

If I could give it no stars I would. As I write this review I'm pissed because THEY ARE OPEN. At approximately 11:23pm (yes I looked at the clock) we pulled into the parking lot of a well lit Carl's Jr. We see the male employee inside scratching his hair . We pull around and stop to look at the menu then all of a sudden everything goes dark . My husband and I are like REALLY. We pull up to see the employee doing nothing so my husband waves him over and asked if they were closed. He says "hold on bro let me check. We might can get you in" He walks and asks someone else and come and says oh sorry yeah we're closed. When clearly Yelp said they were open. As much business as I do in Vegas I will never be a patron here. #fastfoodbully. Oh and I managed to get this typed BEFORE they closed

What was I thinking coming here? I can't rate the food because we saw how trashy dirty the place was and decided, if the staff can't maintain the tables, trash and soda area, imaging the food? Place was dirty beyond anything I've ever seen..

Fine dining in Baker is limited.. Baker is our typical stop on the way or the way back from Vegas. Carl's Jr is disappointing! Quality has gone down in decades especially at this location. We walked in to order coming back from Vegas.. Of course I ordered my nostalgic Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with fries and drink. The cashier said they were out of fries.. What the F! Still waiting for the stage coach to come to deliver fries. We were forced to order from the premium options which they were out of sweet potato fries and wedge cut potatoes also. I opted for the onion rings where were overcooked and disappointing. This location was semi clean. Not sure why it wasn't. There were barely any customers. I miss the charbroiled burgers which are non existent these days at Carl's Jr. If Cal was around, he'd be disappointed.

I have to say, this is a normal Carl's Junior; however. It's 11:00pm at night and we stopped with our two kids and the indoor dining was open and clean. It was really slow, but staff was busy cleaning. The food was fresh and warm. Typical Carl's junior. My stars are mostly because it was very clean, well decorated and staff was great to my kiddos. Our one year old needed to get out of the car. I wasn't terrified letting her walk around the restraunt. I got no dirty looks when she threw ice and fries on the freshly mopped floor.  Not many people show this kind of tolerance at a rest stop fast food place late at night. It was a welcomed surprise.
