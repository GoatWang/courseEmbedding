On the Road to Self-Discovery, Korean Jail Was a Pothole

By WILLIAM GRIMESMARCH 28, 2007

As a child on suburban Long Island, Cullen Thomas devoured Tintin comic books and the tales of Richard Francis Burton, the Victorian explorer. He thirsted for high adventure in foreign parts. At age 23, he got it: a sentence of three and a half years in South Korean prisons for mailing himself a kilogram of hashish.“Brother One Cell” is Mr. Thomas’s affecting account of his prison experience. It’s an offbeat coming-of-age story, the tale of a wide-eyed, innocent, middle-class American thrust into a world of deprivation and daily trials that speed his passage into adulthood and a deeper understanding of himself and the fallen creatures around him. Told simply, and with extraordinary good humor, it reads like a cross between “What I Did on My Summer Vacation” and “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.”Korea was an accident. At loose ends after college, Mr. Thomas joined a friend in Seoul who assured him that there was good money to be made teaching English. This turned out to be true, but Mr. Thomas quickly grew restless. During a vacation in the Philippines, he visited a remote village he had heard about, purchased a block of hashish and mailed it to a post office in Seoul. The police were waiting when he turned up to claim it.Mr. Thomas’s first inkling that he has made a serious mistake comes during his interrogation, when he is stimulated with a cattle prod, then tapped lightly on the skull with a nightstick, just enough to make the point. Mr. Shin, the unsmiling prosecuting attorney, assures him that he is in deep trouble, facing long years in prison. Mr. Shin is, in his own way, a kindly man, rather fascinated by Mr. Thomas and eager to improve his English. (At one point, he summons Mr. Thomas from his cell in the city’s detention center to ask him what the “Wuthering” in “Wuthering Heights” means.)

By pretending to believe that Mr. Thomas intended to use the hashish himself rather than sell it, he smooths the way for a light sentence to be handed down. Continue reading the main story

After all those dull months teaching English to Korean students, Mr. Thomas suddenly finds himself among fascinating people. He meets Billy the Kid, a Colombian gem smuggler and jailhouse lawyer with whom he reads Nietzsche and Tolstoy, and develops a philosophy for dealing with prison life. He listens in wonder to the exploits of a Peruvian who wanders the world with a gang of well-dressed thieves who steal suitcases in hotels and airports. He befriends, and tries to understand, a fellow American who has smothered his two sons.

Alone in his cell, Mr. Thomas struggles with shame, self-doubt, soul-destroying boredom and a long list of fundamental life questions that most people are too busy to address. He is afraid, lonely and angry. He cries and he rages. “I saw myself variously as an idiot and a clown, then an alchemist who might turn isolation into strength, then a cipher, a shut-out,” he writes.His American citizenship gives him status. So does his language, which all Koreans, even the guards, are eager to learn. At the same time, as one of perhaps a hundred foreign prisoners in Korea, he is culturally isolated, confused by a language he speaks with difficulty and a system of cultural norms that baffle him.Nothing much happens in prison, but the details are fascinating. As Mr. Thomas describes it, violence is limited to occasional scuffles, and the atmosphere of terror and intimidation in American prisons is absent. Although consensual sex occurs, usually for pay, rape is unknown. It’s no “Midnight Express.” In an unspoken arrangement, gangs keep order in exchange for privileges.

The physical conditions, however, are harsh. In winter, water freezes in unheated cells, and so does the ink in Mr. Thomas’s pen. The diet leans heavily on low-quality rice and kimchi, the famous Korean condiment of spicy pickled cabbage. Dirty electric razors leave Mr. Thomas with painful boils on his face, and by the end of his term he develops parasites.He does not complain. Quite the contrary. “I didn’t mind having few possessions, and could see the value in being removed from the noise and consumption of the outside world,” he writes. He and his fellow prisoners, he reflects wryly, live a model lifestyle, “like progressive ascetics.”Like Solzhenitsyn’s Denisovich, Mr. Thomas finds a grim satisfaction in work. He is happy to cobble shoes for the Korean riot police at the rate of 80 cents a day. Even better than the loose camaraderie and open spaces of the factory floor is the prison sports program. Each factory has a basketball team, and Mr. Thomas, a first-round draft pick, emerges as the Michael Jordan of the South Korean penal system. The rules combine the N.B.A. and Confucius. When Mr. Thomas is tackled on a drive to the basket, no one seems to regard this as a foul, but the players can see that he is upset. As a face-saving solution, he is awarded four free throws.Mr. Thomas is not a deep or complex thinker. Sincerity and earnestness are his strong points. A romantic to the end, he confronts his situation with Thoreau ready to hand, drawing simple conclusions from hard lessons, taking pleasure in small things, and appreciating the unexpected turn his life has taken. “I was at the end of the earth,” he reflects toward the end of his prison term.  Like his hero Burton, he writes, “I’d entered a forbidden city, lived among a bizarre and wondrous people, gained knowledge of a province previously unknown to my race.”Splendid. But Mom adds a badly needed coda. On greeting her son at the airport in New York, she cries, hugs him and holds him at arm’s length to take a good look. Then she slaps him and says, “Don’t ever do that again.”

About Brother One Cell
Cullen Thomas had a typical suburban upbringing. He was raised on Long Island, and after graduating from college he was looking for meaning and excitement. Possessed of a youthful, romantic view of the world, he left New York at age twenty-three and set off for a job teaching English in Seoul, South Korea. As foreigners on the fringe of Korean society, Cullen and his friends felt intensely separate, then untouchable. That delusion was quickly shattered. Cullen would spend four years in the country: seven months teaching, then three and a half years in jail for smuggling hashish. BROTHER ONE CELL is his memoir of that time–the harrowing and powerful story of a young American learning hard lessons in strange prisons on the other side of the world.One of few foreign inmates, Cullen shared a cell block with human traffickers, jewel smugglers, murderers, and thieves. Humbled by the ordeal, he describes his fight to restore his identity and to come to terms with the harsh living conditions and the rules of Korea’s strict Confucian culture, which were magnified in prison. In this crucible Cullen shed the naïveté and ego of youth and to his surprise achieved a lasting sense of freedom and gratitude. With its gritty descriptions of life behind high walls and acute insights into Korean society, BROTHER ONE CELL is part cautionary tale and part insightful travelogue about places few of us will ever see.

Thomas' _Brother One Cell:_ a chronicle of an American abroad -- in prison

It would appear that Dr. R. (Ralph) Cullen Thomas Jr. MD, Board Certrified, JD may be practicing a dual medical life and may have decided to defray his bariatric practice in favor of other insurance enabled practices like hernia surgery according to this web site:rnrnhttp://picog.comrnrnAt this web site I found disturbing information and links to other sources about Dr. Thomas. Please save your self and research him on the web before allowing him to cut your body. I was not happy with what he did to me more than a year ago. In fact I had to have a second surgery because he couldn't do it right the first time. The problem is he also failed to fix it the second time.

He is a really nice person to have for a doctor and has an excellent staff. Never tries to rush thru your appointment.

My first impression was definitely a good one. He left me feeling comfortable and confident about my choice for the surgery. After have gone through surgery, my opionion has changed but for the better. He's made me a new person on the outside which has helped me change this on the inside. He's a wonderful man. His staff was AMAZING they kept you up to date on everything. Stephanie, he's nurse, is wonderful. She's very up front, helpful, and encouraging. I have found nothing that I disliked about my surgeon or his staff. Future patients should know he is no longer preforming these surgeries. As to why, I do not know. He did a good job on the aftercare. You were giving a booklet from a nutrionist that told you what to follow for the coming year or so. He was very upfront with the risk the surgery does bring and the complications it may cause. He doesn't do it to scare you but to make sure you're aware about what you're about to do to change your life. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give him an 8. He was a wonderful surgeon, I've had NO complications. Also, he had wonderful bedside manner. Thank you, Dr. Cullen's..

My surgeon has changed to Dr. Thomas. I was first introduced to him at the seminar in March that he conducted. However, I met him personally on 05-26-04. He seemed very nice and answered all of my questions and concerns regarding the procedure. ********I have not met Dr. Totoro at the present time. I am scheduled to attend a seminar on 03-09-04, after getting the insurance to approve me for the consultation. I will update my initial thoughts and feelings after I have had my consultation. ******** I attended a seminar with Dr. Pearce in 02/2003. He was very comforting and held a wealth of knowledge. I found out that Healthchoice has a strict exclusion policy so I will continue to shop around and gather information on various surgeons before making a decision. ********I attended a seminar today 10-01-03 with Dr. Philip Floyd. He seemed very nice and eager to perform the surgery on those that were truly interested. In the seminar he really stressed the issues of aftercare and issues related to the surgery. I do not know for sure because I am still having to deal with the insurance situation. I will continue to shop around until I feel led to the right surgeon.

Wonderful, knowledgeable Dr. I liked his manner and the way he explained everything. He really seems to care about the obese and helping them. I'm glad I will have Dr. Thomas. His staff was very friendly, in fact everyone I encountered at Mercy were very nice, helpful and friendly. I rate Dr. Thomas as a 10+.


May 25, 2004






















SharonO 




My first and current impression is that he will do a great job!! He is very personable, and so is everyone in his office -- you feel that they care!! He stresses aftercare is very important.I would rate him excellent overall!! I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone!!

queenbeeme 




I was extremly impressed when I met Dr. Thomas, he was very friendly and answered all my questions without beating around the bush. Both of his nurses Stephanie and Bonnie have been great to deal with, they always return my calls and have answered all my questions. Dr. Thomas is a stickler about after care, and I think that's great... I'm having surgery on March 30th and the next support group meeting is 2 days after that, I wonder if I'll be able to make it down to the conference center to the meeting... If I was going to rate Dr. Thomas and his staff on a scale of 1-10 at this point pre-op, I'd give everyone of them a 10++++

Dr. Cullen Thomas is very nice and caring.He really knows his stuff.

MARKfromOKC 




I was very impressed with Dr. Thomas. We went to his seminar and he really laid out all the pros and cons. I am glad I switched surgeons.


Feb. 7, 2004






















Erin W. 




My surgeon was Dr. Cullen Thomas in Oklahoma City. He was amazing! He's very straight forward and serious about his job. Yet, not in a rude way. He's very friendly and kind. He always answers any questions you may have. He did a great job the day of surgery. I didn't have any complications at all. After surgery, he would stop by my room and check on me often. He has a wonderful staff too! Stephanie, his nurse, is one of the sweetest people you will ever meet! She's very supportive, helpful, and very kind. Any time I have a question for her or Dr. Thomas, she's very prompt getting back to me with an answer. I really can't say enough good things about my experience with my doctor and his staff. I couldn't be happier with my choice! They've all been so great! I would definitely recommend him to anyone.
