About Us






We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company discovering and developing targeted therapeutics in disease areas of inflammation and immuno-oncology. Our primary focus is anti-inflammatory product candidates targeting SH2-containing inositol-5'-phosphatase 1, or SHIP1, which is a key regulator of an important cellular signaling pathway in immune cells, known as the PI3K pathway. Our lead product candidate, AQX-1125, is a small molecule activator of SHIP1 suitable for oral, once daily dosing. Having successfully completed multiple preclinical studies and seven clinical trials with AQX-1125, we have now advanced into Phase 3 trials with AQX-1125 in our lead indication of bladder interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Aquinox has a broad intellectual property portfolio and pipeline of preclinical drug candidates that activate SHIP1.

AQX-1125







The SHIP1 Pathway - Highlighting the Role of AQX-1125
 
Click graphic for enlarged view.
AQX-1125 is our lead product candidate and has generated positive clinical data from three completed clinical trials, including two proof-of-concept trials, one in COPD and one in allergic asthma, demonstrating a favorable safety profile and anti-inflammatory activity. Overall, more than 100 subjects have received AQX-1125. Importantly, our clinical trial results were consistent with the drug-like properties and anti-inflammatory activities demonstrated in our preclinical studies. AQX-1125 is a once daily oral capsule with many desirable drug-like properties. We are currently investigating AQX-1125 in two Phase 2 clinical trials, one in COPD and one in BPS/IC.
Based on our three completed clinical trials, we have demonstrated that AQX-1125:
has desirable pharmacokinetic, absorption and excretion properties that make it suitable for once daily oral administration;
is generally well tolerated, exhibiting mild to moderate adverse events primarily related to gastrointestinal upset that resolve without treatment or long-term effects and are reduced by taking the drug candidate with food; and
has anti-inflammatory properties consistent with those exhibited in preclinical studies and exhibited activity in two trials using two distinct inflammatory challenges.
AQX-1125 is an activator of SHIP1, which controls the PI3K cellular signaling pathway. If the PI3K pathway is overactive, immune cells can produce an abundance of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules and migrate to and concentrate in tissues, resulting in excessive or chronic inflammation. SHIP1 is predominantly expressed in cells derived from bone marrow tissues, which are mainly immune cells. Therefore drugs that activate SHIP1 can reduce the function and migration of immune cells and have an anti-inflammatory effect. By controlling the PI3K pathway, AQX-1125 reduces immune cell function and migration by targeting a mechanism that has evolved in nature to maintain homeostasis of the immune system.
AQX-1125 has demonstrated compelling preclinical activity in a broad range of relevant inflammatory studies including preclinical models of COPD, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, BPS/IC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In these studies we have seen a meaningful reduction in the relevant immune cells that are the cells that cause inflammation, such as neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages, and a reduction in the symptoms of inflammation, such as pain and swelling. The activity, efficacy and potency seen with AQX-1125 in most preclinical studies compare favorably to published results with corticosteroids. In addition, AQX-1125 demonstrated compelling activity in the smoke airway inflammation and Bleomycin Fibrosis models, which are known to be steroid refractory, or in other words, do not respond to corticosteroids. We believe this broad anti-inflammatory profile is not typical amongst drugs in development and supports the therapeutic potential for AQX-1125.
In addition to demonstrating strong in vitro and in vivo activity, AQX-1125 was also selected as a lead candidate based on its many desirable drug-like properties. The drug candidate is highly water soluble and does not require complex formulation for oral administration. AQX-1125 has low plasma protein binding, is not metabolized and is excreted unmetabolized in both urine and feces. After oral or intravenous dosing, AQX-1125 reaches high concentrations in respiratory, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, all of which have mucosal surfaces of therapeutic interest. In humans, AQX-1125 has shown pharmacokinetic properties suitable for once-a-day dosing. In addition, the absorption of the drug candidate is equivalent whether taken with or without food.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
