We have purchased over 1,700 properties in the last 10 years, but raising capital has always been one of the hardest, most time-intensive things we had to do. RealtyShares has made raising capital basically an afterthought – it is simple, streamlined, and FAST.Alex SifakisPresident, JWB Real Estate CapitalCommon QuestionsWhy should I raise money through RealtyShares?
RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

Expense Ratio as disclosed in the May 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio: 0.76%
Net Expense Ratio: 0.75%
Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund's investment manager (the "Manager"), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse the Fund total annual so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding brokerage fees and commissions, taxes, and, upon approval of the Board, extraordinary expenses) never exceed 0.75% of average daily net assets. Absent such arrangements, returns would have been lower. This commitment is currently expected to remain in place for the life of the Funds, can only be amended or terminated by agreement of the Fund and the Manager and will terminate automatically in the event of termination of the investment management agreement between the Fund and the Manager
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Periods greater than 12 months are annualized. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. 
During certain periods presented above, the advisor waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses. Without this arrangement, performance would be lower.
The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 large-capitalization stocks that is frequently used as a general measure of U.S. stock market performance. The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index contains all tax-qualified REITs except timber and infrastructure REITs with more than 50% of total assets in qualifying real estate assets other than mortgages secured by real property that also meet minimum size and liquidity criteria.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.
Because of its concentration in real estate securities, the Fund is subject to special risk considerations described in the Fund's prospectus, which is available on this website .

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. 
The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).

Important Information
Expense Ratio as disclosed in the May 1, 2017 prospectus:
Gross Expense Ratio: 0.76%
Net Expense Ratio: 0.75%.
Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund's investment manager (the "Manager"), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse the Fund total annual so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding brokerage fees and commissions, taxes, and, upon approval of the Board, extraordinary expenses) never exceed 0.75% of average daily net assets. Absent such arrangements, returns would have been lower. This commitment is currently expected to remain in place for the life of the Funds, can only be amended or terminated by agreement of the Fund and the Manager and will terminate automatically in the event of termination of the investment management agreement between the Fund and the Manager

NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Risks of Investing in Real Estate Securities
Risks of investing in real estate securities are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate, including falling property values due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, political or technological developments, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, political and economic uncertainties, and differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies. The Fund is classified as a "non-diversified" fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund. However, the Fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws. No representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved.
For U.S. residents only.
For funds with at least a 3-year history, a Morningstar Rating (tm) is based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees) with emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variaitons in the distribution percentages.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 230 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return through investment in real estate securities.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80%, and normally substantially all, of its total assets in common stocks and other equity securities issued by real estate companies. It may invest up to 20% of its total assets in securities of foreign issuers (including emerging market issuers) which meet the same criteria for investment as domestic companies, including investments in such companies in the form of American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs") and European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs"). The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.

Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
