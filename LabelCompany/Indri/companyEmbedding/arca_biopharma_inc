Genetic-AF
Clinical Trial
Phase 2B/3















Status


GENETIC-AF is currently enrolling patients in U.S., Canada and Europe




200 Patients enrolled as of April 26, 2017




Phase 2B interim efficacy analysis outcome anticipated in August 2017 (Guidance as of June 20, 2017)

















Summary of Trial




GENETIC-AF
A Genotype-Directed Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Bucindolol and Toprol-XL for Prevention of Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter in Patients With Heart Failure




GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro™ against an active comparator, the beta-blocker Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro™.  A subset of patients in the trial will also undergo continuous heart rhythm monitoring to assess AF burden, which is defined as the amount of time per day that a patient experiences AF. These data will be collected via newly or previously implanted Medtronic devices capable of assessing AF burden (for example, implantable loop recorders, pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices). The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality.

Precision Medicine
Pharmacogenetics for cardiovascular diseases
Precision Medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Pharmacogenetics is the study of inherited genetic differences in drug metabolic pathways which can affect individual responses to drugs, both in terms of therapeutic effect as well as adverse effects.

Cardiovascular Disease and Atrial Fibrillation




Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Diseases under the cardiovascular disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you’re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
Atrial fibrillation (AF, or A-fib) is a disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular and uncoordinated. The irregular contraction pattern associated with AF causes blood to pool…

Gencaro™







An Unmet Need
Our lead product candidate, Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride), is a pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are evaluating in a clinical trial for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation, or AF, in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFREF.

Beta-blockers, a well characterized class of drugs, target cardiac myocytes to reduce adverse beta1- adrenergic signaling that causes cardiac chamber remodeling. We believe Gencaro’s mechanism of action (MOA) is unique among beta-blockers due to its sympatholytic (norepinephrine lowering) and inverse agonism (inactivation of constitutively active receptors) properties.
We have identified common genetic variations in receptors in the cardiovascular system that we believe interact with Gencaro’s pharmacology and may predict patient response to the drug. The genotype which responds most favorably to Gencaro, beta-1 389 arginine homozygous, is present in approximately 50% of the U.S. population.
The approved therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain disadvantages in heart failure patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects, and most of the approved drugs for AF are contraindicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. We believe there is an unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects than currently available therapies and are more effective, particularly in heart failure patients.







Gencaro™ Heart Failure Development Program Summary
Gencaro™ has been studied in seven clinical trials in HFREF patients and 1 clinical trial in myocardial infarction (MI) patients, comprising over 3,000 patients. Gencaro™ is currently being evaluated in the GENETIC-AF clinical trial as a potential treatment for atrial fibrillation in HFREF patients.

ARCA biopharma, Inc. Key Developments

Arca Biopharma Announces Database Lock for Genetic-AF Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis
Jun 20 17
ARCA biopharma, Inc. announced database lock for the GENETIC-AF Phase 2B interim efficacy analysis, to be conducted by the trial Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). GENETIC-AF is a seamless design Phase 2B/3 clinical trial evaluating GencaroTM (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a potential treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). The company expects to announce the DSMB’s recommendation based on this interim analysis in August 2017. The Gencaro development program has previously been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/AFL or all-cause mortality. The GENETIC-AF trial design has been reviewed by the FDA. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis: The DSMB will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data from a minimum of 150 patients with evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. The primary analysis will include data from all randomized subjects at the time of database lock. The primary analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The primary analysis method will generate predictive probability of success (PPoS) values that will be compared to prespecified PPoS boundaries constructed from Bayesian statistical modeling. Prospectively defined PPoS ranges have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an effectiveness signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects (approximately 250 patients), based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3; and 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility, if the PPoS results fall below the boundary for completion as a Phase 2 trial.


ARCA biopharma, Inc. Announces Unaudited Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 15 17
ARCA biopharma, Inc. announced unaudited earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported loss from operations of $4,381,000 against $3,668,000 a year ago. Net loss was $4,338,000 or $0.48 basic and diluted per share against $3,647,000 or $0.40 basic and diluted per share a year ago.


ARCA Biopharma, Inc. Announces 200 Patient Randomized into the GENETIC-AF Seamless Design Phase 2B/3 Clinical Trial
Apr 26 17
ARCA biopharma, Inc. announced that the 200 patient has been randomized into the GENETIC-AF clinical trial evaluating Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) as potentially the first genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial: GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/AFL or all-cause mortality. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis: The GENETIC-AF Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data when at least 150 patients have evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. The analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate. The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The relative benefit estimate will utilize Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the predictive probability of the Phase 3 patient cohort hazard ratio (a measure of an effect of an intervention on an outcome of interest over time) based on the interim Phase 2B data. Prospectively defined ranges of predictive probabilities have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an effectiveness signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects (approximately 250 patients), based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3; or, immediate termination of the trial due to futility.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
