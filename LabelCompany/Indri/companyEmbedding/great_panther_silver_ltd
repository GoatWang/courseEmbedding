TSX: GPRNYSE MKT: GPL
VANCOUVER, July 13, 2017 /CNW/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR; NYSE MKT: GPL) ("Great Panther"; the "Company") announces production results for the second quarter ("Q2") 2017 from its two wholly-owned Mexican silver mining operations: the Topia Mine in Durango and the Guanajuato Mine Complex ("GMC"), which includes the San Ignacio Mine.
Second Quarter 2017 Production Highlights (Compared to Second Quarter 2016)

Consolidated metal production increased 6% to a record 1,102,290 silver equivalent ounces ("Ag eq oz") 
Silver production increased 6% to 569,229 silver ounces ("Ag oz") 
Gold production decreased 8% to 5,543 gold ounces ("Au oz") 
Ore processed decreased 1%, with 98,576 tonnes milled


"Great Panther had an excellent second quarter, setting a new Company record for consolidated metal production and a new record for metal production in Topia," stated Robert Archer, President & CEO.  "I would like to congratulate our entire operations team, especially in Topia, for all their hard work and efforts in achieving this quarter's milestones."

 Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.  


 (2) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively. 


 (3) 
 The Topia processing plant was shut down for upgrades in Q1 2017 and so had no production during that period. 





Guanajuato Mine Complex
In Q2 2017, metal production at the GMC was 2% lower than the previous quarter, and decreased by 8%, to 715,423 Ag eq oz, when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.  The decrease was attributed to lower tonnes milled from San Ignacio, combined with lower overall grades, mainly reflecting variability in the mineral resource.  Additional exploration drilling and development is being undertaken to improve the resource definition in these areas.

 (1) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio. 





San Ignacio accounted for 55% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q2 2017, compared to 62% in Q2 2016.  The decrease partially accounted for the lower average gold grades as San Ignacio has a higher gold:silver ratio.  The increase in the proportion of production from the Guanajuato mines partially compensated for the decrease from San Ignacio and resulted in the higher metallurgical recoveries.
Exploration drilling increased during the second quarter of 2017, compared to the previous quarter, with a focus on enhancing ore zone definition and increasing mineral resources.  Following the encouraging indications from the drilling program at San Ignacio (announced on June 19, 2017), exploration development and drilling along strike of the current workings were fast-tracked with the objective of better defining the newly-identified mineralization.
Topia Mine 
Milling operations returned to design capacity in the second quarter of 2017, following the commissioning of the new tailings handling facility and the upgraded processing plant.  The operation is now producing exclusively dry tailings through the new filtration plant.  All tailings are being deposited on the Phase I Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") while the Company continues its efforts to obtain the Phase II permit from SEMARNAT (the Mexican environmental permitting agency).  
Topia achieved a record 386,867 Ag eq oz in metal production, reflecting an increase of 47% compared to the second quarter of 2016.  This was attributed to a combination of higher tonnes milled, higher grades of feed material and improved recoveries.  The increase in tonnes milled reflects maximizing the plant capacity by processing a controlled blend of run-of-mine production and ore stockpiled during the scheduled plant shutdown.  The improved metallurgical recoveries were attributed to improved control over the mill feed and head grade, coupled with the recent plant upgrades.  The increase in grades was due to a greater focus on selective mining, dilution control and ore sorting.

 Milling operation suspended to facilitate plant upgrades and the transition to new tailings handling and storage facilities. 





OUTLOOK
The Company is maintaining its guidance of 4.0 – 4.1 million Ag eq oz (based on a 70:1 silver:gold ratio) for 2017 and continues to believe that it will be able to obtain a permit for the Phase II tailings facility at Topia without interruption of operations.  However, the deposition of dry tailings on the Phase I TSF cannot continue indefinitely and the Company cannot provide complete assurance that a disruption can be avoided.  Discussions to date with the authorities and other stakeholders have been positive and are continuing.
The Company is also maintaining its previously issued cash cost and all-in sustaining cost ("AISC") guidance for 2017 of US$5 – 6 per payable silver ounce, and US$14 – 16 per payable silver ounce, respectively1.  
There is a risk that guidance will be affected if the Company is unable to obtain a permit for the Topia Phase II TSF on a timely basis or at all.  In the event there is a significant change to the Company's production guidance expectations, the Company will provide a timely update to the market.
The previously announced acquisition of the Coricancha Mine Complex ("CMC") in Peru, currently on care and maintenance, was completed effective June 30, 2017.  The Company's plans include further evaluations of the mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study ("PFS").  Depending upon the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could commence in 2018.  The Company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for the Coricancha Mine, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert F. Brown, P. Eng., who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia Mine and the Coricancha Mine Complex under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.

TSX: GPRNYSE MKT: GPL
VANCOUVER, July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR; NYSE MKT:GPL) ("Great Panther"; the "Company") announces production results for the second quarter ("Q2") 2017 from its two wholly-owned Mexican silver mining operations: the Topia Mine in Durango and the Guanajuato Mine Complex ("GMC"), which includes the San Ignacio Mine.

Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively. 







(2)





Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.







(3)





The Topia processing plant was shut down for upgrades in Q1 2017 and so had no production during that period.






Guanajuato Mine Complex
In Q2 2017, metal production at the GMC was 2% lower than the previous quarter, and decreased by 8%, to 715,423 Ag eq oz, when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.  The decrease was attributed to lower tonnes milled from San Ignacio, combined with lower overall grades, mainly reflecting variability in the mineral resource.  Additional exploration drilling and development is being undertaken to improve the resource definition in these areas.

Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio.






San Ignacio accounted for 55% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q2 2017, compared to 62% in Q2 2016.  The decrease partially accounted for the lower average gold grades as San Ignacio has a higher gold:silver ratio.  The increase in the proportion of production from the Guanajuato mines partially compensated for the decrease from San Ignacio and resulted in the higher metallurgical recoveries.
Exploration drilling increased during the second quarter of 2017, compared to the previous quarter, with a focus on enhancing ore zone definition and increasing mineral resources.  Following the encouraging indications from the drilling program at San Ignacio (announced on June 19, 2017), exploration development and drilling along strike of the current workings were fast-tracked with the objective of better defining the newly-identified mineralization.
Topia Mine
Milling operations returned to design capacity in the second quarter of 2017, following the commissioning of the new tailings handling facility and the upgraded processing plant.  The operation is now producing exclusively dry tailings through the new filtration plant.  All tailings are being deposited on the Phase I Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") while the Company continues its efforts to obtain the Phase II permit from SEMARNAT (the Mexican environmental permitting agency).  
Topia achieved a record 386,867 Ag eq oz in metal production, reflecting an increase of 47% compared to the second quarter of 2016.  This was attributed to a combination of higher tonnes milled, higher grades of feed material and improved recoveries.  The increase in tonnes milled reflects maximizing the plant capacity by processing a controlled blend of run-of-mine production and ore stockpiled during the scheduled plant shutdown.  The improved metallurgical recoveries were attributed to improved control over the mill feed and head grade, coupled with the recent plant upgrades.  The increase in grades was due to a greater focus on selective mining, dilution control and ore sorting.

Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively. 







(2)





Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.

Milling operation suspended to facilitate plant upgrades and the transition to new tailings handling and storage facilities.






OUTLOOK
The Company is maintaining its guidance of 4.0 - 4.1 million Ag eq oz (based on a 70:1 silver:gold ratio) for 2017 and continues to believe that it will be able to obtain a permit for the Phase II tailings facility at Topia without interruption of operations.  However, the deposition of dry tailings on the Phase I TSF cannot continue indefinitely and the Company cannot provide complete assurance that a disruption can be avoided.  Discussions to date with the authorities and other stakeholders have been positive and are continuing.
The Company is also maintaining its previously issued cash cost and all-in sustaining cost ("AISC") guidance for 2017 of US$5 - 6 per payable silver ounce, and US$14 - 16 per payable silver ounce, respectively1.  
There is a risk that guidance will be affected if the Company is unable to obtain a permit for the Topia Phase II TSF on a timely basis or at all.  In the event there is a significant change to the Company's production guidance expectations, the Company will provide a timely update to the market.
The previously announced acquisition of the Coricancha Mine Complex ("CMC") in Peru, currently on care and maintenance, was completed effective June 30, 2017.  The Company's plans include further evaluations of the mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study ("PFS").  Depending upon the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could commence in 2018.  The Company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for the Coricancha Mine, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert F. Brown, P. Eng., who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia Mine and the Coricancha Mine Complex under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.

Brown, P. Eng., who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia Mine and the Coricancha Mine Complex under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.__________________________________1 Cash cost and AISC are non-IFRS measures.

TSX: GPRNYSE MKT: GPL


VANCOUVER, July 3, 2017 /CNW/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR) (NYSE MKT: GPL) ("Great Panther" or the "Company") announces the closing of its previously announced acquisition of the Coricancha gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper underground mine and mill complex (the "CMC") from subsidiaries of Nyrstar N.V. ("Nyrstar").  The CMC is located in the central Andes of Peru, approximately 90 kilometres by paved highway east of the city of Lima.  
The acquisition was completed effective June 30, 2017 as a share purchase whereby the Company's wholly owned Peruvian subsidiary ("GP Peru") acquired all of the shares of Nyrstar Coricancha S.A. ("Coricancha") from subsidiaries of Nyrstar.  Coricancha owns a 100% interest in the CMC.  The acquisition was completed pursuant to the Amended Share Purchase Agreement announced on June 14, 2017, subsequently amended to address certain follow-on agreements (the "Final Share Purchase Agreement").  Under the terms of the Final Share Purchase Agreement, Great Panther will pay a purchase price to Nyrstar comprising US$0.1 million to be paid shortly following closing, and earn-out consideration of up to US$10.0 million.  Under the earn-out, Nyrstar will be paid 15% of the free cash-flow generated by the CMC during the 5-year period after which the CMC is cumulative free cash-flow positive.  
"The acquisition of Coricancha represents a major milestone for Great Panther Silver, and the culmination of our search for the right asset to build a foundation in Peru," stated Robert Archer, President & CEO.  "The project has excellent potential to be a new mine for the Company, and we are immediately ramping up our evaluation toward that goal."
The CMC is a fully permitted polymetallic mine that includes an operational 600 tonne per day flotation and gold BIOX® bio-leach plant along with supporting mining infrastructure.  The CMC has been on care and maintenance since August 2013.  The CMC property comprises more than 3,700 hectares in the prolific Central Polymetallic Belt and production at the mine dates back to 1906.  Gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper mineralization (approximately 80% gold-silver by value) occurs as massive sulphide veins that have been mined by cut and fill extraction methods.  
Great Panther's plans include further evaluations of the current mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study ("PFS").  Depending upon the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could commence in 2018.  The Company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for the CMC, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
Nyrstar has agreed to be responsible for the cost of reclamation work, and any associated fines, that Coricancha will undertake at the CMC, related to certain legacy tailings facilities, subject to agreed maximum amounts.  In addition, Nyrstar will maintain the existing CMC mine closure bond for three years. 
The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert F. Brown, P. Eng., consultant to the Company, who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the CMC under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.

Great Panther Silver Completes Acquisition of Coricancha Polymetallic Mine in Peru
Canada NewsWire






VANCOUVER, July 3, 2017


 TSX: GPR  NYSE MKT: GPL 


  VANCOUVER , July 3, 2017 /CNW/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR) (NYSE MKT: GPL) ("Great Panther" or the "Company") announces the closing of its previously announced acquisition of the Coricancha gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper underground mine and mill complex (the "CMC") from subsidiaries of Nyrstar N.V. ("Nyrstar").  The CMC is located in the central Andes of Peru, approximately 90 kilometres by paved highway east of the city of Lima.  
The acquisition was completed effective June 30, 2017 as a share purchase whereby the Company's wholly owned Peruvian subsidiary ("GP Peru") acquired all of the shares of Nyrstar Coricancha S.A. ("Coricancha") from subsidiaries of Nyrstar.  Coricancha owns a 100% interest in the CMC.  The acquisition was completed pursuant to the Amended Share Purchase Agreement announced on June 14, 2017, subsequently amended to address certain follow-on agreements (the "Final Share Purchase Agreement").  Under the terms of the Final Share Purchase Agreement, Great Panther will pay a purchase price to Nyrstar comprising US$0.1 million to be paid shortly following closing, and earn-out consideration of up to US$10.0 million.  Under the earn-out, Nyrstar will be paid 15% of the free cash-flow generated by the CMC during the 5-year period after which the CMC is cumulative free cash-flow positive.  
"The acquisition of Coricancha represents a major milestone for Great Panther Silver, and the culmination of our search for the right asset to build a foundation in Peru," stated Robert Archer, President & CEO.  "The project has excellent potential to be a new mine for the Company, and we are immediately ramping up our evaluation toward that goal."
The CMC is a fully permitted polymetallic mine that includes an operational 600 tonne per day flotation and gold BIOX® bio-leach plant along with supporting mining infrastructure.  The CMC has been on care and maintenance since August 2013.  The CMC property comprises more than 3,700 hectares in the prolific Central Polymetallic Belt and production at the mine dates back to 1906.  Gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper mineralization (approximately 80% gold-silver by value) occurs as massive sulphide veins that have been mined by cut and fill extraction methods.  
Great Panther's plans include further evaluations of the current mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study ("PFS").  Depending upon the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could commence in 2018.  The Company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for the CMC, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
Nyrstar has agreed to be responsible for the cost of reclamation work, and any associated fines, that Coricancha will undertake at the CMC, related to certain legacy tailings facilities, subject to agreed maximum amounts.  In addition, Nyrstar will maintain the existing CMC mine closure bond for three years. 
The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert F. Brown, P. Eng., consultant to the Company, who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the CMC under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This website and the documents posted on this website contain forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. These forward-looking statements may include statements regarding perceived merit of properties, exploration results and budgets, mineral reserves and resource estimates, work programs, capital expenditures, operating costs, cash flow estimates, production estimates and similar statements relating to the economic viability of a project, timelines, strategic plans, including the Company’s plans and expectations relating to its projects, completion of transactions, market prices for precious and base metals, or other statements that are not statements of fact. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. Statements concerning mineral resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute "forward-looking statements” to the extent that they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed.
Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, identified by words or phrases such as "expects”, "is expected”, "anticipates”, "believes”, "plans”, "projects”, "estimates”, "assumes”, "intends”, "strategy”, "goals”, "objectives”, "potential”, "possible” or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events, conditions or results "may”, "could”, "would”, "should”, "might” or "will” be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material assumptions, including those listed below, which could prove to be significantly incorrect:

our ability to achieve production at any of the Company’s mineral exploration and development properties;
estimated capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns; 
estimated metal pricing, metallurgy, mineability, marketability and operating and capital costs, together with other assumptions underlying the Company’s resource and reserve estimates; 
our expected ability to develop adequate infrastructure and that the cost of doing so will be reasonable; 
assumptions that all necessary permits and governmental approvals will be obtained; 
assumptions made in the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of the Company’s mineral deposits; 
our expectations regarding demand for equipment, skilled labour and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties; and 
our activities will not be adversely disrupted or impeded by development, operating or regulatory risks.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:

uncertainty of whether there will ever be production at the Company’s mineral exploration and development properties; 
uncertainty of estimates of capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns; 
uncertainties relating to the assumptions underlying the Company’s resource and reserve estimates, such as metal pricing, metallurgy, mineability, marketability and operating and capital costs; 
risks related to the Company’s ability to commence production and generate material revenues or obtain adequate financing for its planned exploration and development activities;
risks related to the Company’s ability to finance the development of its mineral properties through external financing, strategic alliances, the sale of property interests or otherwise; 
risks related to the third parties on which the Company depends for its exploration and development activities; 
dependence on cooperation of joint venture partners in exploration and development of properties; 
credit, liquidity, interest rate and currency risks;
risks related to market events and general economic conditions; 
uncertainty related to inferred mineral resources; 
risks and uncertainties relating to the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of the Company’s mineral deposits; 
risks related to lack of infrastructure; 
mining and development risks, including risks related to infrastructure, accidents, equipment breakdowns, labor disputes or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in development, construction or production; 
the risk that permits and governmental approvals necessary to develop and operate mines on the Company’s properties will not be available on a timely basis or at all; 
commodity price fluctuations; 
risks related to governmental regulation and permits, including environmental regulation; 
risks related to the need for reclamation activities on the Company’s properties and uncertainty of cost estimates related thereto; 
uncertainty related to title to the Company’s mineral properties; 
the Company’s history of losses and expectation of future losses; 
uncertainty as to the outcome of potential litigation; 
uncertainty inherent in litigation including the effects of discovery of new evidence or advancement of new legal theories, the difficulty of predicting decisions of judges and juries and the possibility that decisions may be reversed on appeal; 
risks related to the Company’s significant shareholders; 
risks related to increases in demand for equipment, skilled labor and services needed for exploration and development of mineral properties, and related cost increases; 
increased competition in the mining industry; 
the Company’s need to attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel; 
risks related to the Company’s current practice of not using hedging arrangements; 
uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to acquire additional commercially mineable mineral rights; 
risks related to the integration of potential new acquisitions into the Company’s existing operations; 
risks related to unknown liabilities in connection with acquisitions; 
risks related to conflicts of interests of some of the directors of the Company; 
risks related to global climate change; 
risks related to adverse publicity from non-governmental organizations; 
uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to maintain the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting as per the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
increased regulatory compliance costs relating to the Dodd-Frank Act; 

This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company’s forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, without limitation, those referred to in Company’s Annual Information under the heading "Risk Factors” and elsewhere.
The Company’s forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management on the date the statements are made, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s beliefs, expectations or opinions should change, except as required by law. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS
Unless otherwise indicated, all reserve and resource estimates included or incorporated by reference on this website have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ("NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves ("CIM Definition Standards”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.
Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC”), and reserve and resource information contained in this presentation may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term "resource” does not equate to the term "‘reserves”. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve” unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. The SEC’s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning "measured mineral resources”, "indicated mineral resources” or "inferred mineral resources” or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute "reserves” by U.S. standards in documents filed with the SEC. U.S. investors should also understand that "inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an "inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated "inferred mineral resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an "inferred mineral resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of "contained ounces” in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute "reserves” by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of "reserves” are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by Great Panther in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as "reserves” under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable to information made public by companies that report in accordance with United States standards.
United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. United States investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
NON-SOLICITATION
This website is not intended as a solicitation or offering of securities in any jurisdiction and the information contained herein in no way should be construed or interpreted as such. No securities commission or other regulatory authority in Canada, the United States or any other country or jurisdiction has in any way passed upon this information and no representation or warranty is made by Great Panther to that effect.

TSX: GPRNYSE MKT: GPL
VANCOUVER, July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - GREAT PANTHER SILVER LIMITED (TSX: GPR; NYSE MKT: GPL) ("Great Panther"; the "Company") announces production results for the second quarter ("Q2") 2017 from its two wholly-owned Mexican silver mining operations: the Topia Mine in Durango and the Guanajuato Mine Complex ("GMC"), which includes the San Ignacio Mine.








Second Quarter 2017 Production Highlights (Compared to Second Quarter 2016)

Consolidated metal production increased 6% to a record 1,102,290 silver equivalent ounces ("Ag eq oz") 
Silver production increased 6% to 569,229 silver ounces ("Ag oz") 
Gold production decreased 8% to 5,543 gold ounces ("Au oz") 
Ore processed decreased 1%, with 98,576 tonnes milled

"Great Panther had an excellent second quarter, setting a new Company record for consolidated metal production and a new record for metal production in Topia," stated Robert Archer, President & CEO.  "I would like to congratulate our entire operations team, especially in Topia, for all their hard work and efforts in achieving this quarter's milestones."

 (1) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.  


 (2) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively. 


 (3) 
 The Topia processing plant was shut down for upgrades in Q1 2017 and so had no production during that period. 




Guanajuato Mine Complex
In Q2 2017, metal production at the GMC was 2% lower than the previous quarter, and decreased by 8%, to 715,423 Ag eq oz, when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.  The decrease was attributed to lower tonnes milled from San Ignacio, combined with lower overall grades, mainly reflecting variability in the mineral resource.  Additional exploration drilling and development is being undertaken to improve the resource definition in these areas.

 (1) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 and 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio. 




San Ignacio accounted for 55% of the total ore processed at the GMC in Q2 2017, compared to 62% in Q2 2016.  The decrease partially accounted for the lower average gold grades as San Ignacio has a higher gold:silver ratio.  The increase in the proportion of production from the Guanajuato mines partially compensated for the decrease from San Ignacio and resulted in the higher metallurgical recoveries.
Exploration drilling increased during the second quarter of 2017, compared to the previous quarter, with a focus on enhancing ore zone definition and increasing mineral resources.  Following the encouraging indications from the drilling program at San Ignacio (announced on June 19, 2017), exploration development and drilling along strike of the current workings were fast-tracked with the objective of better defining the newly-identified mineralization.
Topia Mine 
Milling operations returned to design capacity in the second quarter of 2017, following the commissioning of the new tailings handling facility and the upgraded processing plant.  The operation is now producing exclusively dry tailings through the new filtration plant.  All tailings are being deposited on the Phase I Tailings Storage Facility ("TSF") while the Company continues its efforts to obtain the Phase II permit from SEMARNAT (the Mexican environmental permitting agency).  
Topia achieved a record 386,867 Ag eq oz in metal production, reflecting an increase of 47% compared to the second quarter of 2016.  This was attributed to a combination of higher tonnes milled, higher grades of feed material and improved recoveries.  The increase in tonnes milled reflects maximizing the plant capacity by processing a controlled blend of run-of-mine production and ore stockpiled during the scheduled plant shutdown.  The improved metallurgical recoveries were attributed to improved control over the mill feed and head grade, coupled with the recent plant upgrades.  The increase in grades was due to a greater focus on selective mining, dilution control and ore sorting.

 (1) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2017 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0559 and 1:0.0676 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively.  


 (2) 
 Silver equivalent ounces for 2016 were calculated using a 70:1 Ag:Au ratio, and ratios of 1:0.0504 and 1:0.0504 for the price/ounce of silver to price/pound of lead and zinc, respectively. 


 (3) 
 Milling operation suspended to facilitate plant upgrades and the transition to new tailings handling and storage facilities. 




OUTLOOK
The Company is maintaining its guidance of 4.0 – 4.1 million Ag eq oz (based on a 70:1 silver:gold ratio) for 2017 and continues to believe that it will be able to obtain a permit for the Phase II tailings facility at Topia without interruption of operations.  However, the deposition of dry tailings on the Phase I TSF cannot continue indefinitely and the Company cannot provide complete assurance that a disruption can be avoided.  Discussions to date with the authorities and other stakeholders have been positive and are continuing.
The Company is also maintaining its previously issued cash cost and all-in sustaining cost ("AISC") guidance for 2017 of US$5 – 6 per payable silver ounce, and US$14 – 16 per payable silver ounce, respectively1.  
There is a risk that guidance will be affected if the Company is unable to obtain a permit for the Topia Phase II TSF on a timely basis or at all.  In the event there is a significant change to the Company's production guidance expectations, the Company will provide a timely update to the market.
The previously announced acquisition of the Coricancha Mine Complex ("CMC") in Peru, currently on care and maintenance, was completed effective June 30, 2017.  The Company's plans include further evaluations of the mine and processing infrastructure, mine rehabilitation and development in preparation for underground drilling, environmental studies, and the initiation of a preliminary feasibility study ("PFS").  Depending upon the outcome of the PFS, capital investments in support of restarting operations could commence in 2018.  The Company is currently working on an updated mineral resource estimate for the Coricancha Mine, which is expected to be completed towards the end of the third quarter of 2017.
The technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Robert F. Brown, P. Eng., who is the Qualified Person (QP) for the Guanajuato Mine Complex, the Topia Mine and the Coricancha Mine Complex under the meaning of NI 43-101.  Aspects relating to mining and metallurgy are overseen by Ali Soltani, Chief Operating Officer for Great Panther.

Apr 5, 2017 8:30 AM EDT









First Week of GPL October 20th Options Trading
Investors in Great Panther Silver Ltd saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 20th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 232 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

                Great Panther Silver Limited is a primary silver mining and exploration company. The company's current activities are focused on the mining of precious metals from its two wholly owned operating mines in Mexico: the Guanajuato mine complex, which includes the San Ignacio satellite mine, and the Topia mine in Durango.  In addition, the Company has recently signed an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Coricancha Mine Complex in the central Andes of Peru.

		"Great Panther Silver Limited's consolidated production in Q2/17 reached 569,229 oz silver and 5,543 oz gold, for a record 1.1 Moz silver equivalent. Total silver equivalent production increased 6% year over year and 52% from Q1/17. . .we maintain our Buy recommendation."

		"Great Panther Silver Limited hit some remarkable results from surface drilling at its San Ignacio mine. . .importantly, these results confirmed the continuation of strong gold-silver mineralization along strike of the current mine workings and have given the company enough confidence to begin drifting in the direction of the new results. These results, combined with the fact that silver is cheap, make a highly leveraged silver play like Great Panther a Buy."

		"On June 1, 2017, Great Panther Silver Limited announced that the commissioning phase of the Topia processing plant is complete. . .the plant, which now has new handling facilities for dry stackings, is currently operating at planned capacity. Since production at Topia has resumed, the company is processing stockpiled ore from the shutdown, in addition to run of mine ore, which should keep the processing plant running at capacity for the foreseeable future."

		"Great Panther Silver Limited reported Q1/17 revenue/EPS of $12.3M/$0.02 versus our estimate of $11.7M/$0.01, respectively. The revenue was higher than our estimate as the company realized comparatively higher prices for silver and gold of $19.33/oz and $1,297/oz versus our estimate of $17.75/oz Ag and $1,218.40/oz Au, respectively."

		"I continue to like Great Panther Silver Limited as a leveraged play on a bull market for silver, as well as for its steeply growing production profile over the next couple of years. That said, I wouldn't recommend catching a falling knife here, so we'll move it to a hold until the share price stabilizes."

		"During Q1/17, Great Panther Silver Limited  produced 364,995 oz silver and 5,177 oz gold for total silver equivalent production of 727,372 oz. . .we expect slightly higher throughout at Topia during the remainder of the year, which we believe should pave the way for the company to meet our annual production estimate of 4 Moz silver equivalent."

		
		

















Great Panther Is on the Prowl for Acquisitions
				(3/14/17)

			    		Great Panther Silver's modus operandi is to buy a past-producing mine, get it up and running as quickly as possible, and use the cash flow to fund more acquisitions, says CEO Bob Archer in this interview with The Gold Report. Having succeeded in Mexico with Guanajuato and Topia, the company is now taking on Coricancha in Peru.

		"On April 11, 2017, Great Panther Silver Limited reported Q1/17 production of 727,372 oz Ag eq versus our estimate of 716,462 oz Ag eq. Despite minimal production at the Topia mine, the company's Q1/17 production was higher than our estimate and primarily driven by higher metal grades at the Guanajuato mine complex."

		"Great Panther Silver Limited is about to take a major step forward with its purchase of the Coricancha mine in Peru on very favorable terms. This addition could boost the company's annual production by over 70%, beginning next year, and the market has yet to factor this into its projections; this factor makes Great Panther a Strong Buy near current levels."

		"During 2016, Great Panther Silver Limited produced 2 Moz silver and 22,238 oz gold for total silver equivalent production of approximately 3.9 Moz, in line with our silver equivalent production estimate of 4 Moz; cash cost per silver equivalent ounce fell to $10.35 from $11.32 the year prior, primarily driven by efficiency improvements and a decline in the Mexican peso. Given these figures, the company reported revenues of $61.9M."

		"Great Panther Silver Limited's underground drilling program yielded successful results at the Guanajuato mine complex (GMC) as the Measured and Indicated increased by 15%. . .overall the updated mineral resource estimate positively favors the NAV of the GMC, in our opinion.

		"Great Panther Silver Limited announced in mid-December that it has finally worked out an acceptable agreement to acquire the Coricancha gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper mine and mill complex from subsidiaries of Nyrstar.

		"Great Panther Silver Limited announced 2016 production results. . .we note that overall production totals were slightly hindered by the shutdowns at Topia related to the tailings expansion, and a variety of plant improvements. Overall, we remain impressed that production totals nearly reached our estimate despite the aforementioned capital improvements. . .production should bounce back to over 4 Moz AgEq in 2017�a run rate that we expect to remain consistent. . .Further, we expect a 4 Moz AgEq production rate to remain steady at the firm's Mexican operations, as focus shifts toward potentially advancing the Coricancha Mine."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. posted a strong Q3,based on the earnings numbers it released last month. . .the company�s revenue was $15.6 million, up 22% on a year-over-year basis. That increase,combined with an 8% decrease in all-in sustaining costs for metal production, led to mine operating earnings before non-cash items of $7.2 million, a 64% improvement over the same quarter last year. . .the company continues to be a smart play for those looking to leverage rising silver prices. . .in anticipation of higher silver prices and the potential for some moves on the corporate front, Great Panther is a buy."

		"On  Dec.  20,  Great  Panther  Silver Ltd. announced  an agreement with Nyrstar to acquire Coricancha, a polymetallic mine in Peru. . .this transaction presents Great Panther with substantial upside, as management believes Coricancha could produce 3 Moz AuEq/year, while limiting  downside  due  to  the  structure  of  the  transaction. .  .Great Panther's management team has remained steadfast in its commitment towards acquiring  the  right  assets  at  the  right  price. . .we continue to remain supporters of management's acquisition strategy and think the Coricancha purchase is a low-risk way to significantly add to Great Panther's consolidated production profile."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported net income of $2.1 million, which we feel was achieved primarily due to continued cost reduction across the firm's assets, coupled with a change in reporting currency to US$ resulting in the elimination of a non-cash foreign currency loss that had been reported in the past. . .we highlight that silver equivalent production to date has reached approximately 3.2 million ounces, which we feel strongly positions the firm to meet management's guidance of 4.0-4.2 million silver equivalent ounces as well as beat our estimate of just over 4.0 million silver equivalent ounces."

		"Given the environment in the metals and mining industry, Great Panther Silver Ltd. has successfully managed to lower its cash cost and all-in sustaining cost. . .Great Panther owns the Guanajuato Mines Complex, which we value at C$282.8 million, or C$1.52 per share. . .this valuation accounts for the strong market position that Great Panther has in the Guanajuato area,. . .the firm owns the Topia Mine, which we value at C$49.7 million, or C$0.27 per share. . .This estimate, calculated by using an 7% discount rate, seems appropriate due to the longstanding history of silver production in the area."

(8/5/16)

		
		"In our view, higher silver prices throughout H2/16 coupled with the elimination of one-time negative charges should place Great Panther Silver Ltd. in strong position to return to profitability during the remainder of the year. . .the company achieved impressive reductions in costs during the quarter as cash costs fell to $1.72 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs fell to $7.19 per ounce. . .we think the firm is well positioned to continue to produce at a steady state while improving costs and evaluating external opportunities for a potentially transformative acquisition."

		Between the cash flow from operations and the infusion provided by a recently closed bought-deal offering, Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s treasury should be flush for the foreseeable future. . .Great Panther should continue to benefit from (and provide leverage on) rising precious metals prices. Given that its operations are chugging along well, I see no reason why the company can't move higher in the back half of the year."

		"In the wake of Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s Q2/16 production results, Heiko Ihle of Rodman & Renshaw released a report that outlined the reasons behind a target price increase to $2.25/share, among them a "fully stocked" treasury following a recent bought-deal equity financing, stable production at San Ignacio and the company's focus on maintaining "low operating costs across its existing asset base while continuing to evaluate strategic external growth opportunities." Ihle noted that Rodman & Renshaw has not increased its "silver price deck from $17.50. . .any such changes should benefit companies with meaningful silver production such as Great Panther."

		"We feel the Guanajuato Mine Complex (GMC) showed itself to be a cornerstone asset that should serve as a foundation to fuel future growth initiatives for Great Panther Silver Ltd. . .as of Q3/15, San Ignacio accounted for approximately 50% of silver equivalent production at the GMC. . .in our view, resources at the GMC continue to underestimate the mining potential for the site. Although current resources outline a mine life of less than five years, we think the GMC should continue to operate for the foreseeable future. . .we expect Great Panther to continue its strategy of mining rather than expensive drilling."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. announced 2Q16 production results. During the quarter, the firm produced 536,726 ounces of silver and 6,010 ounces of gold for total silver equivalent production of just over 1.0 Moz�in line with our 2Q16 estimate of approximately 1.0 Moz AgEq. . .In our view, increased tonnage from San Ignacio paved the way for a 7% QoQ increase in gold production, which more than offset a slight dip in silver production during the quarter; we currently expect production rates to remain stable. . .We are maintaining a Buy rating while increasing our price target to $2.25/share."

Cash costs decreased by 52% on a year-over-year basis to US$4.20 per payable silver ounce. . .cash flow remained positive at CA$4M. . .Great Panther's share price remains up strongly from its early January levels. . .I think the precious metals markets may provide the company with a further lift in the back half of the year."

(5/6/16)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported Q1/16 revenue of CA$18.5M versus our estimate of CA$18.2M. The higher-than-expected revenue can be primarily attributed to the higher-than-expected average realized price of silver and gold. . .the company reported an impressive performance on the cost front as both the cash cost and all-in sustaining cost of US$4.20/oz and US$9.25/oz were significantly below our estimate of US$6.76/oz and US$14.40/oz, respectively. . .we are reiterating our Buy rating on the stock."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s mine operating performance in Q1/16 delivered both production of 1 Moz Aq eq and cash costs of just $4.20/ounce, beating our previously lowered consolidated cash cost estimate of $6.50/oz and well below management guidance of $5.00�7.00/oz. . .costs continue to trend lower across Great Panther's asset base, particularly at the Guanajuato Mine Complex due to sustained higher gold grades at San Ignacio. In the wake of gold grades reaching 2.58 g/t at the GMC during Q1/16, we are increasing our average gold grade across the mine to 2.4 g/t from 2.1 g/t."
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with Brien Lundin 

(5/3/16)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. is up 505% since we recommended it in January. . .it grew its production by about 30% last year. This is a year where it is consolidating that production, but that additional production is also going to significantly leverage the company as metals prices rise. So I really like Great Panther. President and CEO Bob Archer has done a wonderful job of growing that company over the past 10 or so years. It's in the absolute sweet spot for rising metals prices right now, and it's always on the lookout for new projects and new mines to acquire. I don't think it's going to be limited to silver going forward; its recent production actually had a growing gold component to it. So it benefitted initially from the rise in gold, and it will also benefit from the rise in silver prices. . .as a producer, increases in gold and silver will have a dramatic and immediate effect on it value, going straight to the bottom line."

In our view, the firm's strong balance sheet should enable it to continue its exploration efforts at the Guanajuato mine complex, Guadalupe de lso Reyes and the Coricancha mine."

(11/6/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported its Q3/15 results with an adjusted earnings per share of CA$(0.02), in-line with our estimates. . .primarily due to cost reductions, which offset the lower realized silver price. In addition, the appreciated U.S. dollar against both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar contributed to the lower operating costs and higher revenue figures, respectively. . .we believe that the company's stock would be a name to long as the precious metals market turns around."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported yet another solid quarter, with both cash cost and all-in sustaining cost (AISC) exceeding our estimate by decent margins. Despite depressed metal prices, which impacted the company's top line, increased production, higher ore grades and strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Mexican peso allowed cash cost and AISC to average $6.50/oz and $13.08/oz, respectively. . .we expect Q4/15 cash cost and AISC to be slightly higher than in Q3/15 and to average $6.47/oz and $14.82/oz, respectively."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported Q3/15 results. . .revenue of CA$16.8M was below our estimate of CA$20.6M, while loss per share of CA$(0.02) was in-line with our estimate of CA$(0.02). . .cash cost and all-in sustaining cost (AISC) continue to trend lower. Cash cost of $6.50/oz was significantly below our estimate of $12.05/oz. Additionally, the cash cost declined on a quarter-over-quarter basis from $6.63/oz in Q2/15. . .AISC of $13.08/oz was significantly lower than our estimate of $18.81/oz."

		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported its Q3/15 production results of 587 Koz silver and 6.1 Koz gold on a consolidated basis. Silver production was in-line with our estimates, whereas gold production beat our forecasts. . .management expects to exceed its already-increased production guidance of 3.8�3.9 Moz Ag eq, which will be driven by the increased production from San Ignacio. . .management expects to commence a 2,200m surface drill program at San Ignacio to test the strike extension with step-out drills and to upgrade the mineral resources with infill drilling."
		
		









  
      Bhakti Pavani, Euro Pacific Canada
  

(10/15/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. reported Q3/15 production of 1,080,296 oz Ag eq, well above our estimate of 939,153 oz Ag eq, primarily due to higher mill feed and gold grades at Guanajuato mine complex. . .the company increased its 2015 production guidance from 3.1 Moz Ag eq to 3.8�3.9 Moz Ag eq at the end of Q2/15, but with the record production of ~1.1 Moz Ag eq in Q3/15, we believe the company is on its way to exceed the top end of its guidance range of ~3.9 Moz Ag eq." 
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(10/15/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s third quarter gold production reached 6,079 oz�a record quarterly figure for the company. In our view, the increase in gold production stems primarily from management's successful ramp-up at San Ignacio, which has not only become a large part of the overall production mix but has continued to show increasing gold grades."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(9/11/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s Q2/15 revenue was up 33%, due both to increased production and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. . .the company has increased its full year 2015 production guidance by 8% (from 3.5�3.6 Moz silver equivalent to 3.8�3.9 Moz silver equivalent). . .it posted a 56% decrease in average cash costs in Q2/15."
		
		









  Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial) 

(8/27/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. had adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization deductions of CA$4.2M in Q2/15, compared to CA$0.2M in Q2/14. Moreover, revenue was up 33%, due to both increased production and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. . .the company posted a 56% year-over-year decrease in average cash costs in Q2/15. . .its successes on the production and cost containment fronts give me hope that its financials will bounce back in the latter two quarters of the year. We'll add the stock back to our Buy list."
		
		









The  Gold Report Interview with Brien Lundin 

(8/27/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s latest quarterly results are amazing. The company generated higher production levels and lower cash costs despite a stronger U.S. dollar. Production was up over 50%. All-in sustaining costs dropped about 50%. I was very pleased with the numbers that Great Panther was able to deliver. It is making money on every ounce of silver it produces, although it did report a net loss due to currency exchange issues. So I'm positive going forward."

The  Gold Report Interview with Florian Siegfried 

(8/17/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd.'s stock has suffered lately after some exchange-traded funds sold their positions. But it made two acquisitions over the last few months that are interesting. It bought an option on the Coricancha polymetallic gold-silver-zinc deposit in Peru from Nyrstar. If it wants to execute its option to buy the whole project, including the infrastructure, mill, everything on site, the price would be around US$18M. It has a 124 Moz silver equivalent Inferred resource and 22 Moz silver equivalent Measured and Indicated resource. So it's a big resource. Great Panther is reviewing the mine plan to see if it can find cost efficiencies. Then it will decide if it wants to execute on the option. I think that's smart. Great Panther is a stock to watch."

      Jay Taylor, Gold, Energy & Tech Stocks
(8/12/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. is a Mexican silver producer poised for substantial growth. . .it is also venturing toward gold production, having acquired Cangold Limited. . .overall, the company remains a growing silver producer, and that should be good news for shareholders, because when the bull market in precious metals resumes�when precious metals prices are rising�silver usually outperforms gold."
		
		












  
      Christopher Ecclestone, Hallgarten & Co.
  

(8/12/15)

		
		"As a pure silver play during the great silver boom, we found Great Panther Silver Ltd. to be worthy but not outstanding. . .it is probably because the company already has a zinc/lead component in its income mix through the Topia mine that it has decided to be a 'first-mover' in the space with its opportunistic purchase (or more accurately, optioning) of Nyrstar's Coricancha lead/zinc/silver complex in Peru. In one step it rebalances future production more toward base metals and diversifies Great Panther away from its traditional stamping ground of Mexico."
		
		









  
      Bhakti Pavani, Euro Pacific Canada
  

(8/7/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. produced a record 1 Moz silver equivalent in Q2/15. . .the company's revenue of CA$19.2M increased 32% on a year-over-year basis from CA$14.5M in Q2/14. . .Great Panther reported grades of silver and gold at Guanajuato mine complex of 233 g/t and 2.42 g/t, vs. our estimate of 177 g/t and 1.92 g/t, respectively. In addition to the robust product, the company significantly benefited from the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the U.S. dollar and higher ore grades, which led to a significantly lower cash cost and all-in sustaining cost."
		
		












  
      Ash Guglani, Salman Partners
  

(8/7/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. amended its production and costs guidance due to its better than expected results in H1/15. . .the weakening Mexican peso, as well as its improved operational efficiency, has helped the company maintain its solid financial position. . .Great Panther is also on track to grow its resource base through acquisitions and options despite the challenging commodity price environment."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(8/7/15)

		
		"On August 5 Great Panther Silver Ltd. announced Q2/15 results. . .the company produced 1.09 Moz silver equivalent, consisting of 648,810 oz silver and 5,322 oz gold. . .cash costs decreased by 56% compared with Q2/14 to a total of $6.63/oz payable silver. Further, all-in sustaining cost decreased by 49% to $12.54/oz. . .while the silver environment remains challenging, we highlight that management is undertaking the right steps to keep Great Panther producing at lowered costs. . .we maintain our Buy recommendation and $1.10 price target on the company's stock."
		
		












  
      Ash Guglani, Salman Partners
  

(8/6/15)

		
		"Great Panther Silver Ltd. yesterday released its Q2/15 results with net earnings of CA$0.03/share. . .at the end of Q2/15, the company's working capital position was CA$33.9M, including cash and cash equivalents of CA$19.4M."

(7/30/15)

		
		"In the face of a difficult market, Great Panther Silver Ltd. has turned in strong operational numbers for Q2/15. . .with the strong quarter, management has increased its full-year production guidance from a  range of 3.5�3.6 Moz silver equivalent to 3.8�3.9 Moz silver equivalent."

Is Great Panther Silver Ltd’s Slumping Production a Concern?
The junior silver miner reported a double-digit decline in precious metal production during the third quarter.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Oct 14, 2016 at 9:45AM

Great Panther Silver (NYSEMKT:GPL) was one of several silver mining stocks that reported third-quarter production this week. Unfortunately, its numbers were a bit of a disappointment after consolidated production dropped by 12% to 953,632 silver equivalent ounces. Given where precious metal prices spent most of the quarter, that decline could not have come at a worse time for the company. 
Digging into the numbers
Great Panther Silver currently owns and operates two silver mining operations in Mexico. That is a tiny portfolio compared to rival miners, such as silver industry giant Silver Wheaton (NYSE:SLW), for example, which currently receives production from 22 operating mines. Because of its small size, minor issues can have a much larger impact on Great Panther Silver's production. That was certainly the case during the third quarter when two temporary shutdowns related to worker deaths affected output. 
In addition to these closures, lower ore grades also hurt production. As a result, the company's silver production dropped 13% year over year to 510,491 ounces, while gold production declined by 11% to 5,423 ounces. Something similar happened last quarter when silver production fell 17% because the output from the San Ignacio mine had a higher gold-to-silver ratio, resulting in gold production's increasing 13% while silver equivalent production declined by 5%. 
Instability at the wrong time
While Great Panther Silver does not expect its third-quarter production challenges to affect its ability to meet production guidance for 2016, it still could have an impact on the company. That is because the third quarter was a particularly lucrative one for precious metal prices. As the chart below shows, silver and gold prices were at their highest average price during the quarter:

New York Silver Price data by YCharts.
Because of that, the company could have made more money if it had been able to maintain production, while growth could have caused profits to surge. That is the likely fate of fellow Mexico-focused silver miner First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG) after it set a new record for silver production during the third quarter, producing a total of 4.5 million ounces of silver equivalent from its six operating mines. First Majestic Silver said that it produced 3.1 million ounces of silver during the quarter, which was not only up 20% year over year but rose 9% from the second quarter, meaning that incremental production came online at the perfect time. Given the simultaneous increases in First Majestic Silver's production and precious metal prices, the company's upcoming third-quarter earnings report should be good. 
Silver Wheaton is also on pace to deliver strong production and profit growth in the third quarter after it recently boosted its stake in the Salobo mine, which gives it another 25% of the life-of-mine gold production. During the second quarter, increasing gold production from Salobo was one reason why Silver Wheaton's gold production jumped 40% year over year, which helped drive its cash flow up by 23%. Overall, Silver Wheaton's larger scale and diversification proved invaluable during the second quarter when it was able to more than offset significantly lower production at the Penasquito mine, which suffered from lower ore grades, a planned maintenance shutdown, and several start-up issues. 





Investor takeaway
Great Panther Silver faced several production challenges in the third quarter, resulting in a double-digit dip in its output. That drop came at a bad time because silver and gold prices were riding high during the quarter, which will likely be reflected in the company's upcoming earnings report. Furthermore, the report highlighted one of the big risks of investing in a smaller mining company, which is that relatively minor operational issues can still have a significant impact on results.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
