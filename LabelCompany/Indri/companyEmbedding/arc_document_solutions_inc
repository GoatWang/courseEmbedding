Management Commentary
"Despite continuing drops in our traditional business, our new services continue to grow, led by year-over-year growth of nine percent in archiving and information management," said K. "Suri" Suriyakumar, Chairman, President and CEO of ARC Document Solutions. "While our technology services have yet to offset declines related to printing services, our cash position remains strong as evidenced by our continuing ability to repurchase our shares and reduce our senior debt. Our capital structure is excellent, and we are confident in our ability to keep the company stable and productive during this transition."
"The type of transition ARC is going through is a tough one. The result is that we are changing at every level -- sales, operations, technology, and finance -- to balance the future needs of the market against what customers need today," Mr. Suriyakumar continued. "This is especially true given that the construction industry is slow in adopting technology. It is why I have emphasized in my previous discussions that we require 24 to 36 months to get on top of this transition."
"The company remains on sound financial footing while we work our way through the difficult sales comparison to last year," said Jorge Avalos, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Document Solutions. "Cash flow from operations is on par with last year's performance, the leverage ratio on our senior debt is below 2.5 times, and we continue to repurchase shares, all of which demonstrates our continuing focus on cash generation, debt pay-down, and returning value to our shareholders."
2016 Second Quarter Supplemental Information:
Net sales were $103.8 million, an 8.5% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Days sales outstanding in Q2 2016 were 53, compared to 54 days in Q2 2015. 
Architectural, engineering, construction and building owner/operators (AEC/O) customers comprised approximately 77% of our total net sales, while customers outside of construction made up approximately 23% of our total net sales.
Total number of MPS locations at the end of the second quarter has grown to approximately 9,240, a gain of 520 locations over Q2 2015. This information reflects the reduction of approximately 200 locations associated with a large client that did not renew their MPS engagement with us at the end of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairment, the impact of trade secret litigation costs, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring expense.

(1) On February 1, 2013, we filed a civil complaint against a competitor and a former employee in the Superior Court of California for Orange County, which alleged, among other claims, the misappropriation of ARC trade secrets; namely, proprietary customer lists that were used to communicate with ARC customers in an attempt to unfairly acquire their business. In prior litigation with the competitor based on related facts, in 2007 the competitor entered into a settlement agreement and stipulated judgment, which included an injunction. We instituted this suit to stop the defendant from using similar unfair business practices against us in the Southern California market. The case proceeded to trial in May 2014, and a jury verdict was entered for the defendants. In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a settlement and paid the defendant. Legal fees associated with the litigation were recorded as selling, general and administrative expense.
(2) In October 2012, we initiated a restructuring plan which included the closure or downsizing of the Company's service center locations, as well as a reduction in headcount. Restructuring expenses in 2016 and 2015 primarily consist of revised estimated lease termination and obligation costs resulting from facilities closed in 2013.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
EBITDA and related ratios presented in this report are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing EBITDA by net sales. 
We have presented EBITDA and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity. We believe investors may also find these measures meaningful, given how our management makes use of them. The following is a discussion of our use of these measures. 
We use EBITDA to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments. Our operating segments' financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for U.S. operating segments. We use EBITDA to compare the performance of our operating segments and to measure performance for determining consolidated-level compensation. In addition, we use EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures. 
EBITDA and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:

They do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments;
            
They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
            
They do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
            
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
            
Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 

Because of these limitations, EBITDA, and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and related ratios only as supplements. 
Our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA over certain periods is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors. The unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances. Comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict GAAP presentation. Each non-GAAP presentation, however, is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above. 
Specifically, we have presented adjusted net income attributable to ARC and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ARC shareholders for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairment, restructuring expense, trade secret litigation costs, and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items. This presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. We believe these charges were the result of the then current macroeconomic environment, our capital restructuring, or other items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance. 
We have presented adjusted EBITDA in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairment, trade secret litigation costs, restructuring expense and stock-based compensation expense. The adjustment of EBITDA for these items is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA in our credit agreement; therefore, we believe this information is useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.

Management Commentary
"In 2015 we carved out a solid position for our new technology solutions, generated more than a million dollars of new sales from innovative technology-enabled services, and drove impressive growth in our Archiving and Information Management business," said K. "Suri" Suriyakumar, Chairman, President and CEO of ARC Document Solutions. "Our team also generated a consolidated gross margin of nearly 35 percent, paid down more than 10 percent of our senior debt obligations, generated strong cash flows and healthy EBITDA performance, and created the opportunity to produce strong returns on a share repurchase program. All of this was done in the face of our traditional business being challenged due to secular headwinds and a continuing industry trend toward reducing print."
"As we look at the next 24 to 36 months," said Mr. Suriyakumar, "we expect to deliver excellent cash generation, healthy gross margin performance, and continuing improvements to our capital structure as we capture new business, gain traction with our new business lines, and build upon them to offset the slow declines in our traditional business. We're building a new business, and as we do so, we believe our investors will recognize the fundamental value of our transformation."
2015 Fourth Quarter Supplemental Information:
Net sales were $104.5 million, a 2.8% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Days sales outstanding in Q4 2015 and 2014 were 52. 
AEC customers comprised approximately 77% of our total net sales, while non-AEC customers made up 23% of our total net sales.
The number of MPS accounts has grown to approximately 9,000, a gain of approximately 500 contracts over Q4 2014.

(1)
On February 1, 2013, we filed a civil complaint against a competitor and a former employee in the Superior Court of California for Orange County, which alleged, among other claims, the misappropriation of ARC trade secrets; namely, proprietary customer lists that were used to communicate with ARC customers in an attempt to unfairly acquire their business. In prior litigation with the competitor based on related facts, in 2007 the competitor entered into a settlement agreement and stipulated judgment, which included an injunction. We instituted this suit to stop the defendant from using similar unfair business practices against us in the Southern California market. The case proceeded to trial in May 2014, and a jury verdict was entered for the defendants. In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a settlement and paid the defendant. Legal fees associated with the litigation were recorded as selling, general and administrative expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
EBIT, EBITDA and related ratios presented in this report are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
EBIT represents net income before interest and taxes. EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBIT margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing EBITDA by net sales. 
We have presented EBIT, EBITDA and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity. We believe investors may also find these measures meaningful, given how our management makes use of them. The following is a discussion of our use of these measures. 
We use EBIT and EBITDA to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments. Our operating segments' financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for U.S. operating segments. As a result, we believe EBIT is the best measure of operating segment profitability and the most useful metric by which to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments. We use EBITDA to measure performance for determining consolidated-level compensation. In addition, we use EBIT and EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures. 
EBIT, EBITDA and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:

They do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments; 


They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 


They do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 


Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 


Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 

Because of these limitations, EBIT, EBITDA, and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBIT, EBITDA and related ratios only as supplements. 
Our presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted cash flows from operations over certain periods is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors. The unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances. Comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict GAAP presentation. Each non-GAAP presentation, however, is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above. For more information, see our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Specifically, we have presented adjusted net income attributable to ARC and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ARC shareholders for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring expense, trade secret litigation costs, and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items. We have presented adjusted cash flows from operating activities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to reflect the exclusion of cash payments related to trade secret litigation costs and cash payments related to restructuring expenses. This presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We believe these charges were the result of the current macroeconomic environment, our capital restructuring, or other items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance. 
We have presented adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, trade secret litigation costs, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring expense. The adjustment of EBITDA for these items is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA in our credit agreement; therefore, we believe this information is useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.

Management Commentary
"As we stated earlier in the year, our transformation effort is progressing," said K. "Suri" Suriyakumar, Chairman, CEO and President of ARC Document Solutions. "We continue to protect our print revenues while working to accelerate our sales in technology services. We expect these efforts will continue throughout the year. Despite the disruptions caused by our sales team reconfiguration that started in the second half of last year, and shrinking print volumes, we generated strong cash flows and accelerated the reduction of our senior debt."
"We are maintaining our forecast for 2017, continuing to take into account that the first half of the year will likely remain muted and prudent investments in both print and technology are necessary to drive new growth. Stability in cash generation remains a priority, and the company's financial health remains sound. We are very confident that our strong cash flows and conservative capital structure will sustain us through our transition," Mr. Suriyakumar said.
"Sales performance during the period was similar to what we generated in 2016, but we increased cash flows from operations by $1.6 million on a year-over-year basis," said Jorge Avalos, Chief Financial Officer of ARC Document Solutions. "As such, we used $7 million in excess cash to reduce our senior debt and maintain a healthy leverage ratio of 2.5x. As previously noted, I expect our cash generation performance to remain strong for the remainder of the year."
2017 First Quarter Supplemental Information:
Net sales were $98.7 million, a 4.7% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. 
Days sales outstanding in Q1 2017 were 54, compared to 53 days in Q1 2016.
Architectural, engineering, construction and building owner/operators (AEC/O) customers comprised approximately 78% of our total net sales, while customers outside of construction made up approximately 22% of our total net sales.
Total number of MPS locations at the end of the first quarter has grown to approximately 9,680, a net gain of approximately 630 locations over Q1 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring expense.

 (1) In October 2012, we initiated a restructuring plan which included the closure or downsizing of the Company's service center locations, as well as a reduction in headcount. Restructuring expenses in 2016 primarily consist of revised estimated lease termination and obligation costs resulting from facilities closed in 2013.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA and related ratios presented in this report are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity.
EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing EBITDA by net sales.
We have presented EBITDA and related ratios because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and liquidity. We believe investors may also find these measures meaningful, given how our management makes use of them. The following is a discussion of our use of these measures.
We use EBITDA to measure and compare the performance of our operating segments. Our operating segments' financial performance includes all of the operating activities except debt and taxation which are managed at the corporate level for U.S. operating segments. We use EBITDA to compare the performance of our operating segments and to measure performance for determining consolidated-level compensation. In addition, we use EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions and potential capital expenditures.
EBITDA and related ratios have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:

They do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures and contractual commitments; 
They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
They do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in business growth or to reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and related ratios only as supplements.
Our presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA over certain periods is an attempt to provide meaningful comparisons to our historical performance for our existing and future investors. The unprecedented changes in our end markets over the past several years have required us to take measures that are unique in our history and specific to individual circumstances. Comparisons inclusive of these actions make normal financial and other performance patterns difficult to discern under a strict GAAP presentation. Each non-GAAP presentation, however, is explained in detail in the reconciliation tables above.
Specifically, we have presented adjusted net income attributable to ARC and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ARC shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 to reflect the exclusion of loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring expense, and changes in the valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets and other discrete tax items. This presentation facilitates a meaningful comparison of our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. We believe these charges were the result of the then current macroeconomic environment, our capital restructuring, or other items which are not indicative of our actual operating performance.
We have presented adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, restructuring expense and stock-based compensation expense. The adjustment of EBITDA for these items is consistent with the definition of adjusted EBITDA in our credit agreement; therefore, we believe this information is useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

ARC Document Solutions, Inc. (formerly American Reprographics Company) headquartered in Walnut Creek, CA, is a publicly traded company that provides specialized document solutions to businesses of all types, with an emphasis on the non-residential segment of the architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”) industry.
The company provides onsite managed print services (MPS), archiving and information management (AIM), construction document and information management (CDIM), as well as the sale of technology applications to support these services to more than 90,000 customers. The company operates approximately 170 service centers throughout North America, provides its equipment and services onsite in more than 9,400 customer locations, and services its large enterprise customers with a corporate sales force called Global Solutions.[1]
Fiscal 2017 revenue was $406 million.[2] The company began as a $9 million stand-alone reprographics provider in Southern California in the late 1980s. It has grown to its present size and geographic coverage through the acquisition of more than 140 other companies. It remains the largest company of its kind in the U.S. with more than 2,500 employees. The company has received recognition from Forbes magazine (as one of its “Best 200 Small Companies”), Gartner, MPSA, BERTL, and Océ.

History[edit]
The company began in 1988 as Micro Device, dba “Ford Graphics,” a $9 million, privately held Los Angeles-based reprographics company, acquired and managed by ARC’s two founders, current Chairman, President and CEO, K. “Suri” Suriyakumar, and S. “Mohan” Chandramohan. Following four acquisitions in California, the company was organized as“American Reprographics Company, L.L.C.,” a California Limited Liability Corporation, in 1997. Acquired operations generally maintained their original brands in the marketplace to retain local recognition.[3]
Following additional acquisitions that expanded the company’s geographical reach into major metropolitan markets in a majority of U.S. states, American Reprographics L.L.C. made its initial public offering in February of 2005 and was subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “ARP.”
Concurrent with the consolidation of its local brands in January 2010, the company’s ticker symbol was changed to “ARC.” The Delaware corporation name was formally changed to “ARC Document Solutions” in 2012.[4]

ARC Document Solutions, Inc. (formerly American Reprographics Company) headquartered in Walnut Creek, CA, is a publicly traded company that provides specialized document solutions to businesses of all types, with an emphasis on the non-residential segment of the architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”) industry.
The company provides onsite managed print services (MPS), archiving and information management (AIM), construction document and information management (CDIM), as well as the sale of technology applications to support these services to more than 90,000 customers. The company operates approximately 170 service centers throughout North America, provides its equipment and services onsite in more than 9,400 customer locations, and services its large enterprise customers with a corporate sales force called Global Solutions.[1]
Fiscal 2017 revenue was $406 million.[2] The company began as a $9 million stand-alone reprographics provider in Southern California in the late 1980s. It has grown to its present size and geographic coverage through the acquisition of more than 140 other companies. It remains the largest company of its kind in the U.S. with more than 2,500 employees. The company has received recognition from Forbes magazine (as one of its “Best 200 Small Companies”), Gartner, MPSA, BERTL, and Océ.

History[edit]
The company began in 1988 as Micro Device, dba “Ford Graphics,” a $9 million, privately held Los Angeles-based reprographics company, acquired and managed by ARC’s two founders, current Chairman, President and CEO, K. “Suri” Suriyakumar, and S. “Mohan” Chandramohan. Following four acquisitions in California, the company was organized as“American Reprographics Company, L.L.C.,” a California Limited Liability Corporation, in 1997. Acquired operations generally maintained their original brands in the marketplace to retain local recognition.[3]
Following additional acquisitions that expanded the company’s geographical reach into major metropolitan markets in a majority of U.S. states, American Reprographics L.L.C. made its initial public offering in February of 2005 and was subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “ARP.”
Concurrent with the consolidation of its local brands in January 2010, the company’s ticker symbol was changed to “ARC.” The Delaware corporation name was formally changed to “ARC Document Solutions” in 2012.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
