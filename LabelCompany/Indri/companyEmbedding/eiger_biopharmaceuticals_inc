			Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)		


eigerbioadmin 


			2017-02-06T20:44:59+00:00		



Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious condition in which the pressure in a patient’s pulmonary arteries becomes dangerously high. PAH begins when tiny arteries in the lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, become narrowed, blocked or destroyed.  This makes it harder for blood to flow through the lungs, and raises pressure within the arteries in the lungs.  As the pressure builds, the heart’s lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through the lungs, eventually causing the heart muscle to weaken and eventually fail.

PAH is an orphan indication, affecting 15 – 50 individuals/million in the US and Europe. Although management of PAH has improved significantly in the past 15 years, the mortality rate is still unacceptably high, with a 5-year survival rate of 60%.
The exact cause of PAH is not known; it may be idiopathic, and also may occur in the setting of other diseases such as connective tissue disease, or be hereditary.  Studies suggest that inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of PAH in some patients.  The lowest survival is seen in patients with immune-dysregulated/connective tissue associated PAH (CTD-PAH). Even patients achieving prolonged survival suffer significant morbidity and poor quality of life.  PAH is a progressive, life-threatening illness and potentially eligible for Orphan Designation in the US, EU, and Japan.
Currently approved therapies for the treatment of PAH include those acting on the nitric oxide pathway (PDE5 inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulator), the endothelin pathway (endothelin receptor antagonists), or prostacyclins.  These drugs target vasoconstriction.  While the development of these newer drugs has resulted in improvements in survival, they are palliative and do not address the inflammatory component of PAH.  PAH remains a progressive and life-threatening disease with an unmet medical need.
Pathogenesis of PAHResearchers in Mark Nicoll’s laboratory at Stanford University have identified an inflammatory mediator, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), that has been identified in both animal models of PAH as well as human PAH.  A prominent pathological feature of PAH is accumulation of macrophages near the arterioles of the lung, and in both clinical PAH tissue and rat models of PAH, it has been demonstrated that the accumulated macrophages express high levels of LTA4H, the biosynthetic enzyme for LTB4.   Moreover, macrophage-derived LTB4 directly induces apoptosis in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) and induces proliferation and hypertrophy of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, both of which contributes to occlusion of the lumen and PAH.  Inhibition of LTB4 production, by inhibition of LTA4 hydrolase, had a very positive effect on both pressures as well as survival in animal models of PAH (Tian, W. et al., Sci Transl Med, 2013; 5: 1-14).
Eiger Bio has an exclusive license to this technology for targeting effects of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to modulate inflammation and immune response in the lung, providing a potential preventative and therapeutic approach for treating PAH.  The technology was invented in the laboratory of Mark Nicolls, MD, Chief of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Stanford University.

Eiger Biopharmaceuticals: Can This $10 Biotech Stock Continue To Rally? - Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:EIGR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Eiger Biopharmaceuticals: Can This $10 Biotech Stock Continue To Rally?Jul.18.17 | About: Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, (EIGR) Bret Jensen Specializing in biotech stocks, Small Caps, managing optimized portfoliosMarketplaceThe Biotech ForumSummarySmall-cap biotech concern Eiger Biopharmaceuticals soared 25% in trading Friday triggered by strong analyst support.Can this multiple "shots on goal" busted IPO maintain its recent momentum?We take a deeper look at Eiger's pipeline and prospects below."A bruise is a lesson ... and each lesson makes us better." - George R.R. Martin, Game of Thrones 

 In early June I issued exclusive analysis on Eiger BioPharmaceuticals (EIGR). The stock rallied strongly in trading last Friday, at one point being up over 30% for the day. It finished the day with just under a 25% gain. 

The trigger was BTIG issuing a Buy rating with a whopping $32 price target, which would make Eiger better than a four-bagger. A month ago, Oppenheimer reiterated an even more optimistic $34 price target which came out after my exclusive analysis. Given this sudden analyst interest in this speculative Tier 4 concern, I am republishing this analysis for the regular SeekingAlpha community who may be looking for a new name to add a small stake in within a well-diversified biotech portfolio. Previous Analysis We take a look at a small biotech concern that appears to have an asymmetrical risk/reward profile at anything less than $8.00 a share or so. It is worthy of a small stake within a well-diversified biotech portfolio for risk-tolerant investors. Company Overview Eiger BioPharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:EIGR) is a Palo Alto, Calif.-based clinical stage concern specializing in the treatment of orphan (or rare) diseases. The company completed a reverse shell merger with failed biotech Celladon Corporation on March 22, 2016, in which $39.5 million of gross proceeds were raised. The company currently has five Phase 2 candidates being investigated for the treatment of four orphan diseases. As can be seen below, the company did not reward its previous shareholders. However, if it delivers on its pipeline that could very well change in the years ahead.
 

 Pipeline 1. Lonafarnib (LNF). This oral therapy in-licensed from Merck (NYSE:MRK) is being investigated for the treatment of HDV, the most severe form of hepatitis. HDV is embedded in the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and infects ~5% of HBV sufferers worldwide, although that figure fluctuates greatly dependent on geography, with a low incidence in the United States and Europe and much higher incidences in South America and Central Asia. HBV patients who are co-infected with the HDV virus are more than four times as likely to contract cirrhosis in 5 to 10 years and have less than half the survival rate versus those who aren't co-infected with HDV. There is presently no approved treatment for hepatitis delta infection, although PEGylated-interferon-alfa (PEG-IFN-alfa) has demonstrated modest efficacy at the cost of side-effects. The company believes that 100,000 patients suffer from HDV in the United States; however, only about a third of that number is currently diagnosed. Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation step (the addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein) of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the virus life cycle at the stage of assembly. Eiger is conducting six different Phase 2 studies on lonafarnib comprising over 100 patients in combination with ritonavir (RTV) and/or PEG-INF-alfa in Turkey, Germany, Mongolia, and the United States. Three of these trials have completed including a proof of concept (POC) study in the U.S. as well as the LOWR HDV-3 (U.S.) and LOWR HDV-4 (Germany). LOWR HDV-1 and 2 (Turkey) are nearing completion, with LOWR HDV-5 (Mongolia) expected to enroll in 2017. The bottom line is that LNF has demonstrated therapeutic value. In a recent presentation to the International Liver Conference in Amsterdam the company stated that after 24 weeks of treatment with LNF 25 mg or 50 mg twice daily plus RTV, the level of HDV-RNA was below the limit of quantitation in 36% (n=5/14) of patients while 60% achieved normalization of the liver enzyme ALT, a biomarker for liver damage. When taken in combination with PEG-IFN-alfa, LNF 25mg plus RTV revealed levels of HDV-RNA below the limit of quantitation in 80% (n=4/5) of patients with ALT normalization achieved in 78% (n=7/9) of the patients where PEG-INF-alfa was part of the regimen.
 In patients treated for 48 weeks with the triple therapy of PEG-IFN-alfa + LNF 25 mg BID + RTV, PCR-negativity (i.e. no RNA replication) was achieved in 67% (n=2/3) of patients at the end of treatment. Adverse events (AES) were mild to moderate GI events. These are significant results for an orphan disease with no approved remedies. Eiger is expected to huddle with the FDA for next steps in 4Q17. LNF for the treatment of HDV infection has been granted orphan drug designation in Europe and the United States, and LNF in combination with RTV has been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of chronic HDV infections. Privately held Replicor, Inc. has also demonstrated success in the care of HDV with a complete absence of HDV-RNA at 24 weeks after treatment in 7 of 12 patients in its Phase 2 trial. 2. Lambda Interferon. Lambda is a first in class type III interferon (IFN) that Eiger in-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) in April 2016, also being evaluated for the treatment of HDV infection. Lambda stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. It targets a different set of receptors (liver cells) than type I PEG-INF-alfa (blood and central nervous systems cells), which has been able to clear HDV infections in 25% to 33% of patients with 48 weeks to two years of treatment. However, PEG-INF-alfa's success has been offset by many AEs. In a study released in 2016, lambda was generally much better tolerated than PEG-INF-alfa. A Phase 2 trial (LIMT HDV) to evaluate lambda's effectiveness, tolerability, and safety has recently dosed its first patient. The study will involve approximately 30 patients in Israel, New Zealand, and Pakistan and will include 48 weeks of treatment followed by 24 weeks of off treatment observation. It is Eiger's hope that this therapy can replace PEG-INF-alfa. 3. Exendin 9-39. Exendin, the company's second most developed candidate, is being examined in the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). An increasing side-effect of gastric bypass surgery and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (stomach reduction) is severely low glucose concentrations and spikes in insulin, resulting in seizures, loss of consciousness, cognitive dysfunction, and death. Approximately 300,000 of these surgeries are performed in the United States and Europe annually, with ~30% being of the gastric bypass variety. In the U.S. about 3,000 new patients present annually with 30,000 current patients. There is no approved regimen for PBH.
 Exendin 9-39 is a 31 amino acid fragment of exenatide, commercially known as Byetta and currently employed in the treatment of type-2 diabetes. In a Phase 2 POC trial encompassing eight patients, who were administered a single ascending dose, nadir glucose levels increased by an average of 61% with none of the patients experiencing hypoglycemia post-meal. Another Phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple ascending doses of subcutaneously administered exendin 9-39 in patients with PBH. Of the 11 patients receiving treatment, all dose levels raised nadir glucose levels, but doses below 0.2mg/kg required IV dextrose rescue. Also, peak insulin levels dropped by an average of 51%. Exendin 9-39 has received orphan designation for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia from the FDA and EMA. Additionally, Eiger has developed a novel subcutaneous liquid formulation that will be tested on healthy patients in 3Q17 and PBH patients in 4Q17. XOMA Corporation (NASDAQ:XOMA) embarked on and successfully completed a Phase 2 POC trial for its drug XOMA 358 for the treatment of PBH. Results were not on an apple-to-apples basis with Eiger's trials, so analysis is a bit of a minefield. In its 9mg/kg cohort (6 patients), average nighttime glucose levels improved 15% in days 3-6 after treatment versus baseline. On the surface, Exendin 9-39 appears to have the upper hand. 4. Ubenimex for PAH. Ubenimex is an oral therapy for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). It was licensed from Nippon Kayaku (OTCPK:NPKYY), which has been marketing this compound for another indication for 25 years. PAH is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart, eventually causing the heart muscle to weaken and fail from overwork. In an animal study involving twelve PAH rats, all six who received ubenimex lived to at least 35 days. By contrast, all six rats not receiving ubenimex died by the 35th day. Also, severe right ventricle systolic pressure returned to normalized levels by the 14th day in the treated animals. Since the safety of the drug is already well understood, Eiger is going straight into a Phase 2 trial with a 45 patient study to test for pulmonary vascular resistance in combination with the current standard of care. Enrollment is expected to be completed in 2Q17 with data expected in 1Q18. Ubenimex has received orphan drug designations from both the FDA and EMA.
 The company may face competition from Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RETA), which is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 study with data expected in 1H18, and Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARNA), which has completed enrollment for a Phase 2 trial. 5. Ubenimex for Lymphedema. Lymphedema is the buildup of body fluids in soft body tissues when the lymphatic system is compromised. It is characterized by abnormal swelling and thickening of the skin in affected areas. There are no approved pharmacological treatments for lymphedema. In animal models, ubenimex reversed lymphedema-induced tissue remodeling and skin thickness in the affected areas. A Phase 2 study is expected to complete enrollment in 3Q17 with data readout expected in 2Q18. The primary endpoint is a reduction in skin thickness with secondary endpoint being a reduction in limb volume. The company expects to, but has not yet received, orphan status for ubenimex in the treatment of lymphedema. Novartis (NYSE:NVS) (Phase 2) is also working on a therapy in this space. Balance Sheet and Analyst Commentary Eiger exited 2016 with ~$60 million, which the company believes will take it to mid-2018. They have drawn $15 million on a $25 million loan and security agreement, of which $3.1 million of principle and interest is due in 2018. Three analysts follow shares of EIGR with two recommending a buy and one rating the shares outperform. Twelve-month price targets are $28, $34, and $36 respectfully. The median of which represents an eye-popping over 300% return from the current share price. Outlook The story of Eiger is that of the busted IPO, with shares trading around $17 at the time of the reverse shell merger in late March, and then moving above the $23 level during 2Q16, only to steadily reverse course to its current level below $8 a share. If Eiger were to pay off every liability on its balance sheet it would still have ~$5 a share in cash. Ultimately, clinical-stage biotech companies are about getting candidates to market. The bear case would state that Eiger still has many hurdles still to jump before achieving LNF commercialization, and if it gets there it will owe Merck $27 million in potential milestone payments plus mid-single digit to low-double digit royalties. Potential competition not only from other HDV candidates, but also from HBV candidates could prove more effective than LNF. Rivals also loom for all of its other would-be therapies in the orphan space, and the company is more than likely going to revisit the capital markets before it is generating revenue.
 However, with a likely high five-figure or low six-figure price tag on LNF because of its orphan status in a completely vacant space and a pipeline of other Phase 2 candidates that show promise in mostly unserved areas, the upside for Eiger is significant. With plenty of upcoming catalysts (including 4Q17 FDA meeting on LNF next steps) and with cash less long-term debt at around 65% of the company's current market cap, anything at or below $8.00 a share is a good spot to initiate a position in Eiger.

Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. Reports Additional Positive Phase 2 Results from Multiple-Ascending Dose Study of Exendin 9-39 in Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia Patients
Jun 12 17
Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the positive data from the Phase 2 multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study evaluating subcutaneous (SC) exendin 9-39 in post-bariatric surgical patients who experience dangerously low, postprandial (after meal) blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) known as post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). A liquid and a lyophilized formulation of SC exendin 9-39 were evaluated in the MAD study. Data were presented from patients dosed with a lyophilized powder formulation of SC exendin 9-39 which requires reconstitution and from patients dosed with a more patient friendly, novel, ready-to-use liquid formulation of SC exendin 9-39. SC exendin 9-39 liquid and lyophilized formulations: Reduced postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, Reduced hypoglycemic symptoms and Well tolerated with no related adverse events. SC exendin 9-39 liquid formulation: Improved postprandial metabolic and clinical parameters with comparable or greater activity against the lyophilized formulation and Produced a pharmacokinetic profile which may confer a longer duration of action versus the lyophilized formulation.


Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Results Demonstrating Benefit of Ubenimex and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) Modulation in Experimental Lymphedema
May 17 17
Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. announced publication in Science Translational Medicine (STM) the results of extensive preclinical studies of ubenimex in which modulation of the inflammatory mediator, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), improved experimental lymphedema. Targeted reduction of LTB4 with ubenimex reversed edema, improved lymphatic function and restored lymphatic architecture in experimental models of lymphedema. The technology was invented by Stanley Rockson, MD, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University, which Eiger exclusively licensed in 2015. Based on these findings, Eiger is conducting ULTRA, a multi-center, Phase 2 clinical study of ubenimex in Secondary Lymphedema, currently enrolling at multiple sites in the U.S. and Australia. Lymphedema is a state of vascular functional insufficiency in which decreased lymphatic clearance of interstitial fluid leads to edema formation, and progressive, debilitating architectural alterations of the skin and supporting tissues. Lymphedema typically manifests itself in an arm or leg, but can affect other parts of the body. Lymphedema often causes long-term physical, psychological, and social problems for patients and significantly impacts quality of life. There is no approved pharmacologic therapy.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  You should read the following discussion and analysis of Eiger's financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Eiger's consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 23, 2017. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this report.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of  Overview  We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing to market novel product candidates for the treatment of orphan diseases. Since our founding in 2008, we have worked with investigators at Stanford University and evaluated a number of potential development candidates from pharmaceutical companies to comprise a pipeline of novel product candidates. Our resulting pipeline includes four Phase 2 candidates addressing four distinct orphan diseases. The programs have several aspects in common: the disease targets represent conditions of high medical need which are inadequately treated by current standard of care; the therapeutic approaches are supported by an understanding of disease biology and mechanism as elucidated by our academic research relationships; prior clinical experience with the product candidates guides an understanding of safety; and the development paths leverage the experience and capabilities of our experienced, commercially focused management team. The pipeline includes lonafarnib for Hepatitis Delta Virus, or HDV, lambda for HDV, exendin 9-39 for Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia, or PBH, and ubenimex for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or PAH, and lymphedema. We plan to deliver data from all ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials over the course of the next eighteen months as illustrated in the following table.  We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception and we do not anticipate that we will achieve profitability in the near term. Our net losses were $11.2 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $87.6 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we initiate and continue the clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate pipeline of products. In addition, we are now operating as a publicly traded company following the reverse merger with Celladon, and we will be hiring additional financial and other personnel, upgrading our financial information systems and incurring costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval.  Merger with Celladon  On March 22, 2016, we completed the reverse merger between Private Eiger and Celladon in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 18, 2015, by and among Private Eiger, Celladon and Celladon Merger Sub, Inc., or the Merger. Also on March 22, 2016, in connection with, and prior to the completion of the Merger, we effected a fifteen for one reverse stock split of our common stock, or the Reverse Stock Split, and changed our name to "Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc."  On November 18, 2015, in connection with the Merger, we entered into a subscription agreement, or the "Subscription Agreement" with investors for the sale of shares of our common stock, or the "Private Placement", which closed on March 22, 2016.  Immediately prior to and in connection with the Merger, each share of Private Eiger's preferred stock outstanding was converted into shares of Private Eiger's common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock for each share of preferred stock.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Celladon issued shares of common stock to Private Eiger stockholders, at an exchange ratio of approximately 0.09 shares of common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, in exchange for each share of Private Eiger's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The exchange ratio was calculated by a formula that was determined through arms-length negotiations between Celladon and Private Eiger. Immediately after the Merger, the former Private Eiger equity holders beneficially owned approximately 78% of post-merger Eiger's common stock. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition.  Financial Operations Overview  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research and development, such as the development of our product candidates. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following:   expenses incurred under agreements with consultants and clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;   laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials;   contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production of clinical supplies;   license fees associated with our license agreements; and   internal costs that are associated with activities performed by our research and development organization and generally benefit multiple programs. These costs are not separately allocated by product candidate. Unallocated internal research and development costs consist primarily of:   personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;   allocated facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and depreciation expense; and   regulatory expenses and technology license fees related to development activities.  The largest component of our operating expenses has historically been the investment in research and development activities. However, we do not allocate internal research and development costs, such as salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and indirect costs to product candidates on a program-specific basis. The following table shows our research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Product candidates: Lonafarnib HDV $ 1,119 $ 733 Lambda HDV 683 24 Exendin 9-39 PBH 723 116 Ubenimex PAH 2,627 2,978 Ubenimex Lymphedema 486 151 Internal research and development costs 1,826 843 Total research and development expense $ 7,464 $ 4,845  We expect research and development expenses will increase in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through later stage clinical trials and pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant investment in regulatory support and contract manufacturing and clinical trial material related costs. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, which may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee and/or milestone payments.  The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in timely developing and achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, intellectual property rights, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated expenses and expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit, accounting services and investor relations. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Allocated expenses consist of facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation expense and other supplies. During the three month ended March 31, 2016, we incurred incremental expenses as a result of the Merger. As a result of becoming a public company following completion of the Merger, expenses include costs related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ, additional insurance, investor relations, banking fees and other administrative expenses and professional services.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016, consists of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in November 2015 and then converted into common stock in March 2016, or the Notes. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, consists of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the Oxford Loan and related borrowing in December 2016.  Interest Income  Interest income consists of interests earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents.  Other expense, net  Other expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2106, consists of the change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose and the change in fair value of warrant liability.  The change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose was related to our obligation to issue shares to Eiccose upon the closing of the next round of financing that resulted in at least $25.0 million in gross proceeds to us. Upon the closing of the Private Placement on March 22, 2016, we issued to Eiccose 96,300 fully vested shares of our common stock in settlement of this obligation. In connection with this transaction we remeasured the fair value of the obligation to issue common stock at the settlement date and the change in fair value of $0.2 million was recognized within other expense, net during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Upon the settlement of the obligation with the issuance of shares on March 22, 2016, the liability was reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.  In connection with our issuance of the Notes, we issued warrants to the noteholders to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.11 per share, on a post-Merger and post-Reverse Stock Split basis, or the Warrants. The number of shares into which the Warrants could be exercised was equal to the warrant coverage amount divided by the per share price of the equity securities sold in a qualified financing and thus was accounted for as a liability. Upon the closing of the Private Placement on March 22, 2016, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants was fixed and the fair value remeasured at that date, and the warrants were automatically exercised. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a loss related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability of $0.2 million. The warrant liability was reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity, upon the exercise of the Warrants and issuance of shares on March 22, 2016.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 Three Months Ended March 31, $ % 2017 2016 Change Change Operating expenses: Research and development $ 7,464 $ 4,845 $ 2,619 54 % General and administrative 3,522 3,833 (311 ) 8 % Total operating expenses 10,986 8,678 2,308 Loss from operations (10,986 ) (8,678 ) (2,308 ) Interest expense (363 ) (685 ) 322 47 % Interest income 110 - 110 *% Other expense, net - (385 ) 385 *% Net loss $ (11,239 ) $ (9,748 ) $ (1,491 ) 15 %  * Percentage not meaningful  Research and development expenses  Research and development expenses increased by $2.6 million to $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in clinical expenditures due to increased program activity, a $0.9 million increase in compensation and personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount and a $0.1 million increase in consulting fees related to increased program activity.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.3 million to $3.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $3.8 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in legal, consulting, advisory and accounting services incurred related to the Merger in the first quarter 2016. The decrease was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $0.4 million increase in compensation and personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount and a $0.2 million increase in facility and insurance expenses related to increased operating activity.  Interest expense  Interest expense decreased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $0.7 million for the same period in 2016. Interest expense in 2016 consisted of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the Notes outstanding prior to their conversion into common stock in March 2016. Interest expense in 2017 consisted of interest and amortization of the debt discount related to the Oxford Loan related borrowings in December 2016.  Interest Income  Interest income increased by $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, due to the interest earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents. There were no interest income earned for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as funds were not invested until the fourth quarter in 2016.  Other expenses, net  Other expense, net of $0.4 million for the three months March 31, 2016, primarily consisted of the change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose and the change in fair value of warrant liability, that were settled upon the Merger. There were no such expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Sources of Liquidity  As of March 31, 2017, we had $14.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $34.6 million of marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of $87.6 million. We believe that the currently available resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months following the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, including research and development expenditures and general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Future Funding Requirements  We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any of our product candidates. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development and manufacturing activities, particularly as we continue the research, development, manufacture and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates.  Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, funding research efforts and the development of our product candidates, compensation and related expenses, hiring additional staff, including clinical, scientific, operational, financial, and management personnel, and costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.  We plan to continue to fund losses from operations and capital funding needs through future equity and/or debt financings, as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding we may be forced to delay, make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially harm our business.  Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (11,006 ) $ (3,713 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (2,356 ) 28,010 Net cash provided by financing activities 57 32,122 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (13,305 ) $ 56,419  Cash flows from operating activities  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $11.0 million, consisting of a net loss of $11.2 million, which was partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million. Additionally, cash used in operating activities reflected changes in net operating assets primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily associated with timing of payments.  Cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $3.7 million, consisting of a net loss of $9.7 million, which was partially offset by accounts payable of $4.1 million related to expenses incurred in connection with the private placement, the Merger. In addition, offsetting the net loss were noncash charges of $0.7 million related to non-cash interest expense for our Notes, $0.4 million related to changes in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose and our warrant liability and $0.3 million for stock-based compensation expense.  Cash flows from investing activities  Cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and primarily consisted of a $9.3 million purchase of marketable securities, offset by $6.9 million proceeds from maturities of marketable securities.  Cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the $28.0 million of cash received upon the consummation of the Merger.  Cash flows from financing activities  Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 consisted of $0.1 million of proceeds from the purchase of common stock under our ESPP.  Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily consisted of $32.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the private placement, net of issuance costs.  Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 (in thousands): Payments due by period Less More than 1 - 3 3 - 5 than Total 1 year Years Years 5 years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 401 $ 330 $ 71 $ - $ - Term loan debt (2) $ 15,000 $ - $ 12,083 $ 2,917 $ - Interest on term loan debt (3) $ 4,378 $ 979 $ 2,205 $ 1,194 $ - Total $ 19,779 $ 1,309 $ 14,359 $ 4,111 $ -  (1) Represents future rent payments under two Palo Alto facility lease contracts.  (2) Represents the Oxford first tranche Loan of $15.0 million.  (3) Includes an exit fee on the Oxford Loan of $1.125 million due at maturity.  In March, 2017, we entered into a non-cancelable facility lease agreement for an office facility in Palo Alto, California. The lease commenced on April 1, 2017 and expires 12 months after the commencement date. The lease has one 12 month renewal option prior to expiration and includes rent escalation clauses through the lease term. In April 2017, we provided a security deposit of $27,000 as collateral for the lease. The operating lease obligation amounts above do not reflect our future minimum rent payable under the new lease agreement of approximately $0.3 million during the next year.  We are obligated to make future payments to third parties under asset purchase and license agreements, including royalties and payments that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. We have not included these potential payment obligations in the table above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  . . .

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
