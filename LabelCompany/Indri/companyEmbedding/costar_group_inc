	PRESS RELEASE DETAIL


Sep 19, 2012
CoStar Group’s PPR Division Launches Expanded, Comprehensive Multi-Family Product
Washington, DC – September 19, 2012 – CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP),  commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services, today announced its Property & Portfolio Research (PPR) division has launched an expanded multi-family product powered by CoStar’s industry-leading commercial property database.
 Washington, DC – September 19, 2012 – CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP),  commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services, today announced its Property & Portfolio Research (PPR) division has launched an expanded multi-family product powered by CoStar’s industry-leading commercial property database. CoStar tracks detailed information on almost 400,000 multi-family properties in 210 U.S. markets and has been building the most comprehensive database of multi-family properties in the industry. The Company has established a dedicated team of 40 individuals that is specializing in the research and verification of multi-family information.   Along with independent research, analytics and actionable insights provided by PPR’s team of over 40 economists, the PPR multi-family product is designed to meet the information and analytics needs of PPR’s clients, including commercial banks, financial institutions, pension funds, insurance companies and government and rating agencies. “We believe the unparalleled combination of strong analytics from PPR coupled with CoStar’s unmatched, comprehensive data gives our clients who are interested in multi-family an outstanding resource for analyzing properties,” said Andrew C. Florance, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CoStar. CoStar has already expanded its detailed coverage on more than 25,000 multi-family properties, with information on unit count, unit size, asking rent, effective rent and vacancy. The number of properties with expanded information is expected to grow rapidly over the next 12 months and beyond. “With coverage of 210 markets, PPR plans to provide insight into the vast majority of U.S. cities, not just the big markets,” said Hans Nordby, Managing Director of PPR.  “This is a key point for lenders, who often serve a wide geographic footprint, as well as investors, who are investing in smaller cities.” “From an analytics perspective, we are going where no apartment research group has gone before,” Nordby continued.  “We expect to offer effective rent estimates, including forecasts at the metro and sub-market level, as well as demographic and demand driver screens at the street corner level, leveraging CoStar data that simply is not available elsewhere.”   About PPR Property and Portfolio Research (PPR) provides unparalleled expertise and objective thinking in analyzing and forecasting commercial real estate markets. PPR sets the pace in offering independent research, a unique set of analytic tools, and actionable insights to investors on hundreds of global markets in North America and Europe. Clients range from commercial banks and financial institutions to pension funds and insurance companies as well as government and rating agencies. With a dedicated commitment to providing the best in commercial real estate research, PPR's widely respected knowledge of the markets helps clients to stay ahead of market trends, act decisively, and feel confident about their investment decisions. PPR is a division of CoStar Group. About CoStar Group, Inc. CoStar Group (NASDAQ: CSGP) is commercial real estate's leading provider of information, analytics and marketing services. Founded in 1987, CoStar conducts expansive, ongoing research to produce and maintain the largest and most comprehensive database of commercial real estate information. Our suite of online services enables clients to analyze, interpret and gain unmatched insight on commercial property values, market conditions and current availabilities. Through LoopNet, the Company operates the most heavily trafficked commercial real estate marketplace online with more than 6.1 million registered members and 3.6 million unique monthly visitors. Headquartered in Washington, DC, CoStar maintains offices throughout the U.S. and in Europe including the industry's largest professional research organization. For more information, visit www.costar.com.     This news release includes "forward-looking statements" including, without limitation, statements regarding CoStar's expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. These statements are based upon current beliefs and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. The following factors, among others, could cause or contribute to such differences: the risk that the number of properties with expanded information does not grow rapidly over the next 12 months and beyond; the possibility that the product will be modified and therefore does not provide the details, services or coverage outlined in this release, including coverage of the vast majority of U.S. cities or effective rent estimates and forecast services at the metro and sub-market level; and the risk that the product does not launch when expected.  More information about potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar's filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including CoStar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and CoStar's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, under the heading "Risk Factors" section of each of these filings. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date hereof, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.'

I work here and I want to speak to some of the reviews.  The product is amazing and nothing like it exists in the market place, it definitely helps CRE professionals get the job done. For the multifamily person, a lot has changed since 2014 and with the purchase of several MF ILS's you can bet we have the best information.. I wish all my MF friends and clients had CoStar. As for the service, certainly everyone has had thier experience and it may very well been awful.. however if you have a good rep and trainer it shouldn't be. My advice is always reach out to your local rep before contacting 800 customer service, this should guarantee a better experience.  Something to note, contracts are 12 months and no flexibility exists.. it is all in the contract so hopefully your rep communicates all the imperative details but we are all in the business of signing contracts so be sure you read it.  Hopefully this helps some folks out.

San Diego CoStar Rep.







They have called me multiple times a day.  I finally got an employee named Roberto to tell me who they were. He told me, in very general terms, that they were collecting information for economic development in Tennessee and that my information would not be used for any marketing purposes.  He specifically said that, in addition to other agencies, they would provide my information to the Tennessee Department of Economic Community Development.  The various numbers from which I have received calls are (all with area code 615) 241-8240, 241-8252, 241-8259, 241-8243, 241-8237, 241-8245 and that is in 4 days.  I have adamantly told them to stop calling me and to put me on the "do not call" list.  We shall see if they stop.







So bad! Information is missing / out of date / incorrect. You can get better info from free google searches on public record sites. They will lock you into a contract and you will regret it every day thereafter.







Every day they call pretending to be interesting in renting an apartment. I have asked them many times to stop calling me, to remove anything related to our building from apartments .com, but they keep calling fishing for information to place on their website. They always call from spoofed phone numbers that if you try to call back they are numbers not in service. This is harassment, stop calling me.







They just called my work place claiming to be loop net a commercial real estate agency, Asked me a sh*t ton of questions. Time wasters all they want is information they can get it off google. Just like I got theirs and they can see that I know that they are full of SH*T!







These people hound real estate agents for data, endless calls asking you for information about what listings you have, what leases you have signed, then they turn around and try to sell you this data for thousands of dollars. Only a select few can afford Costar, yet they expect everyone to spend their time helping them maintain their databases. Xcelligent has a very similar service at a fraction of the cost so I use them, and I only provide my data to them.

Costar leaves tricky messages where they ask if a property is still available, but they don't say it is them calling, so they try and make you think you are returning a sales call. Dumb call center tricks.







They are asking you to list for free then they call every month to sell services we keep telling them we don't need.
We advertised with Costar for years and we received ZERO leads
And this is how cheep they are : 
They call my Tool Free number to sell me services!

Will never give you a penny  but you are costing me money every time you call.
STOP IT!







Sales people tell so many lies!!! First they told me Costar has every listing from Loopnet, which company they bought. NOT TRUE. I caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over. Secondly, the listing I put on Costar, I cannot really find it using Google, which means I have to manually put in a separate listing on Loopnet, after paying 30% more than Loopnet premium.  Loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar, even with a free account. So don't fall for these guys, and don't pay for a subscription.







I would do no stars if I could. We have had Costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year. They are much like the cable and phone companies. They get you under contract and then the service stops. My bill has been incorrect for 3 months now and no one seems to care, especially not my local rep. Glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate Costar all together. The contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business. Look for an alternative if you can. Hopefully the Costar monopoly is coming to an end.







Update 9/2/2016! - CoStar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning. It is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive email/phone campaign to get things done as promised (even though a few days late). We knew you could do it.  Hey CoStar, spend more time working and less making excuses.  You guys still have the best commercial property data, analytics and reports.

9/1/2016 - You guys have not changed!  Good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed. I was told by sales rep that CoStar prides themselves on a two day turn around. Two days! After talking for a year, waiting out our contract with XXXXX and negotiating for two weeks on the contract. We agreed to terms on Friday 8/26.  Received the contract Monday morning 8/29 which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than 9/1. I was just told we would not have access until Tuesday 9/6. Piss poor customer service. Something's really never change. Especially when associated with CoStar.







They hire young kids that are very unprofessional.  Stay away from this company the only good thing is they hire people that would be flipping burgers.  now if they would train them with some professionalism.  Seems to be a company that is hard up for business and money!! 
Any good company would treat customers better.  all the negative review are true!
Could not get training, had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide!   as soon as there contract is up we will cancel!!!!







CoStar Group - great product... with appalling customer service. We became customer a few months ago and STILL cannot get an account rep/trainer assigned to us. I followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating (not even mentioning the 1-800 number)... I have also expressed this frustration via Costar Group Facebook but they do not seem to care very much. Where is their Marketing and PR Department?







Costar is a bully. Have you ever read their contract. The only way out of your contract is bankruptcy. Even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues. All I asked for was to move my start date since I didn't use their service because I didn't feel right using something I would have problems paying for. You don't get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps. No one checks in with you if you don't login. And now that they own loopnet - they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either. I will never use costar. I have cancelled by loopnet and I will be using mls, commercial source, xceligent, and catalyst.







This place is ridiculous!!!!!!! They HARASS call people and they call my property management company about 3-5 times a day. When confronted about if they work for CoStar Group they LIE. If you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please STOP HARASSING PEOPLE and pick up your own phone! I have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too. Please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with FAKE phone calls and harassment.







Loopnet and CoStar deserve a zero rating. By far the most dishonest company I've dealt with in a while. I signed up for a Loppnet subscription, thinking it was a monthly plan. It turns out it was an annual commitment, and when I tried to cancel (I even suggested early termination fee), they said they didn't have a cancellation option. That's ridiculous! Everything can be cancelled, even with a penalty. Now I have to pay 9 months of subscription against my will. Stay away from Loopnet and CoStar.







Costar is the Monsanto of Commercial Real Estate, we strongly recommend to stay away from them.

Their sales agent, Noah, lied to us on many occasions and refused to cancel the auto renewal plan. Yes, we were set us up for a 2 year contract without being informed, the sales agent, evaded our many attempts to end the subscription by formulating various excuses and waste our time.

Their service is overpriced and obsolete. They claim they have an app but its full of bugs and crashes constantly. Loopnet offered a better alternative but has been bought by Costar and since became inefficient, closed and expensive.

Costar was a waste of time and money. Stay away!







Atrocious representatives and sales tactics. Paying for loop net. Coastar staff should be trained or REPLACED







CoStar Group deserves a negative rating, not one even one star.  They will do whatever it take to get you to sign a contract and lock you in without any options for termination whether  you use the service or not.  Sales and Management are as dishonest as they get.  No wonder they don't offer a free trials.  This was  by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.







CoStar deserves no stars at all! Their tech service should be called tech non-service.  I honestly wish that there was an alternative. I hate monopolies!







I subscribed to this relative worthless group thinking I could get more exposure for my listings.  WRONG.  I wanted to look for properties all over the west for my clients.  WRONG.  I have a property for sale in Indiana and wanted a list of brokers to contact. WRONG.  This company sucks, and the masses of info they give you MIGHT be of value to an office broker, but for multi-family NOT AT ALL.  They are a waste of money and time.  I should give them 0 stars, but I don't think I can.

Every day they call pretending to be interesting in renting an apartment. I have asked them many times to stop calling me, to remove anything related to our building from apartments .com, but they keep calling fishing for information to place on their website. They always call from spoofed phone numbers that if you try to call back they are numbers not in service. This is harassment, stop calling me.

They just called my work place claiming to be loop net a commercial real estate agency, Asked me a sh*t ton of questions. Time wasters all they want is information they can get it off google. Just like I got theirs and they can see that I know that they are full of SH*T!

These people hound real estate agents for data, endless calls asking you for information about what listings you have, what leases you have signed, then they turn around and try to sell you this data for thousands of dollars. Only a select few can afford Costar, yet they expect everyone to spend their time helping them maintain their databases. Xcelligent has a very similar service at a fraction of the cost so I use them, and I only provide my data to them.Costar leaves tricky messages where they ask if a property is still available, but they don't say it is them calling, so they try and make you think you are returning a sales call. Dumb call center tricks.

Sales people tell so many lies!!! First they told me Costar has every listing from Loopnet, which company they bought. NOT TRUE. I caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over. Secondly, the listing I put on Costar, I cannot really find it using Google, which means I have to manually put in a separate listing on Loopnet, after paying 30% more than Loopnet premium.  Loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar, even with a free account. So don't fall for these guys, and don't pay for a subscription.

I would do no stars if I could. We have had Costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year. They are much like the cable and phone companies. They get you under contract and then the service stops. My bill has been incorrect for 3 months now and no one seems to care, especially not my local rep. Glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate Costar all together. The contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business. Look for an alternative if you can. Hopefully the Costar monopoly is coming to an end.

Update 9/2/2016! - CoStar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning. It is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive email/phone campaign to get things done as promised (even though a few days late). We knew you could do it.  Hey CoStar, spend more time working and less making excuses.  You guys still have the best commercial property data, analytics and reports.9/1/2016 - You guys have not changed!  Good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed. I was told by sales rep that CoStar prides themselves on a two day turn around. Two days! After talking for a year, waiting out our contract with XXXXX and negotiating for two weeks on the contract. We agreed to terms on Friday 8/26.  Received the contract Monday morning 8/29 which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than 9/1. I was just told we would not have access until Tuesday 9/6. Piss poor customer service. Something's really never change. Especially when associated with CoStar.

Any good company would treat customers better.  all the negative review are true!Could not get training, had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide!   as soon as there contract is up we will cancel!!!!

CoStar Group - great product... with appalling customer service. We became customer a few months ago and STILL cannot get an account rep/trainer assigned to us. I followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating (not even mentioning the 1-800 number)... I have also expressed this frustration via Costar Group Facebook but they do not seem to care very much. Where is their Marketing and PR Department?

Costar is a bully. Have you ever read their contract. The only way out of your contract is bankruptcy. Even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues. All I asked for was to move my start date since I didn't use their service because I didn't feel right using something I would have problems paying for. You don't get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps. No one checks in with you if you don't login. And now that they own loopnet - they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either. I will never use costar. I have cancelled by loopnet and I will be using mls, commercial source, xceligent, and catalyst.

If you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please STOP HARASSING PEOPLE and pick up your own phone! I have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too. Please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with FAKE phone calls and harassment.

Loopnet and CoStar deserve a zero rating. By far the most dishonest company I've dealt with in a while. I signed up for a Loppnet subscription, thinking it was a monthly plan. It turns out it was an annual commitment, and when I tried to cancel (I even suggested early termination fee), they said they didn't have a cancellation option. That's ridiculous! Everything can be cancelled, even with a penalty. Now I have to pay 9 months of subscription against my will. Stay away from Loopnet and CoStar.

Costar is the Monsanto of Commercial Real Estate, we strongly recommend to stay away from them.Their sales agent, Noah, lied to us on many occasions and refused to cancel the auto renewal plan. Yes, we were set us up for a 2 year contract without being informed, the sales agent, evaded our many attempts to end the subscription by formulating various excuses and waste our time.Their service is overpriced and obsolete. They claim they have an app but its full of bugs and crashes constantly. Loopnet offered a better alternative but has been bought by Costar and since became inefficient, closed and expensive.Costar was a waste of time and money. Stay away!

CoStar Group deserves a negative rating, not one even one star.  They will do whatever it take to get you to sign a contract and lock you in without any options for termination whether  you use the service or not.  Sales and Management are as dishonest as they get.  No wonder they don't offer a free trials.  This was  by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.

I subscribed to this relative worthless group thinking I could get more exposure for my listings.  WRONG.  I wanted to look for properties all over the west for my clients.  WRONG.  I have a property for sale in Indiana and wanted a list of brokers to contact. WRONG.  This company sucks, and the masses of info they give you MIGHT be of value to an office broker, but for multi-family NOT AT ALL.  They are a waste of money and time.  I should give them 0 stars, but I don't think I can.

History

                    Established in 1987.
            

                While earning an economics degree at Princeton University in the mid-1980s, Andrew C. Florance also obtained his real estate license. During college, he began developing software, a skill he would leverage to start the CoStar Group. After college, Mr. Florance returned to Washington DC and began to buy and renovate abandoned buildings. He quickly grew frustrated with the quality of real estate information that was available, and used his software knowledge to develop a commercial multiple-listing database service. At the time, brokers spent a large amount of time and money manually gathering information that was then shared with others. Florance's concept was to centralize the process and make the information available to subscribers, putting economies of scale to work so that brokers could eliminate research staffs and obtain more accurate and comprehensive information at less expense.

I work here and I want to speak to some of the reviews.  The product is amazing and nothing like it exists in the market place, it definitely helps CRE professionals get the job done. For the multifamily person, a lot has changed since 2014 and with the purchase of several MF ILS's you can bet we have the best information.. I wish all my MF friends and clients had CoStar. As for the service, certainly everyone has had thier experience and it may very well been awful.. however if you have a good rep and trainer it shouldn't be. My advice is always reach out to your local rep before contacting 800 customer service, this should guarantee a better experience.  Something to note, contracts are 12 months and no flexibility exists.. it is all in the contract so hopefully your rep communicates all the imperative details but we are all in the business of signing contracts so be sure you read it.  Hopefully this helps some folks out.

San Diego CoStar Rep.







They have called me multiple times a day.  I finally got an employee named Roberto to tell me who they were. He told me, in very general terms, that they were collecting information for economic development in Tennessee and that my information would not be used for any marketing purposes.  He specifically said that, in addition to other agencies, they would provide my information to the Tennessee Department of Economic Community Development.  The various numbers from which I have received calls are (all with area code 615) 241-8240, 241-8252, 241-8259, 241-8243, 241-8237, 241-8245 and that is in 4 days.  I have adamantly told them to stop calling me and to put me on the "do not call" list.  We shall see if they stop.







So bad! Information is missing / out of date / incorrect. You can get better info from free google searches on public record sites. They will lock you into a contract and you will regret it every day thereafter.







Every day they call pretending to be interesting in renting an apartment. I have asked them many times to stop calling me, to remove anything related to our building from apartments .com, but they keep calling fishing for information to place on their website. They always call from spoofed phone numbers that if you try to call back they are numbers not in service. This is harassment, stop calling me.







They just called my work place claiming to be loop net a commercial real estate agency, Asked me a sh*t ton of questions. Time wasters all they want is information they can get it off google. Just like I got theirs and they can see that I know that they are full of SH*T!







These people hound real estate agents for data, endless calls asking you for information about what listings you have, what leases you have signed, then they turn around and try to sell you this data for thousands of dollars. Only a select few can afford Costar, yet they expect everyone to spend their time helping them maintain their databases. Xcelligent has a very similar service at a fraction of the cost so I use them, and I only provide my data to them.

Costar leaves tricky messages where they ask if a property is still available, but they don't say it is them calling, so they try and make you think you are returning a sales call. Dumb call center tricks.







They are asking you to list for free then they call every month to sell services we keep telling them we don't need.
We advertised with Costar for years and we received ZERO leads
And this is how cheep they are : 
They call my Tool Free number to sell me services!

Will never give you a penny  but you are costing me money every time you call.
STOP IT!







Sales people tell so many lies!!! First they told me Costar has every listing from Loopnet, which company they bought. NOT TRUE. I caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over. Secondly, the listing I put on Costar, I cannot really find it using Google, which means I have to manually put in a separate listing on Loopnet, after paying 30% more than Loopnet premium.  Loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar, even with a free account. So don't fall for these guys, and don't pay for a subscription.







I would do no stars if I could. We have had Costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year. They are much like the cable and phone companies. They get you under contract and then the service stops. My bill has been incorrect for 3 months now and no one seems to care, especially not my local rep. Glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate Costar all together. The contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business. Look for an alternative if you can. Hopefully the Costar monopoly is coming to an end.







Update 9/2/2016! - CoStar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning. It is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive email/phone campaign to get things done as promised (even though a few days late). We knew you could do it.  Hey CoStar, spend more time working and less making excuses.  You guys still have the best commercial property data, analytics and reports.

9/1/2016 - You guys have not changed!  Good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed. I was told by sales rep that CoStar prides themselves on a two day turn around. Two days! After talking for a year, waiting out our contract with XXXXX and negotiating for two weeks on the contract. We agreed to terms on Friday 8/26.  Received the contract Monday morning 8/29 which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than 9/1. I was just told we would not have access until Tuesday 9/6. Piss poor customer service. Something's really never change. Especially when associated with CoStar.







They hire young kids that are very unprofessional.  Stay away from this company the only good thing is they hire people that would be flipping burgers.  now if they would train them with some professionalism.  Seems to be a company that is hard up for business and money!! 
Any good company would treat customers better.  all the negative review are true!
Could not get training, had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide!   as soon as there contract is up we will cancel!!!!







CoStar Group - great product... with appalling customer service. We became customer a few months ago and STILL cannot get an account rep/trainer assigned to us. I followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating (not even mentioning the 1-800 number)... I have also expressed this frustration via Costar Group Facebook but they do not seem to care very much. Where is their Marketing and PR Department?







Costar is a bully. Have you ever read their contract. The only way out of your contract is bankruptcy. Even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues. All I asked for was to move my start date since I didn't use their service because I didn't feel right using something I would have problems paying for. You don't get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps. No one checks in with you if you don't login. And now that they own loopnet - they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either. I will never use costar. I have cancelled by loopnet and I will be using mls, commercial source, xceligent, and catalyst.







This place is ridiculous!!!!!!! They HARASS call people and they call my property management company about 3-5 times a day. When confronted about if they work for CoStar Group they LIE. If you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please STOP HARASSING PEOPLE and pick up your own phone! I have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too. Please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with FAKE phone calls and harassment.







Loopnet and CoStar deserve a zero rating. By far the most dishonest company I've dealt with in a while. I signed up for a Loppnet subscription, thinking it was a monthly plan. It turns out it was an annual commitment, and when I tried to cancel (I even suggested early termination fee), they said they didn't have a cancellation option. That's ridiculous! Everything can be cancelled, even with a penalty. Now I have to pay 9 months of subscription against my will. Stay away from Loopnet and CoStar.







Costar is the Monsanto of Commercial Real Estate, we strongly recommend to stay away from them.

Their sales agent, Noah, lied to us on many occasions and refused to cancel the auto renewal plan. Yes, we were set us up for a 2 year contract without being informed, the sales agent, evaded our many attempts to end the subscription by formulating various excuses and waste our time.

Their service is overpriced and obsolete. They claim they have an app but its full of bugs and crashes constantly. Loopnet offered a better alternative but has been bought by Costar and since became inefficient, closed and expensive.

Costar was a waste of time and money. Stay away!







Atrocious representatives and sales tactics. Paying for loop net. Coastar staff should be trained or REPLACED







CoStar Group deserves a negative rating, not one even one star.  They will do whatever it take to get you to sign a contract and lock you in without any options for termination whether  you use the service or not.  Sales and Management are as dishonest as they get.  No wonder they don't offer a free trials.  This was  by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.







CoStar deserves no stars at all! Their tech service should be called tech non-service.  I honestly wish that there was an alternative. I hate monopolies!







I subscribed to this relative worthless group thinking I could get more exposure for my listings.  WRONG.  I wanted to look for properties all over the west for my clients.  WRONG.  I have a property for sale in Indiana and wanted a list of brokers to contact. WRONG.  This company sucks, and the masses of info they give you MIGHT be of value to an office broker, but for multi-family NOT AT ALL.  They are a waste of money and time.  I should give them 0 stars, but I don't think I can.

Sales people tell so many lies!!! First they told me Costar has every listing from Loopnet, which company they bought. NOT TRUE. I caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over. Secondly, the listing I put on Costar, I cannot really find it using Google, which means I have to manually put in a separate listing on Loopnet, after paying 30% more than Loopnet premium.  Loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar, even with a free account. So don't fall for these guys, and don't pay for a subscription.

I would do no stars if I could. We have had Costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year. They are much like the cable and phone companies. They get you under contract and then the service stops. My bill has been incorrect for 3 months now and no one seems to care, especially not my local rep. Glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate Costar all together. The contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business. Look for an alternative if you can. Hopefully the Costar monopoly is coming to an end.

Update 9/2/2016! - CoStar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning. It is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive email/phone campaign to get things done as promised (even though a few days late). We knew you could do it.  Hey CoStar, spend more time working and less making excuses.  You guys still have the best commercial property data, analytics and reports.9/1/2016 - You guys have not changed!  Good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed. I was told by sales rep that CoStar prides themselves on a two day turn around. Two days! After talking for a year, waiting out our contract with XXXXX and negotiating for two weeks on the contract. We agreed to terms on Friday 8/26.  Received the contract Monday morning 8/29 which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than 9/1. I was just told we would not have access until Tuesday 9/6. Piss poor customer service. Something's really never change. Especially when associated with CoStar.

They hire young kids that are very unprofessional.  Stay away from this company the only good thing is they hire people that would be flipping burgers.  now if they would train them with some professionalism.  Seems to be a company that is hard up for business and money!! Any good company would treat customers better.  all the negative review are true!Could not get training, had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide!   as soon as there contract is up we will cancel!!!!

CoStar Group - great product... with appalling customer service. We became customer a few months ago and STILL cannot get an account rep/trainer assigned to us. I followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating (not even mentioning the 1-800 number)... I have also expressed this frustration via Costar Group Facebook but they do not seem to care very much. Where is their Marketing and PR Department?

Costar is a bully. Have you ever read their contract. The only way out of your contract is bankruptcy. Even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues. All I asked for was to move my start date since I didn't use their service because I didn't feel right using something I would have problems paying for. You don't get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps. No one checks in with you if you don't login. And now that they own loopnet - they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either. I will never use costar. I have cancelled by loopnet and I will be using mls, commercial source, xceligent, and catalyst.

If you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please STOP HARASSING PEOPLE and pick up your own phone! I have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too. Please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with FAKE phone calls and harassment.

Loopnet and CoStar deserve a zero rating. By far the most dishonest company I've dealt with in a while. I signed up for a Loppnet subscription, thinking it was a monthly plan. It turns out it was an annual commitment, and when I tried to cancel (I even suggested early termination fee), they said they didn't have a cancellation option. That's ridiculous! Everything can be cancelled, even with a penalty. Now I have to pay 9 months of subscription against my will. Stay away from Loopnet and CoStar.

Costar is the Monsanto of Commercial Real Estate, we strongly recommend to stay away from them.Their sales agent, Noah, lied to us on many occasions and refused to cancel the auto renewal plan. Yes, we were set us up for a 2 year contract without being informed, the sales agent, evaded our many attempts to end the subscription by formulating various excuses and waste our time.Their service is overpriced and obsolete. They claim they have an app but its full of bugs and crashes constantly. Loopnet offered a better alternative but has been bought by Costar and since became inefficient, closed and expensive.Costar was a waste of time and money. Stay away!

CoStar Group deserves a negative rating, not one even one star.  They will do whatever it take to get you to sign a contract and lock you in without any options for termination whether  you use the service or not.  Sales and Management are as dishonest as they get.  No wonder they don't offer a free trials.  This was  by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent.

I subscribed to this relative worthless group thinking I could get more exposure for my listings.  WRONG.  I wanted to look for properties all over the west for my clients.  WRONG.  I have a property for sale in Indiana and wanted a list of brokers to contact. WRONG.  This company sucks, and the masses of info they give you MIGHT be of value to an office broker, but for multi-family NOT AT ALL.  They are a waste of money and time.  I should give them 0 stars, but I don't think I can.

History

                    Established in 1987.
            

                While earning an economics degree at Princeton University in the mid-1980s, Andrew C. Florance also obtained his real estate license. During college, he began developing software, a skill he would leverage to start the CoStar Group. After college, Mr. Florance returned to Washington DC and began to buy and renovate abandoned buildings. He quickly grew frustrated with the quality of real estate information that was available, and used his software knowledge to develop a commercial multiple-listing database service. At the time, brokers spent a large amount of time and money manually gathering information that was then shared with others. Florance's concept was to centralize the process and make the information available to subscribers, putting economies of scale to work so that brokers could eliminate research staffs and obtain more accurate and comprehensive information at less expense. This commercial real estate database is the core of CoStar product offerings.

CoStar Group, Inc. Earnings Boosted by Apartments.com Growth
With its apartment rentals site dominating the competition, the real estate information provider is turning its focus toward strengthening its other core properties.

Source: CoStar Group Q4 2016 earnings press release.
What happened with CoStar Group this quarter? 
Costar's revenue rose 13% year over year to $218 million, driven by growth in its Apartments.com business and Costar Suite product line.
"Three years ago we saw an opportunity to capture the lead in the massive apartment rental listings industry, and we invested aggressively in Apartments.com to successfully capture that opportunity," said CoStar founder and CEO Andrew Florance in a press release. "Those investments have paid off as we have now taken the number one position in the industry in visits (as reported by comScore for December 2016), revenue, and momentum."
With its Apartments.com business firing on all cylinders, Costar Group is turning its attention toward the integration of two of its other core products.

As investments into Apartments.com shift to profits from Apartments.com, we are shifting our focus to an opportunity to accelerate CoStar revenue growth by merging the LoopNet information products into CoStar. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began expanding CoStar's research capabilities to support this strategy by opening a new research headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. We already have over 250 researchers in Richmond, and have increased research productivity by more than 100% year-over-year yielding higher quality research to support our CoStar upselling priorities in 2017 and 2018.

Those efforts are already starting to bear fruit, with CoStar enjoying strong bookings growth in the fourth quarter.

Our investment in our sales force in 2016 enabled us to achieve our best fourth quarter of net new bookings with $29 million, which is up 16% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially over the third quarter of 2016. In 2016, we also achieved our highest year ever of net new bookings of CoStar Suite. Our investments in Apartments.com also produced outstanding results, with multifamily net new bookings up over 60% in the fourth quarter of 2016 year-over-year.

CoStar's profitability also continues to improve. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, and other special items -- jumped 15% to $75 million, with adjusted EBITDA margin rising to 34.4% from 33.7% in the prior-year quarter.
All told, adjusted (non-GAAP) net income leapt 18% year over year to $42 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $1.29.





Looking forward
For the first quarter, CoStar Group forecasts revenue of approximately $223 million to $225 million, adjusted EBITDA of $57 million to $60 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.92 to $0.97.
CoStar also issued its full-year 2017 outlook, including:

Revenue of $935 million to $945 million, representing growth of 11% to 13% compared to 2016
Adjusted EBITDA of $260 million to $265 million, up 2% to 4% year over year
Non-GAAP EPS of $4.18 to $4.28, down 2% to flat versus 2016

As evidenced by its full-year guidance, CoStar expects its 2017 profits to be impacted by its integration and growth investments.
"2016 was a year of strong growth and rapid margin expansion for CoStar," said CFO Scott Wheeler. "As we look forward to 2017, we plan to reinvest a modest portion of these margin gains back in the business before continuing to expand our margins as we exit 2017."
Looking further ahead, CoStar expects these investments to pay dividends in 2018.
"We believe we will exceed our goal of $1 billion in revenue in 2018 and remain committed to achieving 40% margin in the fourth quarter of 2018," said Florance.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
