            COMMENTEMAILMOREST. GEORGE  – Jerry C. Atkin, chairman and chief executive officer of SkyWest, Inc., said he never imagined when he became the youngest president of a regional airline service that he’d one day manage a billion-dollar company.“That first year was rough,” he said. “I learned one of the best lessons of my life, but I would never live it again for anything.”Now Atkin is the longest-tenured CEO in the airline industry.He joined SkyWest in 1974 as the director of finance, two years after his uncle, Ralph Atkin, founded SkyWest Airlines in St. George.The first two years were rough on the company, which is when Jerry Atkin stepped in to help, he said.Born and raised in St. George, Jerry Atkin said he never anticipated moving back to Southern Utah after leaving for northern Utah.“St. George population at the time was (about) 7,500,” he said. “There weren’t jobs to be had in St. George. But then I thought, maybe this is my business opportunity and besides that, I can move back home.”Atkin and his wife, who was pregnant with their first child, moved back to St. George where he helped turn around the failing SkyWest Airlines.With just three 9-passenger planes and about 20 employees, it quickly became evident the company was going to go under, Atkin said.“We knew we were in over our head,” he said. “We couldn’t give it away.”With no other choice, Atkin was tasked with coming up with a feasible way to save the company, he said.“I put together a simple plan to try and turn things around,” he said. “I didn’t have a grand plan, but I wanted to make sure we were offering reliable air travel to Salt Lake City and to the Las Vegas connection.”After laying off some of the employees and filling in gaps in employment himself, Atkin said the company slowly started to turn around.“We were just a bunch of young guys looking to make something work,” he said. “We worked our way through it and we managed to gross over a million dollars that year and made $15,000 net profit.”That year, at age 26, Atkin became president of the company after his uncle stepped down.“The company was a small, dinky company but it was a big deal to us, and we were taking it seriously,” he said. “How we go about doing things now is a lot more complicated, but the simplicity is still the same now as it was then. Take care of your customers and take care of your team.”From the company’s beginnings with three planes and 20 employees, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines, also under Atkin’s operations, has nearly 20,000 employees and a revolving fleet of about 716 planes, Atkin said.SkyWest serves 186 cities in the United States and Canadian provinces and seven cities in Mexico and the Bahamas. ExpressJet serves 192 cities in 41 states, District of Columbia, Bahamas, Canada, Mexico, and Turks and Caicos. SkyWest carried 27.4 million passengers in 2013 and ExpressJet carried 33.2 million, according to information from SkyWest.Marissa Snow, director of corporate communications and people programs at SkyWest, said Atkin’s commitment to his employees and customers is a large part of what has made the company successful.In addition to the strong team of employees at SkyWest, Atkin said not being afraid to take risks and being persistent in the name of business also is part of the company’s success story.“We had a capable bunch, and we’ve been able to pull off some things most people would think you couldn’t do,” he said. “We just stuck with it and we never gave up. There is a huge lesson in just plain persisting.”Throughout his time as president and CEO, Atkin helped the company form partnerships with major airlines like United and Delta to help expand its reach for flights as a regional airline company, he said. He also helped bring in cutting edge airline engine technology to help the planes fly under a variety of temperatures and elevations.Snow said Atkin’s commitment to taking calculated risks is what helped grow the company to its current success.“(Jerry has been good to) be on the front end of new adaptations and continue to adapt and be able to foster that type of culture within (the company),” she said.The company, and St. George, has changed in many ways over the years, Atkin said.“It’s been like starting a new job every two years,” he said. “It’s been fun and it’s been challenging. It’s been fun to engage in the change and see what needs to be done differently.”Moving forward, Atkin said he has a strong group of leaders working with him to help manage and operate SkyWest, which is allowing him to slowly take a step back from regular operations so he can spend more time with his family – wife, four children and five grandchildren.“It puts the company in a good position for still having its needs met for the traveling public,” he said. “I love spending time with family and it’s been a good 40 years, a great 40 years in business, but a great time with the family, too.”Follow Samantha Sadlier on Twitter, @SpectrumSadlier.

Compare South Beach Diet to Atkins

On the South Beach Diet, you'll lose weight with plenty of lean protein and heart-healthy good fats that nourish and satisfy—an approach that literally turns off the switch for sugar and refined-carb cravings.
Atkins' approach heavily restricts carbs and their packaged foods are higher in sodium and saturated fat.

Roasted Turkey with Herb Gravy (213g)
0.5g Saturated Fat 470mg Sodium


Roasted Chicken Pomodoro (261g)
1.5g Saturated Fat 590mg Sodium


Texas Style Chili (224g)
3g Saturated Fat 540mg Sodium


Sesame Glazed Beef & Veggie Bowl (221g)
2g Saturated Fat 400mg Sodium

 View Plan 









Lose Weight and Live a Heart-Healthy Life Without Hunger or Deprivation.
The South Beach Diet, created by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Agatston, incorporates heart-healthy, unsaturated fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts, in place of unhealthy fats. These “good fats” will help you lose weight fast without being hungry.








Enjoy Delicious Meals and More Variety with the South Beach Diet.
With a wide variety of fully prepared meals, the South Beach Diet offers hearty, delicious breakfasts, lunch and dinner entr�es, and savory or sweet snacks in a range of globally inspired flavors. Enjoy a different dish each meal without growing tired of eating the same old thing. You won't be limited to just bars, shakes, and a handful of prepared meals like you are on Atkins.










Lose weight and get in the best shape of your life with the South Beach Diet!

Science







Discover the Science Behind the Magic of the South Beach Diet
A no fads, no gimmicks approach to weight loss developed by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston. 







One thing was clear to Dr. Agatston. His patients were frustrated. They were confused by the conflicting information swirling around about quick fix diets that left them tired and hungry.
The South Beach Diet was his solution. Understand: The South Beach Diet incorporates good carbs, healthy fats and plenty of lean protein. Nutrient-dense foods that can turn off the switch for sugar and refined carb cravings.
This healthy way of eating has been around for years, but it's Dr. Agatston and his famous 3-phase approach which has allowed over 11 million people to choose South Beach Diet to meet their goals.
Now it's your turn!
View Plan







“No sane eating program expects you to go through life feeling discomfort and hungry.”
        





Burn Fat Without Hunger


In Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet, you'll stay away from sugar and refined carbohydrates–foods that digest quickly, cause you to be dependent on carbs, and keep you trapped in a constant cycle of cravings and overeating.
During these two weeks, you'll reboot your body, eating foods high in lean protein, plenty of vegetables and healthy fats. Now your body will attack your fat, burning it for fuel since your carb intake is being kept at a low consumption rate. You'll lose weight fast without being hungry.












As your body converts fat to energy, shifting your internal chemistry, your cravings for junk food and sugar recedes, replaced with a growing need for healthy, nutritious foods.
Your body is now reset and you're ready to move on to the next phase of your diet.










Put the science to work and lose weight on South Beach!


View Plan










Advance to Steady Weight Loss
As you transition into Phase 2 carb-heavy foods are no longer your must-have source of fuel. You've trained your body to burn fat for fuel—weight loss will continue at a steady pace. You're ready to reintroduce fruit, whole grains and some starchy vegetables, enjoying them in moderation. Having successfully reset your body, you'll find that your body wants different foods than it did before—foods that fuel! This balanced approach to eating will drive you toward your goal weight.






 “IT'S THE MOST SATISFYING WAY OF EATING EVER!”
        







South Beach—The Diet You Live With Happily!
You're now living your life in Phase 3, enjoying a variety of food that nourish and satisfy. You understand how to make good food choices, eating all foods in moderation. You've learned how to choose the right carbs and the right fats and avoid the bad carbs and fats–and you don't miss them. You enjoy foods that taste good, satisfy your appetite and don't create hunger hours later. It's a heart-healthy way of eating for the rest of your life. After all, the South Beach Diet is a science that works, for life.

Now instead of being tired all the time, I feel energized and can keep up with my busy schedule. Even better, my kids and my husband are eating healthier too. Thank you, South Beach.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
