Bright House Networks LLC was an American telecom company. Prior to its purchase by Charter Communications, it was the tenth-largest multichannel video service provider and the 6th largest cable internet provider (based on coverage) in the United States.[2] The company served more than 2.2 million customers.[3]
Bright House Networks' primary service offerings included digital television, high-speed internet, home security and automation and voice services.[3]
Bright House Networks also owned and operated two 24-hour local news operations; Central Florida News 13 serving the Orlando area, and Bay News 9 serving the Tampa Bay area.[4]

History[edit]
Prior to 1994, some of the systems were fully owned by Advance/Newhouse under the names Vision Cable and Cable Vision (no relation to Cablevision in the New York City metro area), while in other areas, Bright House Networks is the successor to TelePrompTer Cable TV, Group W Cable, Strategic Cable, Paragon Cable, Shaw Communications and the Tampa Bay/Orlando Time Warner Communications (previously Time Inc.'s American Television & Communications before the Time Warner merger) systems in Florida.
All of the systems that eventually came to be owned by Bright House Networks were previously owned by the Time Warner Entertainment–Advance/Newhouse Partnership. Bright House Networks, LLC was formerly known as TWEAN Subsidiary, LLC and changed its name to Bright House Networks, LLC in April 2003.[5] Under a deal struck in 2003, Advance/Newhouse took direct management and operational responsibility for a portion of the partnership cable systems roughly equal to their equity. Bright House Networks offers video, high-speed data, home security and automation and voice services. In addition, Bright House Networks operated two regional local news channels – Bay News 9 in the Tampa Bay market, and News 13 in the Orlando market. Bright House Networks had an extensive fiber optic network in the Florida area and used it to provide commercial services including dedicated Internet access, VPN services, and private network transport as well as telecom facilities such as SIP trunking and PRI service.
On March 31, 2015, Charter Communications announced it would acquire Bright House in a $10.4 billion deal, contingent on Time Warner Cable waiving its right of first refusal to acquire the latter company, which was not expected to be exercised given the then-pending Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger.[6] On May 26, 2015, after Comcast had abandoned its plans to buy Time Warner Cable, Charter announced its own plans to merge with TWC, as well as a renegotiated arrangement for the purchase of Bright House. If both deals are completed, Advance/Newhouse will gain a stake of roughly 14 percent in the combined company.[7] On April 25, 2016 regulators approved both mergers. As a result of the deal, the Bright House and Time Warner Cable brands will be phased out and eliminated completely, with both services amalgamated under Charter's Spectrum brand over the coming months.[8]
Service area[edit]
The company provided service to areas including Indianapolis, Central Florida (Orlando / Daytona Beach areas), Tampa/Lakeland area, Birmingham–Hoover area, west suburban Detroit, and Bakersfield. Most of its former business was concentrated in Central Florida.
Naming rights[edit]
Bright House Networks owns the naming rights to UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium (now Spectrum Stadium) in Orlando, Florida; Bright House Field (now Spectrum Field) in Clearwater, Florida, the spring training home of the Phillies; and the Bright House Networks Amphitheatre in Bakersfield, California. They formerly served as title sponsor of the Futures Tour Bright House Networks Open golf tournament, held in Lakeland, Florida.
Carriage disputes[edit]
When Bright House Networks was separate from Time Warner Cable, most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by Time Warner Cable.[9] Thus, Bright House customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between TWC and a content provider, which has happened several times.




Bright House Networks Spectrum



From its inception in 2003, Bright House's systems in central Florida, including Orlando, refused to carry Fox Sports Florida. This dated back to when the central Florida cable franchise was held by Cablevision, and then Time Warner Cable. As Bright House is by far the largest cable provider in central Florida, this left most of the Orlando area without most Orlando Magic games. The dispute ended in 2009, when Bright House added Fox Sports Florida to its lineup.
On September 15, 2008 Bright House temporarily dropped stations owned by the LIN TV Corporation on its Pensacola, DeFuniak Springs and Indiana systems. Affected stations were WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama, WISH-TV/WNDY-TV/WIIH-CA in Indianapolis and WANE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Even though the controversy was focused on Time Warner Cable systems, Bright House was included in the dispute, in areas where they were formerly owned by Time Warner. With both companies factored in, a total of 15 markets were affected.[10]
On December 31, 2008, Time Warner Cable and Viacom's MTV Networks had not agreed to renew any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Therefore, Time Warner and Bright House Networks would have lost all 19 Viacom channels (including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon) starting on January 1, 2009.[11][12] This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after 12 Midnight ET on January 1, 2009.[13]
In December 2009, the Fox Broadcasting Company announced that a dispute with Time Warner Cable could lead to Fox's owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from Bright House systems in the Detroit, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Gainesville markets, along with Fox's cable and sports channels in all markets served by Bright House. The carriage protests were announced shortly before Fox was to carry the Bowl Championship Series, which included the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. The dispute excluded Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and some regional sports channels, which are on separate contracts.[14][15] Shortly before the 12 midnight ET deadline on December 31, 2009, Fox granted Time Warner Cable and Bright House a brief extension during New Year's Day as talks continued, so viewers would not miss the Sugar Bowl, though the other bowl games and the NFL lineup remained at risk.[16] A settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of January 1, 2010, though no terms were disclosed; during the discussions that day, none of Fox's channels or stations were blacked out.[17]
In July 2010, ABC's parent company, Disney, announced that Disney was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable for the first time since 2000 (because Bright House Networks deals are negotiated by Time Warner Cable, Bright House customers were also affected). In Bright House-served areas, the dispute involved the Disney Channel, Disney XD, ABC Family, and all the networks of ESPN. Despite word of an early agreement on August 30, 2010,[18] it was not until the evening of the September 2 deadline that an agreement was reached between Disney and Time Warner Cable.[19][20][21]
On July 9, 2012, Hearst Television removed its stations from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal.[22] In the interim, WESH Orlando was replaced on Bright House systems in Central Florida with WBRE-TV Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a station owned by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group,[23] while other Hearst stations on Bright House were replaced with other cable channels offered by Bright House. Nexstar complained that Bright House has used WBRE's signal outside their markets without permission, while Bright House argued it was within its rights to use that station's signal as a replacement until a deal with Hearst was reached.[24] According to Time Warner Cable, the dispute stemmed from Hearst's demand of a 300% increase in its retransmission fees.[22] The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.[25]
On August 2, 2013 at 5 pm, the carriage deal between CBS and Time Warner Cable expired, with no renewal deal being reached until a month later. Time Warner had major markets affected by the blackout, while only a few Bright House markets lost access to CBS and CW stations owned by CBS Television Stations, as well as cable channels FLIX and The Smithsonian Channel; Bright House's territory includes CBSTS-owned broadcast stations Tampa CW station WTOG-TV and Detroit's WKBD-TV and WWJ-TV on their Livonia, Michigan system, which were blacked out.[26]) Premium channels Showtime and The Movie Channel, which are also owned by CBS, were similarly pulled from the cable lineup, including the corresponding Video On Demand services. Bright House said that CBS withdrew permission to air Showtime, while CBS denied that and called the blackout a "punitive" measure by TWC.[27]

Form an LLC in Florida.

$49 + State Fee & 1st Year FREE Registered Agent
Start My LLC













How to Start an LLC in Florida in 3 Steps
Whether you are launching a new company right out of college, or starting a business in retirement, the state of Florida is brimming with opportunity. The Sunshine State is well known for its favorable business climate, offering several tax advantages, profit flexibility, and fewer fees than in other states. Still, there are a few unique bylaws you need to know. Here’s how to form your Florida LLC.


Step 1: Your Florida LLC’s Name
The first step in forming a new LLC in Florida is to create and file your LLC name. This name must be recognizably different from any other business name registered in Florida. You can call and ask about the availability of a name by calling the state LLC filing office, or you can research LLC name availability on the Florida Division of Corporations’ website. However, Florida does not allow you to reserve a prospective name ahead of time.
There are a few additional rules for naming your new Florida LLC:

What you can’t do: The LLC’s name can’t have language that could give the impression it has been started for a business purpose other than that stated in its articles of organization, or one that’s not allowed by state law. It also cannot give the impression that the LLC is connected with the federal or state government.
What you must do: As the last words of the name, the words “Limited Company” or “Limited Liability Company,” or the abbreviations “L.C.” or “L.L.C.” must be included. “Limited” can be shortened to “Ltd.” and “Company” may be abbreviated as “Co.”

Step 2: Create and File Your Articles of Organization

Now that you have a name for your Florida LLC, Incfile can help you file your articles of organization with the Florida Department of State’s Division of Corporations. The articles of organization must state:


The LLC name.
The names and addresses of the organizers.
The address of the LLC’s primary place of business.
The articles have to be signed by at least one organizer or an authorized representative of an organizer.
The articles of organization may also contain other things chosen by the members (so long as they are not contrary to law), such as whether the LLC will be managed by a manager or managers.
The name and street address of the LLC’s registered agent, along with a statement that the agent agrees to the appointment and the duties it entails.


Requirements for Florida LLC Registered Agents

Florida LLCs must have a registered agent living in Florida who can receive official correspondence from the state, both administrative and legal. A registered agent for a Florida LLC can be an individual resident of Florida whose business office is the same as the registered office, or a business entity (foreign or domestic) that can conduct business in Florida, and whose business office is the same as the registered office.
Incfile can provide registered agent service for your Florida LLC, if needed.

The new LLC is recognized as “organized” once the articles of organization and a copy are delivered to the Secretary of State’s office with the required filing fee, and that office confirms that they are in order. Your LLC is not a legal business entity until the state of Florida has filed the company.
Florida LLC Filing Fees
The filing fee is $125, and checks should be made payable to the Florida Department of State. For additional fees, you can get a certified copy of your articles from the LLC filing office, and a Certificate of Status that certifies that your LLC has an active status. The LLC will be presumed to be perpetual in duration unless otherwise stated in the articles of organization.
Step 3: Create an Operating Agreement for Your Florida LLC
After its articles of organization, the LLC’s most vital document is the operating agreement, which can be amended or repealed as specified by either the agreement itself or applicable law. Just like a corporation’s bylaws, the operating agreement isn’t required by state law, but it’s a critical internal document that officially sets out how the LLC will operate. An LLC’s operating agreement should list:

The members (see below for how membership works in a Florida LLC)
How much each has invested
How profits are to be divided
How much of a voting share each member has when voting.
It may also specify requirements for meetings, such as how much notice, how many members constitute a quorum, voting rules, and so on. It also usually includes state-mandated requirements so that all the LLC’s operational rules are laid out in one place.

The articles of organization can also include constraints on members’ authority to adopt, amend, or repeal an operating agreement. If there is more than one member when the LLC is formed, the initial operating agreement must be approved in writing by all members.
How Membership Works in a Florida LLC
Florida LLCs must have one or more members, all of whom are individuals (not business entities). To become a member, one normally needs to make some kind of contribution, pay cash, or transfer property to the LLC, or take on an obligation to do so.
Member contributions to the LLC can be in cash, property, promissory notes, services already or to be rendered, or some other obligation to contribute cash, property, or contracts for services.

A member can resign from an LLC so long as he or she follows the procedures listed in the articles of organization or the operating agreement, which also usually specify a minimum amount of time before a member is allowed to resign. LLCs have the option of pursuing remedies for damages to the LLC caused by a member’s resignation.

Ongoing Requirements for LLCs in Florida, Including Taxes
There are several filing and record-keeping tasks that LLCs owners in Florida need to remember to do. Florida LLCs must file a report annually with the Florida Secretary of State that specifies the following:

The LLC names and the governmental jurisdiction under which it was organized.
The LLC’s date of organization, or, if it’s a foreign LLC, the date on which it was authorized to do business in the state.
The county and street address of the LLC’s registered office.
The name of the LLC’s registered agent at the registered Florida office.
The mailing and street addresses of its primary place of business.
The LLC’s federal employer identification number (EIN) or, if it doesn’t have one, whether one has been applied for.
The names and addresses of its managing members or managers.
Any additional information requested by the Secretary of State.

When you work with Incfile, we will send you courtesy email reminders at the approach of due dates for Florida’s ongoing requirements.
Taxes Info for Florida LLCs
Taxes are another ongoing issue for LLC owners. LLCs do offer tax advantages over a corporation, such as the availability of more deductions. Additionally, an LLC does not have to be a separate tax entity in the same way as a corporation. Instead, it can be a “pass-through” entity for tax purposes, so that the LLC owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns, in the same way as a partnership.
Unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation, the IRS treats single-member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes. This means the LLC itself does not pay taxes on its own account and does not have to file a tax return.
The IRS treats multiple-member LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes, unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. The result of this is that LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns, rather than the LLC itself.
The LLC tax rate for Florida varies based on taxable net income.
Dissolution of an LLC in Florida
A Florida LLC is considered dissolved when any one of these events occur:

Event(s) happen specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement as requiring dissolution.
Agreement to dissolve by a number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement.
An event that makes it illegal for the LLC to continue.
When a member leaves the LLC, unless the remaining members agree within 90 days to continue the LLC.
A judicial decree is entered that orders dissolution.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

required if seeking foreign qualification in any
other state.

Why Thousands of 
Small Business Owners Choose Incfile

Deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process.

There are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that
can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges. Although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed
below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies.











#1. Value – Nobody gives you more for less!



 .. more


First and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is $49 plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it
for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you. 
Our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has
been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you. 
less












#2. Registered Agent Service - 1st Year Free!



 .. more


Each of our 3 packages include a 1 free year of registered agent service, if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not
obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish. 
After the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of $99. We do not ever under any circumstance
charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment
information.
We only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say 6 weeks or 3
months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making
the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state.
less












#3. Transparency



 .. more


We have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the
order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation
is complete.
On the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity
type have been selected titled "[State] Compulsory Filing Requirements".
We strongly urge you to review this link as many states i.e. Nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the
entity being filed. The link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states
require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax, we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost. 
less












#4. Notifications



 .. more


All of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of
important filing dates regarding their entities. These emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or
franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates. 
less












#5. Internal Documents



 .. more


It is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization /
incorporation with the state. Depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an LLC or the
Directors and Shareholders of a corporation.
We create custom Operating Agreements for the LLLC which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member. In addition we also
create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the Directors and Shareholders as well as the
number of shares that each shareholder owns.
The internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the Statement of the Organizer / Incorporator and
banking resolutions. If changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they
can be customized as needed.
less












#6. Electronic Copies



 .. more


 We know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every
filing in digital format should you need it in the future. 
less












#7. Privacy



 .. more


You can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such. We do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside
business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena.
Although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in.
We also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site i.e. Social Security
Numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed
less












#8. Sales Practices



 .. more


We do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be
knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company.
We only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs. Even though it is much more
profitable for us, we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is
physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in
the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location.
We would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have
detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken. Follow the link for more information regarding this
less












#9. Experience



 .. more


When we entered this industry in 2003, the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today. Through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today.
We have formed well over 100,000 companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence. What
that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in
filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the 50 states.
less












#10. Humility



 .. more


At the end of the day we know that we are not perfect, we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live
person. However if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to
ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience.
Our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to
man the phones. If you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
the bottom right of each page of our site.

Bright House Networks LLC was an American telecom company. Prior to its purchase by Charter Communications, it was the tenth-largest multichannel video service provider and the 6th largest cable internet provider (based on coverage) in the United States.[2] The company served more than 2.2 million customers.[3]
Bright House Networks' primary service offerings included digital television, high-speed internet, home security and automation and voice services.[3]
Bright House Networks also owned and operated two 24-hour local news operations; Central Florida News 13 serving the Orlando area, and Bay News 9 serving the Tampa Bay area.[4]

History[edit]
Prior to 1994, some of the systems were fully owned by Advance/Newhouse under the names Vision Cable and Cable Vision (no relation to Cablevision in the New York City metro area), while in other areas, Bright House Networks is the successor to TelePrompTer Cable TV, Group W Cable, Strategic Cable, Paragon Cable, Shaw Communications and the Tampa Bay/Orlando Time Warner Communications (previously Time Inc.'s American Television & Communications before the Time Warner merger) systems in Florida.
All of the systems that eventually came to be owned by Bright House Networks were previously owned by the Time Warner Entertainment–Advance/Newhouse Partnership. Bright House Networks, LLC was formerly known as TWEAN Subsidiary, LLC and changed its name to Bright House Networks, LLC in April 2003.[5] Under a deal struck in 2003, Advance/Newhouse took direct management and operational responsibility for a portion of the partnership cable systems roughly equal to their equity. Bright House Networks offers video, high-speed data, home security and automation and voice services. In addition, Bright House Networks operated two regional local news channels – Bay News 9 in the Tampa Bay market, and News 13 in the Orlando market. Bright House Networks had an extensive fiber optic network in the Florida area and used it to provide commercial services including dedicated Internet access, VPN services, and private network transport as well as telecom facilities such as SIP trunking and PRI service.
On March 31, 2015, Charter Communications announced it would acquire Bright House in a $10.4 billion deal, contingent on Time Warner Cable waiving its right of first refusal to acquire the latter company, which was not expected to be exercised given the then-pending Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger.[6] On May 26, 2015, after Comcast had abandoned its plans to buy Time Warner Cable, Charter announced its own plans to merge with TWC, as well as a renegotiated arrangement for the purchase of Bright House. If both deals are completed, Advance/Newhouse will gain a stake of roughly 14 percent in the combined company.[7] On April 25, 2016 regulators approved both mergers. As a result of the deal, the Bright House and Time Warner Cable brands will be phased out and eliminated completely, with both services amalgamated under Charter's Spectrum brand over the coming months.[8]
Service area[edit]
The company provided service to areas including Indianapolis, Central Florida (Orlando / Daytona Beach areas), Tampa/Lakeland area, Birmingham–Hoover area, west suburban Detroit, and Bakersfield. Most of its former business was concentrated in Central Florida.
Naming rights[edit]
Bright House Networks owns the naming rights to UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium (now Spectrum Stadium) in Orlando, Florida; Bright House Field (now Spectrum Field) in Clearwater, Florida, the spring training home of the Phillies; and the Bright House Networks Amphitheatre in Bakersfield, California. They formerly served as title sponsor of the Futures Tour Bright House Networks Open golf tournament, held in Lakeland, Florida.
Carriage disputes[edit]
When Bright House Networks was separate from Time Warner Cable, most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by Time Warner Cable.[9] Thus, Bright House customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between TWC and a content provider, which has happened several times.




Bright House Networks Spectrum



From its inception in 2003, Bright House's systems in central Florida, including Orlando, refused to carry Fox Sports Florida. This dated back to when the central Florida cable franchise was held by Cablevision, and then Time Warner Cable. As Bright House is by far the largest cable provider in central Florida, this left most of the Orlando area without most Orlando Magic games. The dispute ended in 2009, when Bright House added Fox Sports Florida to its lineup.
On September 15, 2008 Bright House temporarily dropped stations owned by the LIN TV Corporation on its Pensacola, DeFuniak Springs and Indiana systems. Affected stations were WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama, WISH-TV/WNDY-TV/WIIH-CA in Indianapolis and WANE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Even though the controversy was focused on Time Warner Cable systems, Bright House was included in the dispute, in areas where they were formerly owned by Time Warner. With both companies factored in, a total of 15 markets were affected.[10]
On December 31, 2008, Time Warner Cable and Viacom's MTV Networks had not agreed to renew any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Therefore, Time Warner and Bright House Networks would have lost all 19 Viacom channels (including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon) starting on January 1, 2009.[11][12] This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after 12 Midnight ET on January 1, 2009.[13]
In December 2009, the Fox Broadcasting Company announced that a dispute with Time Warner Cable could lead to Fox's owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from Bright House systems in the Detroit, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Gainesville markets, along with Fox's cable and sports channels in all markets served by Bright House. The carriage protests were announced shortly before Fox was to carry the Bowl Championship Series, which included the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. The dispute excluded Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and some regional sports channels, which are on separate contracts.[14][15] Shortly before the 12 midnight ET deadline on December 31, 2009, Fox granted Time Warner Cable and Bright House a brief extension during New Year's Day as talks continued, so viewers would not miss the Sugar Bowl, though the other bowl games and the NFL lineup remained at risk.[16] A settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of January 1, 2010, though no terms were disclosed; during the discussions that day, none of Fox's channels or stations were blacked out.[17]
In July 2010, ABC's parent company, Disney, announced that Disney was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable for the first time since 2000 (because Bright House Networks deals are negotiated by Time Warner Cable, Bright House customers were also affected). In Bright House-served areas, the dispute involved the Disney Channel, Disney XD, ABC Family, and all the networks of ESPN. Despite word of an early agreement on August 30, 2010,[18] it was not until the evening of the September 2 deadline that an agreement was reached between Disney and Time Warner Cable.[19][20][21]
On July 9, 2012, Hearst Television removed its stations from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal.[22] In the interim, WESH Orlando was replaced on Bright House systems in Central Florida with WBRE-TV Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a station owned by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group,[23] while other Hearst stations on Bright House were replaced with other cable channels offered by Bright House. Nexstar complained that Bright House has used WBRE's signal outside their markets without permission, while Bright House argued it was within its rights to use that station's signal as a replacement until a deal with Hearst was reached.[24] According to Time Warner Cable, the dispute stemmed from Hearst's demand of a 300% increase in its retransmission fees.[22] The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.[25]
On August 2, 2013 at 5 pm, the carriage deal between CBS and Time Warner Cable expired, with no renewal deal being reached until a month later. Time Warner had major markets affected by the blackout, while only a few Bright House markets lost access to CBS and CW stations owned by CBS Television Stations, as well as cable channels FLIX and The Smithsonian Channel; Bright House's territory includes CBSTS-owned broadcast stations Tampa CW station WTOG-TV and Detroit's WKBD-TV and WWJ-TV on their Livonia, Michigan system, which were blacked out.[26]) Premium channels Showtime and The Movie Channel, which are also owned by CBS, were similarly pulled from the cable lineup, including the corresponding Video On Demand services. Bright House said that CBS withdrew permission to air Showtime, while CBS denied that and called the blackout a "punitive" measure by TWC.[27]

Bright House Networks LLC was an American telecom company. Prior to its purchase by Charter Communications, it was the tenth-largest multichannel video service provider and the 6th largest cable internet provider (based on coverage) in the United States.[2] The company served more than 2.2 million customers.[3]
Bright House Networks' primary service offerings included digital television, high-speed internet, home security and automation and voice services.[3]
Bright House Networks also owned and operated two 24-hour local news operations; Central Florida News 13 serving the Orlando area, and Bay News 9 serving the Tampa Bay area.[4]

History[edit]
Prior to 1994, some of the systems were fully owned by Advance/Newhouse under the names Vision Cable and Cable Vision (no relation to Cablevision in the New York City metro area), while in other areas, Bright House Networks is the successor to TelePrompTer Cable TV, Group W Cable, Strategic Cable, Paragon Cable, Shaw Communications and the Tampa Bay/Orlando Time Warner Communications (previously Time Inc.'s American Television & Communications before the Time Warner merger) systems in Florida.
All of the systems that eventually came to be owned by Bright House Networks were previously owned by the Time Warner Entertainment–Advance/Newhouse Partnership. Bright House Networks, LLC was formerly known as TWEAN Subsidiary, LLC and changed its name to Bright House Networks, LLC in April 2003.[5] Under a deal struck in 2003, Advance/Newhouse took direct management and operational responsibility for a portion of the partnership cable systems roughly equal to their equity. Bright House Networks offers video, high-speed data, home security and automation and voice services. In addition, Bright House Networks operated two regional local news channels – Bay News 9 in the Tampa Bay market, and News 13 in the Orlando market. Bright House Networks had an extensive fiber optic network in the Florida area and used it to provide commercial services including dedicated Internet access, VPN services, and private network transport as well as telecom facilities such as SIP trunking and PRI service.
On March 31, 2015, Charter Communications announced it would acquire Bright House in a $10.4 billion deal, contingent on Time Warner Cable waiving its right of first refusal to acquire the latter company, which was not expected to be exercised given the then-pending Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger.[6] On May 26, 2015, after Comcast had abandoned its plans to buy Time Warner Cable, Charter announced its own plans to merge with TWC, as well as a renegotiated arrangement for the purchase of Bright House. If both deals are completed, Advance/Newhouse will gain a stake of roughly 14 percent in the combined company.[7] On April 25, 2016 regulators approved both mergers. As a result of the deal, the Bright House and Time Warner Cable brands will be phased out and eliminated completely, with both services amalgamated under Charter's Spectrum brand over the coming months.[8]
Service area[edit]
The company provided service to areas including Indianapolis, Central Florida (Orlando / Daytona Beach areas), Tampa/Lakeland area, Birmingham–Hoover area, west suburban Detroit, and Bakersfield. Most of its former business was concentrated in Central Florida.
Naming rights[edit]
Bright House Networks owns the naming rights to UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium (now Spectrum Stadium) in Orlando, Florida; Bright House Field (now Spectrum Field) in Clearwater, Florida, the spring training home of the Phillies; and the Bright House Networks Amphitheatre in Bakersfield, California. They formerly served as title sponsor of the Futures Tour Bright House Networks Open golf tournament, held in Lakeland, Florida.
Carriage disputes[edit]
When Bright House Networks was separate from Time Warner Cable, most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by Time Warner Cable.[9] Thus, Bright House customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between TWC and a content provider, which has happened several times.




Bright House Networks Spectrum



From its inception in 2003, Bright House's systems in central Florida, including Orlando, refused to carry Fox Sports Florida. This dated back to when the central Florida cable franchise was held by Cablevision, and then Time Warner Cable. As Bright House is by far the largest cable provider in central Florida, this left most of the Orlando area without most Orlando Magic games. The dispute ended in 2009, when Bright House added Fox Sports Florida to its lineup.
On September 15, 2008 Bright House temporarily dropped stations owned by the LIN TV Corporation on its Pensacola, DeFuniak Springs and Indiana systems. Affected stations were WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama, WISH-TV/WNDY-TV/WIIH-CA in Indianapolis and WANE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Even though the controversy was focused on Time Warner Cable systems, Bright House was included in the dispute, in areas where they were formerly owned by Time Warner. With both companies factored in, a total of 15 markets were affected.[10]
On December 31, 2008, Time Warner Cable and Viacom's MTV Networks had not agreed to renew any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Therefore, Time Warner and Bright House Networks would have lost all 19 Viacom channels (including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon) starting on January 1, 2009.[11][12] This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after 12 Midnight ET on January 1, 2009.[13]
In December 2009, the Fox Broadcasting Company announced that a dispute with Time Warner Cable could lead to Fox's owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from Bright House systems in the Detroit, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Gainesville markets, along with Fox's cable and sports channels in all markets served by Bright House. The carriage protests were announced shortly before Fox was to carry the Bowl Championship Series, which included the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. The dispute excluded Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and some regional sports channels, which are on separate contracts.[14][15] Shortly before the 12 midnight ET deadline on December 31, 2009, Fox granted Time Warner Cable and Bright House a brief extension during New Year's Day as talks continued, so viewers would not miss the Sugar Bowl, though the other bowl games and the NFL lineup remained at risk.[16] A settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of January 1, 2010, though no terms were disclosed; during the discussions that day, none of Fox's channels or stations were blacked out.[17]
In July 2010, ABC's parent company, Disney, announced that Disney was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable for the first time since 2000 (because Bright House Networks deals are negotiated by Time Warner Cable, Bright House customers were also affected). In Bright House-served areas, the dispute involved the Disney Channel, Disney XD, ABC Family, and all the networks of ESPN. Despite word of an early agreement on August 30, 2010,[18] it was not until the evening of the September 2 deadline that an agreement was reached between Disney and Time Warner Cable.[19][20][21]
On July 9, 2012, Hearst Television removed its stations from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal.[22] In the interim, WESH Orlando was replaced on Bright House systems in Central Florida with WBRE-TV Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a station owned by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group,[23] while other Hearst stations on Bright House were replaced with other cable channels offered by Bright House. Nexstar complained that Bright House has used WBRE's signal outside their markets without permission, while Bright House argued it was within its rights to use that station's signal as a replacement until a deal with Hearst was reached.[24] According to Time Warner Cable, the dispute stemmed from Hearst's demand of a 300% increase in its retransmission fees.[22] The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.[25]
On August 2, 2013 at 5 pm, the carriage deal between CBS and Time Warner Cable expired, with no renewal deal being reached until a month later. Time Warner had major markets affected by the blackout, while only a few Bright House markets lost access to CBS and CW stations owned by CBS Television Stations, as well as cable channels FLIX and The Smithsonian Channel; Bright House's territory includes CBSTS-owned broadcast stations Tampa CW station WTOG-TV and Detroit's WKBD-TV and WWJ-TV on their Livonia, Michigan system, which were blacked out.[26]) Premium channels Showtime and The Movie Channel, which are also owned by CBS, were similarly pulled from the cable lineup, including the corresponding Video On Demand services. Bright House said that CBS withdrew permission to air Showtime, while CBS denied that and called the blackout a "punitive" measure by TWC.[27]

Bright House Networks LLC was an American telecom company. Prior to its purchase by Charter Communications, it was the tenth-largest multichannel video service provider and the 6th largest cable internet provider (based on coverage) in the United States.[2] The company served more than 2.2 million customers.[3]
Bright House Networks' primary service offerings included digital television, high-speed internet, home security and automation and voice services.[3]
Bright House Networks also owned and operated two 24-hour local news operations; Central Florida News 13 serving the Orlando area, and Bay News 9 serving the Tampa Bay area.[4]

History[edit]
Prior to 1994, some of the systems were fully owned by Advance/Newhouse under the names Vision Cable and Cable Vision (no relation to Cablevision in the New York City metro area), while in other areas, Bright House Networks is the successor to TelePrompTer Cable TV, Group W Cable, Strategic Cable, Paragon Cable, Shaw Communications and the Tampa Bay/Orlando Time Warner Communications (previously Time Inc.'s American Television & Communications before the Time Warner merger) systems in Florida.
All of the systems that eventually came to be owned by Bright House Networks were previously owned by the Time Warner Entertainment–Advance/Newhouse Partnership. Bright House Networks, LLC was formerly known as TWEAN Subsidiary, LLC and changed its name to Bright House Networks, LLC in April 2003.[5] Under a deal struck in 2003, Advance/Newhouse took direct management and operational responsibility for a portion of the partnership cable systems roughly equal to their equity. Bright House Networks offers video, high-speed data, home security and automation and voice services. In addition, Bright House Networks operated two regional local news channels – Bay News 9 in the Tampa Bay market, and News 13 in the Orlando market. Bright House Networks had an extensive fiber optic network in the Florida area and used it to provide commercial services including dedicated Internet access, VPN services, and private network transport as well as telecom facilities such as SIP trunking and PRI service.
On March 31, 2015, Charter Communications announced it would acquire Bright House in a $10.4 billion deal, contingent on Time Warner Cable waiving its right of first refusal to acquire the latter company, which was not expected to be exercised given the then-pending Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger.[6] On May 26, 2015, after Comcast had abandoned its plans to buy Time Warner Cable, Charter announced its own plans to merge with TWC, as well as a renegotiated arrangement for the purchase of Bright House. If both deals are completed, Advance/Newhouse will gain a stake of roughly 14 percent in the combined company.[7] On April 25, 2016 regulators approved both mergers. As a result of the deal, the Bright House and Time Warner Cable brands will be phased out and eliminated completely, with both services amalgamated under Charter's Spectrum brand over the coming months.[8]
Service area[edit]
The company provided service to areas including Indianapolis, Central Florida (Orlando / Daytona Beach areas), Tampa/Lakeland area, Birmingham–Hoover area, west suburban Detroit, and Bakersfield. Most of its former business was concentrated in Central Florida.
Naming rights[edit]
Bright House Networks owns the naming rights to UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium (now Spectrum Stadium) in Orlando, Florida; Bright House Field (now Spectrum Field) in Clearwater, Florida, the spring training home of the Phillies; and the Bright House Networks Amphitheatre in Bakersfield, California. They formerly served as title sponsor of the Futures Tour Bright House Networks Open golf tournament, held in Lakeland, Florida.
Carriage disputes[edit]
When Bright House Networks was separate from Time Warner Cable, most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by Time Warner Cable.[9] Thus, Bright House customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between TWC and a content provider, which has happened several times.




Bright House Networks Spectrum



From its inception in 2003, Bright House's systems in central Florida, including Orlando, refused to carry Fox Sports Florida. This dated back to when the central Florida cable franchise was held by Cablevision, and then Time Warner Cable. As Bright House is by far the largest cable provider in central Florida, this left most of the Orlando area without most Orlando Magic games. The dispute ended in 2009, when Bright House added Fox Sports Florida to its lineup.
On September 15, 2008 Bright House temporarily dropped stations owned by the LIN TV Corporation on its Pensacola, DeFuniak Springs and Indiana systems. Affected stations were WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama, WISH-TV/WNDY-TV/WIIH-CA in Indianapolis and WANE-TV in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Even though the controversy was focused on Time Warner Cable systems, Bright House was included in the dispute, in areas where they were formerly owned by Time Warner. With both companies factored in, a total of 15 markets were affected.[10]
On December 31, 2008, Time Warner Cable and Viacom's MTV Networks had not agreed to renew any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Therefore, Time Warner and Bright House Networks would have lost all 19 Viacom channels (including Comedy Central and Nickelodeon) starting on January 1, 2009.[11][12] This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after 12 Midnight ET on January 1, 2009.[13]
In December 2009, the Fox Broadcasting Company announced that a dispute with Time Warner Cable could lead to Fox's owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from Bright House systems in the Detroit, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Gainesville markets, along with Fox's cable and sports channels in all markets served by Bright House. The carriage protests were announced shortly before Fox was to carry the Bowl Championship Series, which included the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. The dispute excluded Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network and some regional sports channels, which are on separate contracts.[14][15] Shortly before the 12 midnight ET deadline on December 31, 2009, Fox granted Time Warner Cable and Bright House a brief extension during New Year's Day as talks continued, so viewers would not miss the Sugar Bowl, though the other bowl games and the NFL lineup remained at risk.[16] A settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of January 1, 2010, though no terms were disclosed; during the discussions that day, none of Fox's channels or stations were blacked out.[17]
In July 2010, ABC's parent company, Disney, announced that Disney was involved in a carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable for the first time since 2000 (because Bright House Networks deals are negotiated by Time Warner Cable, Bright House customers were also affected). In Bright House-served areas, the dispute involved the Disney Channel, Disney XD, ABC Family, and all the networks of ESPN. Despite word of an early agreement on August 30, 2010,[18] it was not until the evening of the September 2 deadline that an agreement was reached between Disney and Time Warner Cable.[19][20][21]
On July 9, 2012, Hearst Television removed its stations from Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks systems when the parties failed to reach a deal.[22] In the interim, WESH Orlando was replaced on Bright House systems in Central Florida with WBRE-TV Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a station owned by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group,[23] while other Hearst stations on Bright House were replaced with other cable channels offered by Bright House. Nexstar complained that Bright House has used WBRE's signal outside their markets without permission, while Bright House argued it was within its rights to use that station's signal as a replacement until a deal with Hearst was reached.[24] According to Time Warner Cable, the dispute stemmed from Hearst's demand of a 300% increase in its retransmission fees.[22] The substitutions lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.[25]
On August 2, 2013 at 5 pm, the carriage deal between CBS and Time Warner Cable expired, with no renewal deal being reached until a month later. Time Warner had major markets affected by the blackout, while only a few Bright House markets lost access to CBS and CW stations owned by CBS Television Stations, as well as cable channels FLIX and The Smithsonian Channel; Bright House's territory includes CBSTS-owned broadcast stations Tampa CW station WTOG-TV and Detroit's WKBD-TV and WWJ-TV on their Livonia, Michigan system, which were blacked out.[26]) Premium channels Showtime and The Movie Channel, which are also owned by CBS, were similarly pulled from the cable lineup, including the corresponding Video On Demand services. Bright House said that CBS withdrew permission to air Showtime, while CBS denied that and called the blackout a "punitive" measure by TWC.[27]
