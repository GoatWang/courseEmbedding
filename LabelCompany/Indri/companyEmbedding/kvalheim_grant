Mottahedeh & Company is a company in New York City that makes tableware and decorative accessories. The company has made porcelain for the President of the United States, the U.S. State Department and the Diplomatic Corps.[citation needed] The company, over 85 years old, was purchased from the Mottahedeh estate in 1992 by Wendy and Grant Kvalheim with a minor partnership with Jeffrey and Pamela Mondschein. Mildred Mottahedeh continued to collaborate at Mottahedeh for five more years and died in February, 2000. Today Wendy Kvalheim is the CEO and Design Director of the company. Mottahedeh is the recognized leader in antique reproductions and adaptations in luxury ceramics, primarily hard porcelain, and metals. It specializes in Chinese Export porcelain and early European porcelain. It holds licenses with Metropolitan Museum of Art, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Historic Charleston Foundation, Mount Vernon Ladies Association, Winterthur Museum and Gardens, and Tony Duquette, and has a history of working with many more. The most recent license is with National Geographic Society.[1]
The qualities that distinguish Mottahedeh porcelains are a large selection of complex shapes produced in small quantities, clarity of body both in bright white and historic gray body, and delicate, bold, and complex colors. The industry average for colors is 4 to 8. Mottahedeh starts with 4 and may use as many as 27, with the average number of colors on an item being 16. The original inspirations were made for kings and nobility in a non-industrial age. Mottahedeh products are primarily manufactured in Europe, with the largest production in Portugal. Mottahedeh hard porcelain items are durable and can be placed in the dishwasher and oven.[citation needed]
The company manufactures and/or distributes these brands of tableware and decorative accessories: Mottahedeh, R. Haviland & C. Parlon, Jars, and Milestone by Mottahedeh.[citation needed]

Applications Are Available Today!
As you know, each and every year BILLIONS of dollars are awarded to people and organizations, in the form of free-money and other types of funding. This money comes from all different sources including but not limited to state and federal agencies and through private corporations and foundations. Most people know this money exists, but just don't know where to apply, how much they qualify for, or even where to get an application. 
Incidentally, the amount of money given away by these entities each year can vary as well as the time of the year 
			that the money is given away, so it's important to check the date the application is due and when the money will be 
			distributed.  Many people think this money is given out at the beginning of the calendar year, and this is not the rule. Some entities give out money several times a year or even all year long depending on who is eligible and who is not. 

As you know our country has bailed out banks, investment firms, and other failing businesses in recent years. You need to also know that they are not the only ones giving out money. There are thousands of private corporations and foundations, who have money to help individuals and small businesses, too, through different types of funding programs! Funding programs have eligibility criteria, which an applicant must meet before a funding application will even be considered. USA Grant Applications was designed to give you the help you need to locate and apply for these funds because if you are like most Americans, you just don't know where to start.


				"It's fast and easy and well worth it."
				--Ciara

Here are some of the categories of assistance given away by these different organizations through all different types of programs:

Small and large business ventures including start-up and expansion
Real estate ventures including rehab, repair, low-cost housing, rentals, and hundreds of other real estate-related investments
Inventions
Community development
Historical building restoration
Medical research
Education
First-time home purchase
And many others!



				"This website is easy to use since everything is outlined perfectly and easy to figure out."
				--Edgar

Don't worry about your present financial situation. Funding applications do not require collateral, credit checks, 
			security deposits or co-signers. You can apply even if you have a Bankruptcy. Also remember that government funding is not available for personal expenses or paying off debt but there may be other assistance programs out there to help you out of your situation!
Get your piece of the big funding pie. Start the Application Process Now! Don't wait. 
			The money you need may be given to your neighbor, if they qualify!

To provide you with the online training on how to apply for this funding and the support that you need to to successfully pursue your funding goals, we charge a small up-front fee to cover the marketing and advertising of this site as well as to pay our funding writer to provide the most up-to-date information on the funding world. The small fee is $29.95 an extremely fair price to pay for the wealth of online resources and application sources we provide. With your small registration fee, you will receive instant access to our members-only application sources site.
Our membership fee also comes with a GUARANTEE which states: If you apply for funding using one of the applications you find on our website and you don't receive funding, your membership fees will be refunded to you immediately. All you have to do is provide us with the name of the funding opportunity you applied for and a copy of the rejection letter you received from the funder. You will have 90 days from the date of this transaction to submit your refund request along with your denial letter.


				"It was easy and straight forward to use"
				--Danielle

Don't read any further if you are not sincerely interested in securing Funding Money. We don't want to take your money if this is something you really don't want to do. There is a lot of time and money put into searching out these applications, and we want you to be sure you are as serious about getting your share of this money as we are about giving you this information. Remember, you must qualify for the different funding programs listed on this site in order for you to receive funding and because we are not a funder, we can not guarantee that you will qualify or receive funding!
The sad news is most people never apply for any kind of funding because they just don't know "how" or "who" to apply to, not to mention the fact that they think it is too hard. It may be easier than you may think, but you will never know until you try, so what are you waiting for? Sign up today.
