Life[edit]




Lasila manor, Estonia, where von Baer spent his early childhood


Karl Ernst von Baer was born into a Baltic German noble family in the Piep estate, Kreis Jerwen, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Lääne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia.[1][2][3][4] Many of his ancestors had come from Westphalia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu), each of which he found lacking in quality education. In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to "finish" his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and Würzburg, where Ignaz Döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.
In 1817, he became a professor at Königsberg University (Kaliningrad) and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to Königsberg. In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834–46) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846–62). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in Königsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867–76) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a leading critic of Charles Darwin.[5]

Embryology[edit]
See also: Recapitulation theory
von Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig[7][8]). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova.[9][10] Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.[11]
von Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:

General characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics.
General structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear.
The form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms, but separates itself from them.
The embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form, such as one less evolved, but only its embryo.

Evolution[edit]
From his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early phylogenetic tree revealing the ontogeny and phylogeny of vertebrate embryos.[12]
In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

"Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form."[13]

Baer was also a believer in a teleological force in nature which has been compared to a form of evolutionary orthogenesis.[14][15]
Other sciences[edit]




K. Baer, 1865


The term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a North-South direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect,[16] while in an East-West section there is no preference.
Baer was interested in the northern part of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837, collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to the Caspian Sea, the North Cape, and Lapland. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.[17]
He was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
In 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[18] He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869–1876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society.[19][20][21][22] In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23]
Legacy[edit]
A statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. Before the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of Arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840.[24] A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.

Life[edit]




Lasila manor, Estonia, where von Baer spent his early childhood


Karl Ernst von Baer was born into a Baltic German noble family in the Piep estate, Kreis Jerwen, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Lääne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia.[1][2][3][4] Many of his ancestors had come from Westphalia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu), each of which he found lacking in quality education. In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to "finish" his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and Würzburg, where Ignaz Döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.
In 1817, he became a professor at Königsberg University (Kaliningrad) and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to Königsberg. In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834–46) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846–62). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in Königsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867–76) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a leading critic of Charles Darwin.[5]
Contributions[edit]

Embryology[edit]
See also: Recapitulation theory
von Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig[7][8]). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova.[9][10] Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.[11]
von Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:

General characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics.
General structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear.
The form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms, but separates itself from them.
The embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form, such as one less evolved, but only its embryo.

Evolution[edit]
From his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early phylogenetic tree revealing the ontogeny and phylogeny of vertebrate embryos.[12]
In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

"Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form."[13]

Baer was also a believer in a teleological force in nature which has been compared to a form of evolutionary orthogenesis.[14][15]
Other sciences[edit]




K. Baer, 1865


The term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a North-South direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect,[16] while in an East-West section there is no preference.
Baer was interested in the northern part of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837, collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to the Caspian Sea, the North Cape, and Lapland. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.[17]
He was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
In 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[18] He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869–1876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society.[19][20][21][22] In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23]
Legacy[edit]
A statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. Before the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of Arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840.[24] A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.

Karl Ernst von Baer was born into a Baltic German noble family in the Piep estate, Kreis Jerwen, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Lääne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia.[1][2][3][4] Many of his ancestors had come from Westphalia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu), each of which he found lacking in quality education. In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to "finish" his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and Würzburg, where Ignaz Döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.
In 1817, he became a professor at Königsberg University (Kaliningrad) and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to Königsberg. In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834–46) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846–62). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in Königsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867–76) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a leading critic of Charles Darwin.[5]
Contributions[edit]

Embryology[edit]
See also: Recapitulation theory
von Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig[7][8]). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova.[9][10] Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.[11]
von Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:

General characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics.
General structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear.
The form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms, but separates itself from them.
The embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form, such as one less evolved, but only its embryo.

Evolution[edit]
From his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early phylogenetic tree revealing the ontogeny and phylogeny of vertebrate embryos.[12]
In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

"Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form."[13]

Baer was also a believer in a teleological force in nature which has been compared to a form of evolutionary orthogenesis.[14][15]
Other sciences[edit]




K. Baer, 1865


The term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a North-South direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect,[16] while in an East-West section there is no preference.
Baer was interested in the northern part of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837, collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to the Caspian Sea, the North Cape, and Lapland. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.[17]
He was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
In 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[18] He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869–1876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society.[19][20][21][22] In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23]
Legacy[edit]
A statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. Before the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of Arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840.[24] A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.

Life[edit]




Lasila manor, Estonia, where von Baer spent his early childhood


Karl Ernst von Baer was born into a Baltic German noble family in the Piep estate, Kreis Jerwen, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day Lääne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia.[1][2][3][4] Many of his ancestors had come from Westphalia. He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu), each of which he found lacking in quality education. In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to "finish" his education. In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book. After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and Würzburg, where Ignaz Döllinger introduced him to the new field of embryology.
In 1817, he became a professor at Königsberg University (Kaliningrad) and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to Königsberg. In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834–46) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846–62). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in Königsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867–76) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a leading critic of Charles Darwin.[5]
Contributions[edit]

Embryology[edit]
See also: Recapitulation theory
von Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book Über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig[7][8]). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova.[9][10] Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.[11]
von Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:

General characteristics of the group to which an embryo belongs develop before special characteristics.
General structural relations are likewise formed before the most specific appear.
The form of any given embryo does not converge upon other definite forms, but separates itself from them.
The embryo of a higher animal form never resembles the adult of another animal form, such as one less evolved, but only its embryo.

Evolution[edit]
From his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early phylogenetic tree revealing the ontogeny and phylogeny of vertebrate embryos.[12]
In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:

"Von Baer, towards whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect, expressed about the year 1859... his conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution, that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single parent-form."[13]

Baer was also a believer in a teleological force in nature which has been compared to a form of evolutionary orthogenesis.[14][15]
Other sciences[edit]




K. Baer, 1865


The term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a North-South direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect,[16] while in an East-West section there is no preference.
Baer was interested in the northern part of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837, collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to the Caspian Sea, the North Cape, and Lapland. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.[17]
He was a pioneer in studying biological time – the perception of time in different organisms.
Awards and distinctions[edit]
In 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[18] He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869–1876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society.[19][20][21][22] In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23]
Legacy[edit]
A statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. Before the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of Arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840.[24] A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.

Car manufactures design vehicle systems that are adequate for the average driver. If you drive your car harder than average you will over tax the systems, especially the brakes. Precise application of braking is essential for competitive lap times, even in short events like auto cross and track-day competitions.
For 43 years Baer Brakes has participated in every type of racing and performance activity. Thru Racing, Baer Brakes first recognized the need for improvements in brakes for street performance vehicles. Baer is the brand most recognized among serious performance vehicle owners because they work better and deliver the best performance value.
Below is a brief overview of Baer's brake systems:
SS4+ (Front) - Designed for 15" wheels (perfect for RestoMods and restorations where modern brakes are a must. This system features our S4 (4 piston caliper) on an 11" 2-pc rotor.
SS4 (Rear) - Designed for 16" (and some 15" wheels) this is the same looking caliper as the SS4+ front but mounted to a 12" 1-pc rotor with a drum in hat park brake.
SS4+ (Rear) - Designed for 17" or larger wheels, this is a perfect match to the Pro+ or Ext+ front (as a more affordable rear package). The SS4+ features a 13" 2-pc rotor and drum in hat park brake.
Track4 (Front)- Designed for 17" or larger wheels. The Track4 features our larger T4 caliper mounted to a 13" 1-pc rotor. The Track4 works great with the S4 rear.
Pro+ (Front or Rear) - Designed for 17" or larger wheels (available in front or rear, and in 13" or 14" rotors). This is the first offering that we have that you can get the EXACT same look front and rear.
Extreme (Front or Rear) - This is our largest brake offering and features a 2618 Forged monoblock caliper mounted to a 14" 1-pc rotor. The Extreme is available in front or rear (for that EXACT same look), but only for a few select applications. Most of our Extreme offerings are Extreme+ (2-pc rotors).

DecelaRotor and DecelaPads
DecelaRotors

Today's open wheel designs have made brakes a critical element in creating a "finished performance appearance"!
In answer Baer developed DecelaRotors as premium OE replacement rotors with slotted, crossdrilled and plated surfaces.
First crossdrilling, then slotting, originated from a need developed in the early days of disc brakes in road racing. The purpose is to provide gasses that build up between the rotor and pad surface an exit path. If left unaddressed the "out-gassing" of pads generate a pneumatic barrier between the rotor and the pad, effectively reducing friction and with it braking performance. These gasses are generated when elements used in manufacturing pads reach extreme temperatures frequently experienced in racing.
Today's compounds and burnishing techniques in manufacturing have largely eliminated the effects of out-gassing in modern pads. The engineers at Porsche, Mercedes, Ferrari and others have this knowledge, however racing appearance and heritage that is visually evident with crossdrilled rotors is a f inishing touch that delivers satisfying esthetics.
Each hole drilled in a Baer DecelaRotor is carefully located ventilated rotors. This minimizes potential surface fissures (cracks) and maintains proper rotor balance.
Some competitors imply or directly state, "slotting does not generate an increase in stress to the surface of the rotor like crossdrilling does".
This is simply not true!
Any machine modification to rotor surfaces creates a stress riser. Baer backs DecelaRotor with the industries best warranty, which itself is backed by Baer's 15+ year reputation for delivering premium brake products to satisfied customers.
Many also imply or state outright, "slotted or drilled rotors deliver significant performance stopping improvements".
Quantifiable stopping improvements are generated from increasing brake torque. Increasing leverage (larger dia rotors), increased clamping force (caliper upgrades) or improving friction itself (higher mu pad compound) are the commonly accepted ways to attain bolt-on improvements in braking performance.
Baer's factual assessment of the features and benefits available from DecelaRotors include:

Dynamic Visual Impact
Superior Bite
Equalized Pad Wear
Consistent Wet Weather Performance
Direct OE Replacement
Proper Counter-Rotational Drill & Slot pattern as used in Pro-Racing.
Eliminates Outgassing
Unprecedented three-year limited warranty against warping & cracking!

Decelapads

are ceramic matrix pads. Benefits common to ceramics include:

Low noise (under 10-DBA)
Light colored nonabrasive dust
Excellent response cold & hot
Highly temperature stable

However, DecelaPads stand out against competitive ceramics as the highest-friction level (.45-mu) ceramic pad currently available! In addition DecelaPads exhibit:

Excellent onset bite
Smooth progressive modulation
Long pad life
Low rotor wear

Smooth quiet, lower levels of light colored dust and friction levels rivaling European specification high carbon content compounds, DecelaPads deliver. When matched with DecelaRotors they are the perfect compliment of brilliant appearance and user friendly performance!


Full Floater












Problem: Traditional flanged-axles employ a single axle-bearing and together they support the weight of the vehicle, when corning the flanged-axle is levered by lateral forces. Axle deflection, "bowing" or "bending" occurs as lateral forces rise with cornering speeds.
Affects: "Knock Back" results when the axle flange and the brake rotor to which it is attached deflect causing the rotor to "knock" the pad "back" displacing brake fluid in the caliper pistons(s). The driver must then pump the pedal to move the fluid back into the caliper and re-establish the firm brake pedal.
SOLUTION: BAER'S TRACKER FULL FLOATING AXLE CONVERSION
Though we didn't invent the floater, we were the first to refine it for the Pro-Touring market. This was built completely from the ground up for street cars, and is 100% USA built. Some key features with our floater conversion compared to other common race pieces are:

Much narrower footprint! Only 5/8" wider than our normal Ford 9" brake system
Smaller register to fit street type wheels
Standard car patterns (5x4.75 and 5x4.5)
FIRST EVER floater to incorporate park brake!
Fully ABS compatible for Ford and GM configurations
Drive plates built by Speedway Engineering specifically for Baer that uses a 24 spline arrangement 
based off the Nascar specs. (Our 24 spline drive plate is .050 larger than a standard 35 spline axle!
ARP ½ x 20 race studs

The Tracker (Full Floating axle conversion) is purchased as an upgrade to a variety of our brake systems. When the tracker is purchased it does not include any brake parts, just the parts needed for the floater conversion. The Tracker will work with: 

Extreme+ 14" and 15"
Pro+ 13" and 14"
SS4+ 13"



The Floater snout has a flange machined into it to allow any of the above systems with late model Big Ford ends (Torino) to bolt right to the snout. Once the snout is installed this is a complete bolt on! You do not need to weld any brake brackets on the rear end! If you have an existing brake system with a backing plate other than Torino, new plates will need to be ordered.


Once the snout is installed this is a complete bolt on! You do not need to weld any brake brackets on the rear end! If you have an existing brake system with a backing plate other than Torino, new plates will need to be ordered.
Here is an example of the difference in width of our Tracker rear conversion compared to a traditional 9" rear brake system:



Spacers




CNC machined out of 6061-T6 aluminum
Available in a wide variety of thicknesses (from .250-1.00")
Available in a wide variety of bolt patterns to cover many car and truck applications.
Fully machined to ensure flat surface 9/16" stud holes, not a universal slot hole patterns like many of the cheaper cast spacers
100% MADE IN USA with US sourced material





Tracker Tie Rod Complete Kits

Trackers (Baer outer Tie Rod ends)

Machined and heat treated Chrome Moly pin. Correct pin taper per application, NO drilling on spindles required
6061-T6 Machined outer sleeves anodized black
High quality teflon lined heim joints
¾" shim adjustment to correct bumpsteer issues.

Lowering a vehicle or altering its caster and/or camber can lead to unsafe driving conditions, commonly called "bump steer." Simple maneuvers, such as hard braking, cornering or traveling over road-surface irregularities, can cause the vehicle to dart in an unexpected direction. Baer Trackers™ solve this problem! The pin-height-adjustable tie rods allow compensation for ride height and suspension geometry changes, enabling a more optimal range of articulation between the tie rod and the steering arm. Steering geometry is optimized and bump steer is eradicated.
Kits are listed for stock vehicle applications, for modified vehicles go to builder components where individual pins and sleeves (with dimensions) are available to match your needs.


Tracker Tie Rod Complete Kits

Changing a vehicle's ride height causes changes in suspension caster angles which can dramatically affect steering. Instead of steering remaining stable and returning to center easily, simple bumps in the road may cause your suspension to articulate differently than it was designed to. Front wheels may hop dramatically to the left or to the right as a result, and ride quality can be compromised in both the front and rear. Baer's Tracker Tie Rod End joints compensate for ride height changes to allow more freedom of movement between your vehicle's tie rods and steering arms. Because of the greater flexibility and range of articulation the end joints add, optimal steering stability and control is restored. T-6 aluminum construction ensures high strength, and Teflon-coated sockets back the long-lasting durability of these end joints with smooth, noise-free operation.

Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)












      
          By Kimberly A. Buettner
Published: 2007-10-31
Keywords: Biography, Epigenetics, Preformationism
 Karl Ernst von BaerBest known for his contributions to the field of 
		embryology, Karl Ernst von Baer also pursued a variety of other areas of study including medicine, botany, zoology, and anthropology.  Committing his life to scientific research, von Baer’s work led to the advancement of the understanding of mammalian reproduction, development, and organ functioning.  His embryological discoveries ultimately led him to a view of development that supported 
		epigenesis and refuted long-held thinking about 
		preformation.
Karl Ernst von Baer was born on 28 February 1792 in Piep, Estonia, to first cousins Juliane Louise von Baer and Magnus Johann von Baer.  As one of ten children, von Baer spent his childhood in Coburg with his father’s brother Karl and his wife, Baroness Ernestine von Canne.
Although his uncle and father encouraged military life, von Baer chose to attend the 
		University of Dorpat, where he began medical studies in August 1810.  At Dorpat, von Baer studied botany, physics, and physiology, and was influenced by professor of physiology Karl Friedrich Burdach.  After completing his MD degree in September 1814, von Baer traveled to Berlin and Vienna to continue his education.  In 1815 he proceeded to Würzburg to further his medical studies and there he met physiologist and anatomist Ignaz Döllinger as a result of his interest in botany.  From 1815–1816 von Baer studied comparative anatomy with Döllinger, who encouraged him to research the development of the 
		chick.  However, von Baer was unwilling or unable to spend the time and money necessary to pursue this area of study and instead returned to Berlin during the winter of 1816–1817 to train in practical anatomy.
In August 1817 von Baer became a prosector in anatomy in Königsberg at the invitation of Karl Friedrich Burdach.  In 1819 he became Extraordinary Professor of Anatomy and in 1826 Ordinary Professor of Zoology.  During his time in Königsberg, von Baer taught zoology, anatomy, and anthropology, founded a zoological museum, acted as director of the botanical gardens, and served as dean of the medical faculty and as rector of the university.
Most of von Baer’s contributions to embryology were from 1819–1834 while at Königsberg.  During this time, he returned to the study of embryology and made considerable advances in the understanding of extraembryonic membrane development and function in the 
		chick and in mammals.  In this work he built on the results of research he had carried out collaboratively in Würzburg with 
		Christian Heinrich Pander, as well as on 
		Pander’s own work on 
		chick embryology.  Karl Ernst von Baer also introduced the term 
		“spermatozoa”, for what had previously been referred to as “animalcules” in the seminal fluid, which he believed to be parasites.  In 1826 von Baer discovered mammalian eggs in the ovary of Burdach’s 
		dog, completing a search that began centuries before.
Drawing a number of conclusions from his work on developing embryos, von Baer emphasized that development is 
		epigenetic, proceeding from homogeneous to heterogeneous matter, which he felt made preformationist ideas no longer plausible.  He encapsulated his thinking into four statements that are now known as 
		“von Baer’s Laws.”  The first law says that the general features of a large group of animals appear earlier in the embryo than the special features.  The second law says that less general characters are developed from the most general, and so forth, until finally the most specialized appear.  The third law is that instead of passing through the stages of other animals, each embryo of a given species departs more and more from them.  Finally, the fourth law concludes from the previous three that the embryo of a higher animal is never like the adult of a lower animal, but only like its embryo.
After the death of his brother Louis, von Baer returned with his family to St. Petersburg to retain the family estate.  He then entered the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg as a Full Member in Zoology in December 1834 after refusing previous offers while in Königsberg.  After working at the academy as a librarian, academician, and professor of anatomy and physiology, von Baer retired from active membership in 1862 but continued to work as an honorary member until 1867.  After returning to Dorpat, von Baer died on 28 November 1876.
