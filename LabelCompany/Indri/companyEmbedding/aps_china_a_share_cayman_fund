China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

Investment Philosophy







Overpaying for a stock is one of the greatest investment risks. It can be managed by developing an intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioAPS’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research, rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses. Our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since APS’ founding in 1995.Investigative Research, Beyond Bottom-UpAsian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by 1) experienced local investment professionals and 2) probing research. We conduct on-site visits; field investigations including interviews with former employees, competitors, suppliers, industry specialists and other stakeholders; and verification of information and data with independent sources. The extensive, granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock, conduct due diligence and think independently of consensus.Rigorous ValuationDuring some market cycles, investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly. Thus, tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retail-dominated Asian markets. Instead, portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alpha-diversified strategies (please see our explanation of alpha groups in the Alpha Groups & Generation section ). Our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth, and whether the listed price reflects that worth. The key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals. Sell DisciplineWe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when: 1) prices run ahead of fundamentals; 2) initial assumptions are proven wrong; 3) there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company. Redefining RiskIn our view, there are risks greater than volatility, such as overpaying for a security vis-à-vis its fundamentals. That is why we examine every stock inside-out before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles, political fluctuations, regulatory changes, structural events, management changeovers, among others.We also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of high-conviction stocks, which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations. Our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind. Only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time, and as appropriate, in order to earn an illiquidity premium. Competitive Advantages From APS’ Investment Approach1. Our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process. It goes beyond bottom-up research. 2. When the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve, we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions, without being influenced by market noise.3. This knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when less-informed investors irrationally run for the exit, revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets.

Alpha Groups







APS’ portfolios are “alpha diversified” for optimal alpha generationEvery stock in our portfolios is classified under 1 of 4 alpha groups: Structural alpha stocks possess structural strengths and/or core competencies and will likely outperform over the longer term. The investment horizon is normally more than 3 years.Dynamic alpha stocks are subject to cyclical factors such as troughs and peaks in sectors such as semi-conductor, property and airlines. The investment horizon is about 2 years. Economic alpha stocks are undervalued; they have a healthy earnings growth rate yet trade at a large discount to intrinsic value. The investment horizon is 1-3 years.Opportunistic alpha stocks are experiencing special events such as restructuring, product repositioning, mergers and acquisitions, etc. The investment horizon is relatively short, at 6-12 months.

iShares Europe ETF (IEV) – (Cash) – Daily
Near Term Trend: Bullish / NeutralFriday’s Close: 45.24 (- 0.59%)UPDATE: Last week, I suggested holding shorts until IEV approached $42.65 and covering / buying there. I suggested shorting if IEV bounced to $44.90.European stocks rallied past the $44.90 projected resistance – indicating the door is open to more upside. I’m thinking there will be a test of recent high near $46 and then a drop to $43.85.Short up near $46 and try buying near $43.85. Upside target will be $48 for buys made at $43.85.

SINGAPORE and NEW YORK, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- APS Asset Management and Rothschild Asset Management Inc. have entered into a strategic alliance. The strategic alliance seeks to strengthen APS' position in the US and Rothschild Asset Management's position in Asia.  








"In the old world of asset management, companies competed with each other. But in this new world we believe asset managers with complementary skills will form strategic alliances to create value for their clients," says Wong Kok Hoi, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of APS. "We at APS are delighted to collaborate with such a reputable firm who shares the same vision with us. We complement each other in product and geographical coverage as well as people."
This alliance also involves general marketing which Rothschild Asset Management will extend to APS in the US. In Asia, APS will extend similar support to Rothschild Asset Management. 
"We are thrilled to be partnering with a uniquely positioned Asian asset manager in APS," states Rothschild Asset Management CEO Michael Woods. "This partnership allows us to leverage APS' network in Asia, while also accessing the niche expertise of a leading investment manager in one of the fastest growing regions of the world." Mr Wong says, "Rothschild Asset Management is a US asset manager with strong US products. We are privileged to partner with Rothschild Asset Management, a firm which shares so many similar attributes with APS – specialized, nimble and alpha-focused. Together, we can serve our clients better by leveraging our complementary strengths."
APS Asset Management is a Singapore-headquartered boutique asset management firm founded in 1995 by its CIO, Wong Kok Hoi. The firm has assets under management of USD2.7 bn as at 31 May 2017, which are invested across Asia including Japan equity markets. The firm's investors are mainly North American and European institutional asset owners, financial institutions and other sophisticated investors. 
APS manages both segregated mandates and co-mingled funds. The two largest funds are the APS China A Share (Cayman) Fund, with an AUM of about USD230 mn, and the APS Asia Pacific Long Short (Cayman) Fund with an AUM of about USD460 mn as at end-May 2017. The firm's China A-share strategy totals about USD2 bn and the long/short equity strategy totals about USD510 mn as at 31 May 2015. 
APS has six offices worldwide in Singapore, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, Tokyo and New York. For more information, please visit www.aps.com.sg
Headquartered in New York, Rothschild Asset Management Inc. manages investments covering a range of U.S. securities including large-cap, small/mid-cap, small-cap, and smart beta solutions. The firm seeks to provide superior performance while controlling risk. Rothschild's seasoned teams of investment professionals use a disciplined investment philosophy and an integrated process focused on fundamentals. The firm manages assets for a broad range of clients including corporations, endowments, foundations, healthcare organizations, high-net-worth investors, public pension funds, sub-advisory and Taft-Hartley plans.
