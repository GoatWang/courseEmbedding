CLEANSPARK TURNS  EXPENSES INTO INCOME

Through the power of clean, affordable energy.

 

 
 
 
 
 









We are writing you today because we are desperate and need your company, CleanSpark’s urgent intervention. We heard from the National Government that your company has cutting edge energy storage and microgrid technology that can be deployed to generate electricity for our hospitals.
-Ramugmo R.S. (Tshilidzini Hospital Board Chairman)

 

 
 





CleanSpark’s system has performed beyond expectations
-Becky Holeman  (Ram’s Hill CFO)

 

 
 





We believe that CleanSpark can substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
-Scott Jackson (President and CEO of Global Impact)

 

 
 





We see the market for renewable energy generation plus storage positioned for exponential growth, and an impactful new period of adoption, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. CleanSpark’s technology integrates multiple energy generation assets with the broadest array of energy storage solutions.
-Rick Tallman (CEO of Renova)

 

 
 





The system architecture is elegant, flexible, scalable and best possible system architecture to control a multivendor microgrid.
-National Utility Participant

 

 
 





The result was possibly the most advanced microgrid/smart building project in the world.
-Jim Young (Co-founder & CEO RealComm)

 

 
 





Your individual technologies are far ahead of the known market, and together have the potential to change the face of the current microgrid and energy industry.
-Capt. W.L. Bill Whitmire (Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton)

 

 
 





This is the first thing in the microgrid space that is not pretend.
-Toby Considine (President TC9, Inc.)

INVESTOR RELATIONS
CleanSpark seeks to enhance shareholder value not only through exceptional business performance and practices, but also through responsible and effective communication with its shareholders. The latest company information relevant to the individual and institutional investor includes stock price and history, upcoming events and presentations and financial documents. CleanSpark is traded on the OTC under the ticker symbol CLSK.
OVERVIEW
Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generators and advanced technologies into outdated electrical systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, and campuses across the world are turning to virtual power plants and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety.
