What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Announces the Delivery of the M/V 'Akadimos,' as Well as New Charters for the M/T 'Active' and M/T 'Anemos I' and a Charter Extension for the M/T 'Atrotos,' Each at Increased Day RatesMarketwiredJune 15, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareATHENS, GREECE--(Marketwired - Jun 15, 2015) - Capital Product Partners L.P. (  NASDAQ :  CPLP ) (the 'Partnership'), an international diversified shipping company, announced today the successful acquisition of the M/V 'Akadimos,' as well as new time charter employment for the M/T 'Active' and M/T 'Anemos I' and a charter extension for the M/T 'Atrotos,' each at increased day rates.Delivery of M/V 'Akadimos'Pursuant to the Master Vessel Acquisition Agreement we entered into on July 24, 2014, the Partnership took delivery on June 10, 2015 of the M/V 'Akadimos' (115,145 dwt / 9,288 teu, Eco-Flex, Wide Beam Containership built 2015, Daewoo-Mangalia Heavy Industries S.A.), the second of five vessels (the 'Dropdown Vessels') that we have agreed to acquire from our sponsor, Capital Maritime & Trading Corp. ('Capital Maritime'). In connection with the acquisition of the Dropdown Vessels, we paid to Capital Maritime the amount of $30.2 million as an advance payment for all five vessels in September 2014. The $81.5 million purchase price for the M/V 'Akadimos' was funded through a drawdown of $40.75 million under the Partnership's senior secured credit facility with ING Bank N.V. (the 'ING Facility') and available cash, including from the proceeds of previously completed equity offerings. The M/V 'Akadimos' is chartered to CMA-CGM S.A. for five years (-30/+90 days) at a gross daily charter rate of $39,250.Further to the Master Vessel Acquisition Agreement, the Partnership expects to acquire an additional three vessels from Capital Maritime, which comprise two newbuild 9,288 teu, eco-flex, wide beam containerships under construction at Daewoo-Mangalia Heavy Industries S.A. with expected deliveries in August and November 2015 and an additional eco MR product tanker under construction at Samsung Heavy Industries (Nigbo) Co. Ltd. with expected delivery at the end of June 2015. The two containerships are scheduled to enter into five-year time charter employment to CMA-CGM S.A. and the MR product tanker is scheduled to enter into two-year time charter employment to Capital Maritime. The acquisition of the remaining Dropdown Vessels is expected to be funded from the proceeds of previously completed equity offerings, drawdowns under the ING Facility and the Partnership's cash balances. In addition, the Partnership has a right of first refusal over six newbuild eco medium range product tankers built by Samsung Heavy Industries (Nigbo) Co. Ltd.Charter RenewalsThe M/T 'Active' (50,000 dwt, IMO II/III Eco Chemical/Product Tanker built 2015, Samsung Heavy Industries (Nigbo) Co. Ltd.) has been chartered to Cargill International S.A. ('Cargill') for a period of two years (+/- 30 days) at a gross daily rate of $17,700. The vessel was previously employed with Capital Maritime at a gross rate of $17,000 per day plus 50/50 profit share. Capital Maritime has agreed to terminate its existing charter earlier, in order for the vessel to commence its employment with Cargill in early June 2015. The earliest redelivery under the new charter is in May 2017. This new charter marks a new time charter relationship with Cargill and further diversifies the Partnership's counterparties.The M/T 'Anemos I' (47,782 dwt, Ice Class 1A IMO II/III Chemical/ Product Tanker built 2007, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Ltd., South Korea) will continue its time charter employment with Capital Maritime for an additional year (+/- 30 days) at $17,250 gross per day upon completion of its current charter. The vessel is presently earning $14,850 gross per day under its time charter with Capital Maritime which expires in mid-June 2015. The earliest redelivery under the new charter is in May 2016.Both the M/T 'Active' early charter termination for re-employment with Cargill and the M/T 'Anemos I' new charter to Capital Maritime were unanimously approved by the Conflicts Committee of the Partnership.Finally, Capital Maritime exercised an option under its current charter of the M/T 'Atrotos' (47,786 dwt, Ice Class 1A IMO II/III Chemical/ Product Tanker built 2007, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Ltd., South Korea) to extend its employment for an additional year at a daily gross rate of $15,250, which represents an increase of $500 per day compared to its previous day rate. As a result, the earliest charter expiration has been extended to April 2016.Read MoreAs a result of the above charter renewals, the Partnership's charter coverage for 2015 and 2016 increased to 95% and 72%, respectively.About Capital Product Partners L.P.Capital Product Partners L.P.
