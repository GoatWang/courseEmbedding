You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

History[edit]
PC Connection, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Patricia Gallup and David Hall. The co-founders met while serving as a support crew to hikers on the Appalachian Trail.[5]
The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]
In March 1998, the company completed its Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PCCC.[8]
In September 2016, the company announced a corporate rebranding. The "Connection" brand unites all subsidiaries (PC Connection, GovConnection, MoreDirect, and Softmart) under one brand name. NASDAQ stock ticker changes from PCCC to CNXN.[9]

Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Connection purchased ComTeq Federal, a Maryland-based company serving the computing needs of federal government agencies, including the Navy, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the National Security Agency, and Internal Revenue Service.[12] Renamed GovConnection, Inc., the subsidiary serves all government and education customers.
In January 2000, Connection announced the agreement to acquire Merisel Inc. in alliance with its initiative to add infrastructure.[13]
In 2002, Connection acquired MoreDirect, a Florida-based IT solutions provider specializing in Web-based eProcurement.[14]

History[edit]
PC Connection, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Patricia Gallup and David Hall. The co-founders met while serving as a support crew to hikers on the Appalachian Trail.[5]
The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]
In March 1998, the company completed its Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PCCC.[8]
In September 2016, the company announced a corporate rebranding. The "Connection" brand unites all subsidiaries (PC Connection, GovConnection, MoreDirect, and Softmart) under one brand name. NASDAQ stock ticker changes from PCCC to CNXN.[9]
Locations[edit]
In addition to its corporate headquarters in Merrimack, NH, PC Connection, Inc. has sales and support offices in Keene and Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Rockville, Maryland; Dakota Dunes, South Dakota; Boca Raton, Florida; Shelton, CT; Downingtown, PA, and Schaumburg, IL.[10] The company operates a 268,000-square-foot distribution and fulfillment complex, equipped with an ISO 9001 certified technical configuration lab, in Wilmington, Ohio.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Connection purchased ComTeq Federal, a Maryland-based company serving the computing needs of federal government agencies, including the Navy, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the National Security Agency, and Internal Revenue Service.[12] Renamed GovConnection, Inc., the subsidiary serves all government and education customers.
In January 2000, Connection announced the agreement to acquire Merisel Inc. in alliance with its initiative to add infrastructure.[13]
In 2002, Connection acquired MoreDirect, a Florida-based IT solutions provider specializing in Web-based eProcurement.[14]
In 2005, Connection purchased the business and selected assets of Amherst Technologies, Inc., a New Hampshire-based IT provider.[15]
In 2011, Connection acquired ValCom Technologies, a technology services company in the Chicago metropolitan area.[16]
In 2016, Connection acquired Softmart, a Microsoft Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) and global supplier of technology, tools, and service solutions.[17]
In 2016, Connection acquired GlobalServe.

											Patricia Gallup replied to Ernie's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			I REALLY hope you had permission from Dr. G's family to write such personal information about him. Otherwise please remove this post, as there have been problems with rumors in the past and I don't think this forum is the place to continue to spread them.  What I do hope is people respect his request for PRIVACY and let him get through this horrible time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Per the forum rules: Hi everyone! Our forum guidelines have been updated to include the sentence, "Please do not post information regarding anyone else's health without first obtaining that person's permission." Thanks for your cooperation. Michelle

Sicko On Dvd



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to lthomas521's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			Thank you for this post, as I had seen the movie in the theater and felt comfortable discussing it with everyone and singing its praises everywhere, except a place like here, because it so saddens me when people make comments on subjects without actually SEEING the film.  My wish is that people would put their political beliefs aside, as I most certainly did and was never a fan of Michael Moore, until he made this movie with purely altruistic intent, and simply WATCH the film before discussing it. I believe this should be required viewing for college students, if not everyone, as it's a true eye opener.

For Those Of You With Tubes



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to dizzygirl's topic in Chit-Chat Forum






			I also responded in your other post in the other forum.  Hope your doctor gets back to you because as I said my daughter has been getting tubes an average of twice a year for a decade or so and never has pain after procedure or any of the symptoms you are describing. In fact she actually looks forward to getting her tubes because of the relief they give. She has hearing loss that she doesn't feel is made better when the tubes are in, except she doesn't get the congestion she is susceptible to without the tubes, which makes her hearing worse.  Perhaps it's because there is only one tube in that your ears are a bit "off balance" if that makes any sense?

Hearing Loss



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to dizzygirl's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			My daughter gets tubes in her ears everytime she flies and when her allergies are bad about twice a year. She has eustucian tube disorder due to POTS and EDS and had chronic ear and throat infections as a child that have completely stopped since getting the tubes in.  She gets them in office, no anesthesia, absolutely nothing but alcohol to sterilize her ears which makes her dizzy only during the procedure due to the smell. If this is so painful I would highly suggest a different ENT as she's been doing this over a decade and never has pain or prolonged problems after insertion. And even insertion is not "fun" for her but no big deal anymore as they bring her such relief a few minutes of pain is nothing compared to not having the tubes.  She also has about 30% hearing loss but no reason was given for this. I'm glad you decided to try them dizzygirl as I believe I suggested them to you before as they have been such a Godsend to my daughter. Hope they work for you. I wonder why they are only doing one at a time? My daughter doesn't think they'd have any effect on her if she only had one since it's an equal problem in both ears.

Pet Food Recall



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to Jacquie802's topic in Chit-Chat Forum






			If anyone is curious enough to read some books about the manufacturing of pet foods, 2 excellent books are Raw Meaty Bones by Tom Lonsdale; and Food Pets Die For by Ann N. Martin.  In my personal opinion, and not trying to shove that down anyone's throats, just giving info I have found very informative, I wouldn't feed my pets any brand of food that didn't comply with AAFCO standards, as they really look to protect what goes into the food and how it's produced. For example many would be shocked what can be construed by many companies as meat by-product (a very common ingredient in pet foods AND treats), and road kill is allowed!  Also I feel if you are buying cheap food for your pets, you're getting what you pay for, and that isn't much. Many trainers and experts recommend paying the most you can with a reputible company to ensure your pets are getting what's best for them. Foods that are AAFCO approved are not hard to find, nor do I feel they are extravagent costs to ensure they meet the proper nutrition of what we consider family members.   Furthermore, if you DO want to make your own dog foods, some excellent recipe books, and food and treats that comply with AAFCO, come from Three Dog Bakery link: http://www.threedog.com/, they have the Three Dog Bakery Cookbook link: http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearc...p;pwb=1&z=y as well as Cooking The Three Dog Bakery Way: http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearc...18190&itm=1 that have been approved by our dogs, as well as extended family and friends' pets, and making pet treats are excellent homemade gifts in my opinion too! So sorry and sick about all these pet losses, and hope they get to the bottom of the problem soon, because it seems the recalls are going to keep coming. From the AAFCO.org website what they're about: The term AAFCO stands for the Association of American Feed Control Officials. A basic goal of AAFCO is to provide a mechanism for developing and implementing uniform and equitable laws, regulations, standards and enforcement policies for regulating the manufacture, distribution and sale of animal feeds; resulting in safe, effective, and useful feeds. The Association thereby promotes new ideas and innovative procedures and urges their adoption by member agencies, for uniformity.  Purpose and Function of AAFCO: The purpose of the corporation shall be to establish and maintain an Association through which officials of any state, dominion, federal or other governmental agency and employees thereof charged with a responsibility in enforcing the laws regulating the production, labeling, distribution, or sale of animal feeds or livestock remedies may unite to explore the problems encountered in administering such laws, to develop just and equitable standards, definitions and policies to be followed in enforcing such laws, to promote uniformity in such laws, regulations and enforcement policies, and to cooperate with members of the industry producing such products in order to promote the effectiveness and usefulness of such products.

I'm Really Bothered By The Experience...



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to cardiactec's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			I am sorry to say cardiactec, I feel that statements you are making about ssris widely contribute to the stigmas attached to mental illness and that truly saddens me. I hope you realize that anxiety, anorexia, and the others you mentioned ARE ALSO DISEASES like POTS, and perhaps doctors aren't ALL the "she must be depressed or anxious" diagnosers that you are implying, maybe they are trying their best to help someone with a hard case. For those that say they'd never ever try an SSRI, I agree with those who say they'd rather TRY to feel better, and as Katherine said MANY do feel better, than have one, or a few, medications listed on their history they are using off-label.  Please explain to me why all the top ANS docs in the WORLD prescribe these meds, do they really think we're all anxious and depressed? I think not, I think it's because what happens in our bodies happens to mirror what happens to people who have panic attacks. And even IF our physical ailments cause us to have depression or anxiety WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH THAT? My daughter and myself have tried the SSRI's and my daughter the SSNRI's without success, but that doesn't mean we believe the docs think we're anxious and depressed, it means we wanted to feel better, and if one would've worked I would gladly take it daily. We also seek counseling for living with chronic illness and could care less that it's in our medical records. We are sick, and seeking help to learn to cope and ways of getting through daily life in a society where illnesses are thought of as weakness is something I'm PROUD to have in my medical record because it shows the great lengths I'm willing to go through to be as functioning and healthy as I can be. It actually makes me wonder from a psychological standpoint why some are so paranoid about what's in their medical record, and as I said just really sad that sick people attach stigmas to other sick people.  Cardiactec you have even said you fear the next time passing out, don't you find that to be similar to being anxious? My daughter has been passing out since she was 8, she has never stopped living life because she FEARS something that might not happen on any given day, and if she does pass out, it happens, she has POTS.  I am just so baffled that someone "who works in the medical field and knows how it works" would make such statements that are so negative to people who deal with depression and anxiety, as well as those who take those meds to help with their POTS. I am shocked that YOU seem to be one of those who is NOT "POTS literate" if you believe they are "throwing anxiety and depression medications at any ailment they don't understand" since these medications are in studies to prove they work for POTS, AND the most "POTS literate" docs in the world prescribe them daily.  My daughter and I use Procrit OFF-Label with GREAT success for our POTS, I wonder if you have any idea how many tens of millions of dollars it takes to get FDA approval for an add-on usage to a medication? Would you not take Procrit because you fear being labeled as a cancer patient? Because that is a disease just like anxiety and depression is? I am just personally glad that my family shares the philosophy that we'd rather try ANYTHING to FEEL BETTER than worry what others think.

Does Dr. Grubb Require Referrals?



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to Leigh's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			You need a referral from another doctor calling Dr. Grubb's office on your behalf, stating that you have dysautonomia, or strongly suspected to have it, and they will set up the appointment if he will/can see you. Expect to wait 8 months for an appointment with Dr. Grubb, you could try to get an appointment with his NP, Bev, that may get you in sooner, but I assume you still need a call made on your behalf.

Things Are Bad



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to Dizzy Dame's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			I'm very sorry for your situation.  In addition to the other great suggestions I wanted to suggest you look into Hospice Care, if your local hospice has the funding, in addition to end of life care, they may deal with chronic illness support. I believe it depends on the resources they have available, but I wanted to suggest them if the other suggestions don't help. Many people are not aware of the other services Hospice can offer.  I hope you find the support you need to get through this. Also if you have local friends, you may not want to ask for help for fear of being a burden, but many times people are looking for ways to help, they just don't want to overstep boundries or push themselves upon us, and if you ask, they may be delighted.

Pain Is Getting Extreme



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to Maxine's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			Yes it is amazing what Pain Management, Physical Therapy, exercise, medication, the power of positive thinking, and good counseling to deal with anger issues, can do for bodies like ours--IF you actually DO the things doctors advise you to do, long term.  Myself and my daughters Joint Hypermobility would not be under control if not for exercise, and out of 13 PT's between us through the years and injuries, we've only met one PT who was not aware of EDS. And my daughter has a Pain Management Specialist who manages her severe pain, and keeps her functioning quite well even working to find two medications that work through her severe medication intolerances to allow her to be pain free, even while exercising. Also I think it's important for EVERYONE to remember this is a public forum available to anyone for reading. Whatever you post here is available on searches such as google by user name or topic. While it is sad that people who don't have dysautonomia choose to join, and trolls exist, anyone can read ANYTHING you write here. This INCLUDES doctors, nurses, people who work for social security, and family members.  Good Luck in finding the help you need, and following through with that help. "Can't lives on won't street."

How Do You Know If Your Having A Pots Episode Or If It's An Anxiety Attack?



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to DSM3KIDZ's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			As a POTS patient without anxiety I can say I don't ever fear leaving home or get super nervous during an episode. I don't take any meds for POTS and myself and my daughter are fainters but staying home doesn't get us anywhere in life healthwise. I can pass out at home (and do) just as simply as I can pass out at the grocery store or the gym (done those too).  I think--What's the WORST that can happen if I do this or that? I pass out and may wake up with a group of strangers around me who usually want to help. And usually I'm out with friends or family who know about my health and understand if I suddenly sit on the ground, or must always have water, or need to eat immediately, or if I do pass out.  In my personal opinion passing out, (or having tachycardia, facial flushing, sweating) isn't the worst thing to happen in one's life. There is a huge difference in NEEDING to stay home, and being afraid to leave. I have plenty of times where my bp is too low, or I'm too dizzy, or have a migraine that it's just stupid to go out. But when you're a mom, you're generally the person who needs to get stuff done, visit the library, do the grocery shopping, get the dry cleaning, etc. etc. Not that I don't have help if I ask, but I truly don't mind doing these things.  If I'm invited somewhere I haven't been I try it out. Again, the worst that can happen is I pass out. Some bad things like being somewhere too loud, or too hot, or too crowded, or too long of wait can also happen, but I try to enjoy my time, and don't go back if it's too much. Or sit outside and wait if I can't tolerate it.  I don't want to minimize my symptoms, passing out and feeling POTSy doesn't feel good, it really, really stinks. But I'm going to do it at home, as quickly as I do it in public, so I don't feel the need to miss out on life. I get myself prepared to leave by eating right, and drinking plenty. I always leave with water and salty snacks. And I'm realistic about what I can do. I don't go out one day a week and attempt all our family errands. I go out when I can for smaller trips, and if I'm going to be gone for the day or week. I eat accordingly when I'm out and don't try and mess with things I know I can't tolerate so I don't jeopardize my time away. One of the reasons our family loves taking vacations so much is the "Stranger Effect" we can pretty much make fools of ourselves by passing out in different locations, my daughter has the ability to throw up almost anywhere, and chances are we're NEVER going to see those people again. Maybe we can even educate some strangers on dysautonomia.  I certainly prefer risking embarrassment over turning my family into hermits anyday. I have a close friend with social anxiety disorder that came out of nowhere, and she says Paxil gives her the ability to not worry about other people around her. Or small problems in her own life that used to be blown up in her mind, and has stopped all her panic attacks. I know her husband appreciates having his care-free wife back too because he says she wasn't good at "hiding" it at all. I hope you're able to find the right counseling, therapy, medication, for any of you dealing with this.

National Organization Of Rare Diseases



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to briarrose's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Steph! I appreciate you made the trip, AND spoke your mind! My daughter would LOVE to do exactly what you are doing when she gets older. I was wondering about your comments about all the rare disorders in the room, and IF there is anything they are doing/planning that brings "us" ALL together? Though I certainly wouldn't fault any group for wanting funding for their OWN research, I agree completely with what you said about the large number of people, and how LOUD they could be together, instead of apart. Thanks again, it means a lot to us!

Birth Control



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to Lukkychrm42's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			My daughter and myself (both POTS) take Yasmin with NO side effects what-so-ever like lisa. We read about it from past posts here, and our respective doctors both suggested it due to low hormone amounts, and for my daughter, the anti-acne side effects. My family believes low hormones are definitely better with regards to POTS, and our docs, including Dr. G aren't worried about our use of Yasmin at all.  Hope you find something that works.

Is It Ok To...



							
								
									
										
											Patricia Gallup replied to gillian502's topic in Dysautonomia Discussion






			I don't mean to offend you gillian but you are indeed asking for medical advice and I personally believe that is a very dangerous thing to do. Doctors prescribe meds based on a firsthand knowlege of their patient, usually their height, weight, and sometimes BMI are involved, your dose has been tailored to fit YOU, not a bunch of strangers who have their own body types and reasons for being prescribed meds.  I'm sorry if I feel that you probably had time to call your doctor and chose instead to ask medical advice about a PRESCRIPTION medication on the internet. I would also be very wary of messing with any medication, doctor advised or not, while leaving for a 4 hour car ride knowing how sensitive most of our bodies are to medication. I probably would've at least tried the extra dose some other day, IF I had my doctor's permission, to see how I'd react. If your doctor is only giving you "by-the-book" responses than perhaps it's time to find a POTS specialist, an online public forum is NO SUBSTITUTE for proper medical advice.  Hope your trip goes well and you get in touch with your dr. or on call dr. if you feel the need to add more medication.

			What a stunningly beautiful home!! Your husband is clearly quite talented! The environment thanks you too!  Love the pics! We look forward to seeing pics of your daughter's first slumber party and puppet shows (in a couple years)!

We wish you many decades of happiness in your new home and town!  Thanks for sharing!

“A better way to buy information technology products.” That's what Patricia Gallup and David Hall had in mind when they founded our company in 1982. Seeing a significant business opportunity in the emerging personal computer industry, the two entrepreneurs launched their direct computer supply business with the philosophy that providing technical advice and focusing on customer service was as important as low prices. Using their personal savings, they purchased $8,000 of inventory, placed a 1/9th-page ad in Byte Magazine, and took their first step on the road to unprecedented growth and innovation. As the magazine hit the newsstands, they waited two long days for the telephone to ring. On the third day, it started ringing. It hasn't stopped since. 

A Continuing Commitment to Service
Before the first phone call was answered, Gallup and Hall planned to create a business culture designed to provide exemplary service and build long-term customer relationships. This strategy has proved to be very successful and remains a key component of our mission. Since its inception, our company has been credited with many direct marketing service innovations, and has received many awards for customer service and dedication. 

Some of the programs our experts pioneered established industry standards while raising the expectations of today’s technology shoppers. Some of our innovations include:

Toll-free technical support before, during, and after the sale
Everything Overnight®: most orders placed as late as 7:00 p.m. ET are delivered the next business day 
One-Minute Mail Order®: incoming orders can be filled in under one minute through instant electronic access to customer records 
Custom configuration
