Under Articles 63 and 64 of Decree no. 41,019, dated February 26, 1957, the assets and facilities used mostly in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of power are attached to these services and cannot be withdrawn, sold, assigned, or
mortgaged without the prior written consent of the regulatory agency. ANEEL Resolution no. 20/1999 regulates the release of assets from the concessions of the Public Electric Energy Utilities, granting prior authorization to the release of assets
that are deemed useless to the concession, when intended for sale, provided that the proceeds from such transaction be deposited in a special bank account assigned to investment in the concession. 

Financial charges and interest on loans from third-parties for investments in construction in progress have been recorded through transfers to Property, Plant, and Equipment in Progress, for a total of R$ 2,495 in 2009 (Note 17).

Property, Plant,  and Equipment 

Â Â Â Â Â Our principal properties consist of the generation, transmission and distribution facilities described in ÂBusinessÂGeneration and Purchasers of EnergyÂ and ÂÂBusinessÂTransmission and
Distribution.Â  Of the net book value of our total property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2008 (including construction in progress),
generation and transmission facilities represented 49.7%, distribution facilities represented 29.8%, telecommunications represented 2.6%, supply of gas represented 2.2%, Elejor represented 8.1% and UEG AraucÃ¡ria thermoelectric plant
represented 7.6% . We believe that our facilities generally are adequate for our present needs and suitable for their intended purposes.
