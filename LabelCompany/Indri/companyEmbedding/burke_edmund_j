Overview



No conservative library is complete without the thought of Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism. This is the most comprehensive anthology of his works and speeches. Peter J.

Meet the Author



Edmund Burke (1729-1797) was a British statesman and political philosopher best known for his support of the American Revolution and denouncement of the French Revolution. Burke's work has become essential to understanding the early development of the United States. He is also considered the philosophical founder of modern conservatism.Peter J. Stanlis (19202011) was Distinguished Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, at Rockford College and a world authority on Edmund Burke. He wrote several books about Burke, including Edmund Burke and the Natural Law which included an introduction by longtime friend and leading figure in the philosophical development of conservatism, Russell Kirk, who is most famous for The Conservative Mind. Stanlis was appointed to the National Council on the Humanities by President Reagan in 1982.

Description


Additional Information



Product Description
Edmund Burke (c.1729-1797), orator, philosophical and political writer, British statesman, and opponent of the revolution in France, is among the most famous of eighteenth century Irishmen.  Two centuries after his death, however, his legacy is still contested, both in Ireland and abroad.  This is the first collection of essays to focus exclusively on Burke’s complex relationship to his native Ireland.  The book brings together thirteen authors, both established experts and young scholars, from a wide variety of viewpoints and disciplines.  The contributors discuss Burke’s early years in the Blackwater Valley and in Ballitore, his experiences at the University of Dublin and as a Dublin journalist, his relationship to Irish history and aesthetics, his friendship with fellow Irishman Oliver Goldsmith, his numerous Irish links after he began his parliamentary career, his views on Irish politics and the Irish constitution, his thoughts on Ireland and India, the idea of union and political economy, religion and the Irish reception to his anti-revolutionary writings.
