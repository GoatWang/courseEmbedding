Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. Supplies Products for the Retrofit of School Buses in Northern California


VENTURA, Calif., Oct. 13, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDTI) ("Clean Diesel"), a cleantech emissions reduction company, announced today that its Heavy Duty Diesel Systems division has received nearly $1.3 million in new orders for its verified (approved) emission reduction products under the California Air Resources Board's Lower-Emission School Bus Program to be used in the retrofitting of Northern California school buses. Shipments and revenue recognition began 
in the third quarter and are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2011.
The orders were received from Emissions Retrofit Group, a key distributor of Clean Diesel's ECS-branded emission reduction products. The orders consist primarily of Purifilter® Plus diesel particulate filter (DPF) emissions reduction systems.  This hybrid DPF system employs both passive and active regeneration and is verified by the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board. Reducing harmful emissions from school buses is an important step in reducing children's exposure to harmful effects of toxic particulate matter emissions. Clean Diesel's Purifilter® Plus reduces diesel particulate matter by more than 85% and is ideally suited for the retrofit of school buses providing a 
simple plug-in regeneration that can be executed mid-day, resulting in minimal interruption to a typical school bus schedule.
Peter Tuckerman, President of Emissions Retrofit Group, said, "The School Bus Program is a demanding and critical application for DPF technology, requiring extensive collaboration between our companies.  The Purifilter® Plus system has been an ideal solution for the retrofit of school bus fleets and has consistently delivered the trouble-free utilization results we expect. We have chosen to offer this line of products for their exceptional efficiency, quality and durability."
"Purifilter® Plus is a critical member of the Purifilter® family of products, aimed at satisfying the ongoing regulatory demands for emissions reduction," said Lyndon Smith, Vice President and General Manager of Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. "The combination of our technology solutions and the abilities of our trained distributors and installers enables us to satisfy our customers' needs, as represented by the School Bus Program. We are delighted to improve the environment through the deployment of our products."
About Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. Clean Diesel is a vertically integrated global manufacturer and distributor of emissions control systems and products, focused on the heavy duty diesel and light duty vehicle markets. Clean Diesel utilizes its proprietary patented Mixed Phase Catalyst (MPC®) technology, as well as its ARIS® selective catalytic reduction, Platinum Plus® fuel-borne catalyst, and other technologies to provide high-value sustainable solutions to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency and lower the carbon intensity of on- and off-road engine applications. Clean Diesel is headquartered in 
Ventura, California, and currently has operations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Japan and Sweden. For more information, please visit www.cdti.com.
About the Lower-Emission School Bus ProgramThe primary goal of the Air Resources Board's Lower-Emission School Bus Program is to reduce schoolchildren's exposure to both cancer-causing and smog-forming pollution. The program provides grant funding for new, safer school buses and to put air pollution control equipment (i.e., retrofit devices) on buses that are already on the road.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
