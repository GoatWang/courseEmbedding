History[edit]
Capgemini was founded by Serge Kampf in 1967[7] as an enterprise management and data processing company. The company was inaugurated as the Société pour la Gestion de l'Entreprise et le Traitement de l'Information (Sogeti).

In 1973 Sogeti acquired a majority stake in its major European IT services competitor, CAP (Centre d'Analyse et de programmation).[8]
In 1974 Sogeti acquired Gemini Computers Systems, a US company based in New York.[9]
In 1975, having made two major acquisitions of CAP and Gemini Computer Systems, and following resolution of a dispute with the similarly-named CAP UK over the international use of the name 'CAP', Sogeti renamed itself as CAP Gemini Sogeti.[9]
In 1981, Cap Gemini Sogeti launched US operations following the acquisition of Milwaukee-based DASD Corporation, specializing in data conversion and employing 500 people in 20 branches throughout the US. Following this acquisition, The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.[10]
In 1986, Cap Gemini Sogeti acquired the consulting division of US-based CGA Computer to create Cap Gemini America.[11]
In 1991, Gemini Consulting was formed through the integration of two management consulting firms (United Research and The MAC group)[9]
In 1995, the Center for Business Innovation at Cap Gemini was transformed from an institutional university model to a networked research capability under the leadership of its Director Christopher Meyer (author)[12][13]
In 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini with a new group logo. All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini.[9]
In 2000, Cap Gemini acquired Ernst & Young Consulting. It simultaneously integrated Gemini Consulting to form Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.[14]
In 2002, Cap Gemini re-launched its Sogeti brand, creating a new legal entity bearing the original name of the company, headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The new company is focused on delivering IT services to a more limited range of markets.
In 2003, the firm acquired Transiciel and merged the two practices into Sogeti-Transiciel (later consolidated within Sogeti in 2006).[15]
In April 2004, the Group reverted to Capgemini (its current name).[16]
In the summer of 2005, due to heavy financial losses, Capgemini sold its North American healthcare consulting practice, including both payer and provider practices, to Accenture but retains its life sciences practice.[17]
In August 2006, Capgemini acquired Future Engineering.[18]
In September 2006, Capgemini acquired a 51% shareholding in Unilever India Shared Services Limited (Indigo), a provider of financial shared services and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance services to the global Unilever Group. Indigo has operating centres in Bangalore and Chennai and employs approximately 600 staff.[19]
In October 2006, Capgemini agreed to acquire Kanbay International for US$1.2 billion in cash ($29 per share). The acquisition increased Capgemini's India staff to 12,000+(which is grown to 26,000+ in mere 4 years of time) employees. The current India employee strength on 23 October 2012 is 40,000[20] The acquisition was completed on 8 February 2007.
On 8 February 2007, Capgemini announced the acquisition of Software Architects, a US-based consulting company, to expand its US business.[21]
On 25 July 2008, Capgemini announced the acquisition of Getronics PinkRoccade Business Applications Services BV[22] of the Netherlands. The acquisition amounted to an equity value of €255 million paid in cash.
In October 2008, Capgemini acquires UK Test specialist Vizuri.[23]

Q1 2017: Capgemini starts the year on a solid footing.pdf



        Media relations:Florence LièvreTel.: +33 1 47 54 50 71florence.lievre@capgemini.com Investor relations:Vincent BiraudTel.: +33 1 47 54 50 87vincent.biraud@capgemini.com Q1 2017: Capgemini starts the year on a solid footing Paris, April 26, 2017 - Capgemini Group achieved consolidated revenues of €3,171 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 2.8% year-on-year at constant exchange rates*.  For Paul Hermelin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini Group: "We start the year on a solid footing. Our revenue growth of 2.8% in Q1 is driven by a strong momentum in Continental Europe and an improved performance in North America. Financial Services and Manufacturing - which together account for nearly half of the Group's revenues - show growth rates close to 10%. This reflects our ability to support key market players in their digital transformation. In addition, a strong level of bookings confirms the good start to the year. Digital and Cloud grew 24% year-on-year and now account for 32% of our revenues. We completed three focused acquisitions this quarter, aimed at further expanding our portfolio in these areas and bringing innovative and end-to-end digital solutions to our clients: Idean, a digital design firm based in Palo Alto, Atlanta-based TCube Solutions, specialized in Duck Creek Technologies insurance software and Itelios, an omni-channel e-commerce expert. We are also investing in our automation platforms and our global production centers to accompany our clients in their drive to improve competitiveness.  By continuing to implement our strategic priorities, we demonstrate our ability to achieve all our objectives for 2017, the year of Capgemini's 50th anniversary."          (In millions of euros)     Change         Q1 2016  Q1 2017     As reported  At constant exchange rates*  At constant exchange rates and Group scope*  Revenues    3,092    3,171           +2.6%      +2.8%      +2.6%     Q1 revenues totaled €3,171 million, up 2.6% year-on-year on a reported basis. At constant exchange rates*, revenue grew 2.8% after adjusting for the Brazilian equipment resale business which is being discontinued. OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS Consulting Services (4% of Group revenues), driven by growth in Continental Europe and fueled by digital transformation demand, reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.6% at constant exchange rates. Technology & Engineering Services (16% of Group revenues) grew 5.0% at constant exchange rates, progressing across all Group regions, with a return to growth in France amplified by the positive impact of the number of working days this quarter. Application Services (61% of Group revenues) benefitted from a strong market demand for digital and cloud-based application offerings and continue to drive Group momentum, with revenue growth of 5.3%. Other Managed Services (19% of Group revenues) reported revenues down by 7.6%. This is entirely attributable to Infrastructure Services which continue to be impacted by the anticipated decline in the UK public sector. Business Services (Business Process Outsourcing and platforms) are stable in Q1. OPERATIONS BY MAJOR REGION In Q1, as planned, North America began to restore its growth momentum, with revenues almost stable year-on-year, at -0.2% at constant exchange rates, a marked improvement on the -3.1% reported in Q4 2016. In this region, the Energy & Utilities sector confirmed its path to recovery, with a third quarter of sequential revenue stability, while the Financial Services sector enjoyed good momentum and the Manufacturing sector strengthened. The United Kingdom and Ireland reported a revenue decline of 7.6% at constant exchange rates, reflecting the anticipated decline in the public sector while private sector remains healthy. France grew 5.2%, with almost 10% increase in Financial Services and Manufacturing, as well as in the consumer sectors (Commerce, Distribution, Telecom, etc.). The Rest of Europe enjoyed revenue growth of 7.8%, with around 10% increase in Germany, Scandinavia and Italy and positive growth in Benelux. Finally, the Asia-Pacific and Latin America region grew 13.6%, with activity slightly down in Latin America (excluding the Brazilian equipment resale business) and strong growth in Asia-Pacific. HEADCOUNT At March 31, 2017, the Group's total headcount stood at 195,800, up 7% year-on-year, with 111,300 employees in offshore centers (57% of the total headcount).  BOOKINGS Bookings totaled €3,001 million in Q1 2017, down 3.2% at constant exchange rates on Q1 2016 which benefited from the renewal of a major multi-year contract in the UK public sector. OUTLOOK FOR 2017 For 2017, the Group forecasts revenue growth at constant exchange rates of 3.0%, an operating margin of 11.7% to 11.9% and organic free cash flow generation in excess of €950 million. In addition: The Group expects the impact of currency movements on revenues to be limited on a full year basis, with the impact of the pound sterling depreciation against the euro offsetting notably the appreciation of the US dollar and the Brazilian real;The Group has decided to discontinue its equipment resale activity in Brazil, which represented approximately €60 million in 2016. In order not to disrupt the analysis of quarterly trends, organic growth and growth at constant exchange rates are presented after removing this activity from 2016 and 2017 revenues;The impact of acquisitions on revenue growth is estimated at this stage to be a few tens of basis points.

The Group scope and exchange rates used are those for the published fiscal year. Exchange rates for the published fiscal year are also used to calculate growth at constant exchange rates.  As announced on the publication of the outlook for 2017, to ensure that the discontinuation of equipment resale activities in Brazil does not disrupt the analysis of quarterly trends, organic growth and growth at constant exchange rates will be presented after removing this activity from 2016 and 2017 revenues.  Growth rates reconciliation  Organic   growth   +2.6%    Changes in Group scope         +0.2pt    Growth   at constant exchange rates  +2.8%    Exchange rates fluctuations      +0.2pt    Current   growth  +3.0%    Activities being   discontinued      -0.4pt    Reported   growth  +2.6%  The impact from currencies is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian real, the US dollar and the Canadian dollar and the depreciation of the pound sterling. The impact of discontinued activities is linked to evolution of the equipment resale business in Brazil, which in the first quarter of 2016 represented 18 million euros at the reported rate.
