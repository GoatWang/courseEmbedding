Process | Colchester Global Investors Limited





















Skip to main content

      Toggle navigation       INVESTMENT PROCESS Investment Value is at the core of Colchester's investment process. It is the synthesis of "Real Value" and "Financial Stability" assessed across countries, currencies, sectors, duration and maturity. Real Value is captured by our estimates of the expected real yield - the real return after subtracting the impact of expected inflation from nominal yields. This is underpinned by a robust inflation forecasting framework based on time proven, quantitatively oriented methodologies and the judgment of our experienced investment team. The determinants of Financial Stability - economic deficits and surpluses, monetary conditions and policy objectives - are appraised via a combination of rigorous analytical methods and experienced judgment. This methodology provides an integrated framework within which all fixed income assets we invest in can be appraised on a consistent basis.Currency management primarily serves to preserve the value found in country bond markets. We believe that from time to time, excellent return-enhancing currency opportunities can be identified by looking for extremes in the value of real exchange rates. Therefore, real exchange rates are the main focus of the firm's currency research efforts, supplemented by current account and fiscal balance analysis.

Philosophy | Colchester Global Investors Limited





















Skip to main content

      Toggle navigation       INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH At the heart of Colchester's value-oriented philosophy is the belief that investments should be valued in terms of the income they will generate in real terms. Our approach is based on the analysis of inflation, real interest rates and real exchange rates supplemented by an assessment of sovereign financial balances. Portfolios are constructed to benefit from those opportunities with the greatest relative investment potential for a given level of risk.Colchester's portfolios principally comprise sovereign bonds. The firm eschews corporate credit, believing instead that its broader sovereign opportunity set provides sufficient diversity and return potential to add value without resorting to lower credits. In addition, currency risk is managed in a primarily defensive fashion, attempting to take full advantage of long-term currency valuation extremes.
