Volunteer Profile: University of Missouri Curator Warren Erdman 

High-Profile Inconspicuous Board
Outside academia, few people understand the role and responsibilities of the nine-member University of Missouri Board of Curators. In fact, most would struggle to name a board member. That is, unless a once-in-a-term, high-profile event arises.
In Warren Erdman’s six-year term on the board, more than a handful of these “infrequent” actions took place. Erdman, appointed to the board in 2007 by former Gov. Matt Blunt, ends his term early next year, but not without his share of media coverage. From university president searches, to changes in the university’s pension plan, a statewide tobacco tax referendum to conference realignment for Mizzou, the University of Missouri – and its governing Board of Curators – has garnered its share of ink and TV coverage.
Take, for example, Erdman’s first weeks on the board in 2007. Then System President Elson Floyd had resigned in late 2006 to take the president position at Washington State University. And without any settling in time, Erdman and his eight colleagues were tasked with hiring an interim president and implementing a nationwide search for Floyd’s permanent replacement.

Fast forward to late 2011, when Erdman could reasonably expect to be easing out of his Curator’s position, the board again was cast in the spotlight with the national issue of conference realignment for the University of Missouri (Columbia). The Columbia campus – one of the system's

four campuses, including UMKC, UM-St. Louis and Missouri University of Science and Technology (Rolla) –became the center of national attention as it pondered its future conference affiliation. The board, which Erdman said gives great deference to the individual campuses in such matters, in October 2011 granted Chancellor Brady Deaton the power to make a decision that he deemed best for the campus. 
“I received thousands, and thousands and thousands of emails” from people offering advice and strong opinions on Mizzou’s potential move to the SEC, said Erdman. “It was a gargantuan issue.”
On Nov. 7, 2011, Mizzou officially left the Big 12 for the SEC.

A busy 2011
The Board of Curators will typically meet five times per year, often rotating from among the campuses. In 2011, when Erdman served as chair, the board met 25 times, due to conference realignment, reform of its pension program for employees, and another unexpected presidential search.
In 2011, President Gary Forsee unexpectedly announced that he would resign from his position due to his wife’s health issues.
“In the six years that I served on the Board of Curators, I served with five presidents,” he said. “President Floyd, Interim President (Gordon) Lamb, President Forsee, Interim President (Steve) Owens and now President Tim Wolfe.” And suddenly, Erdman had to preside over a nationwide search … again. 
“So, one of the things I was concerned about while I was chairing both the full Board of Curators and the presidential search committee, I wanted to make sure we had a president going forward that would stay here for a while, and I think we have that in Tim Wolfe.”
Erdman admits that his year of chairmanship “was an incredibly stressful year,” as head of the board and as a top executive of Kansas City Southern, a transportation holding company with railroad investments in the US, Mexico and Panama. “Kansas City Southern and the management here have been very understanding, and I am very grateful.”
After the fast-paced year in 2011, things slowed down substantially, much to the delight of other board members and Erdman’s wife, Jenny (left). “My successor (as board chair, David Bradley) ran on a platform promising no more than five meetings and was unanimously elected," joked Erdman, adding, “(Jenny) was ready for my term to end.”
Following his term as chair, Erdman said he decided to “throw myself into what is probably the most disappointing failure that I have experienced while on the Board of Curators.” As a private citizen and not in an official Curator role, Erdman served as statewide finance chair of the group that brought Missouri Proposition B to the ballot in November. Proposition B sought to increase the state’s cigarette tax from 17 cents to 90 cents per pack. Revenues from the tax were to benefit public elementary, secondary and higher education, and public health.
Golden Era at UMKC

As Erdman looks forward to 2013 and beyond, he said he wasn’t certain what civic causes he undertakes next, but he said he would remain tied in with UMKC, which he said was entering its golden years.

At right, Chancellor Leo Morton, Erdman, Jolie Justus (Mo. Sen.; 10th Dist.), and UM General Counsel Steve Owens, then interim president.





Much of UMKC’s recent success can be traced to support from the Board of Curators, and particularly, Erdman, according to UMKC Chancellor Leo Morton.
“In recent years, you could feel the pent-up passion on campus to do great things, almost as if the lid of potential was about to burst open,” said Morton. "Thankfully, Warren Erdman and the entire Board of Curators granted us a long leash to try new things, encouraged us when we needed it and supported the campus when we started to think outside the box.”
In particular, Morton said he appreciates the system’s debt financing program, which allowed UMKC to leverage the University of Missouri’s stellar credit rating and capacity to help finance future revenue generating construction projects and upgrades. For example, the bond debt on new construction projects such as the Student Union, parking garages and residence halls will be repaid through user fees while others will be paid for through enrollment growth. However, without the system’s involvement, UMKC might not have been able to fund such large projects.  

At left, UMKC Student Union, designed and funded by UMKC students, backed by the University of Missouri bond program.



Erdman named off numerous recent UMKC accomplishments and said he expected many more over the coming years, due to campus leadership, its faculty, students, a growing national/international reputation and close ties with the Kansas City community.
Following is a partial list of recent UMKC accolades, in Erdman’s own words:
• “In spite of declining state support, this is a Golden Era for the University of Missouri. There is no doubt this is the Golden Era for UMKC.”
• “UMKC has come of age in the last 10 years or so through its growth, its investment in new plant and equipment, and a commitment to quality. Walk around campus and you will find new facilities, new equipment everywhere.” 
• “The respect for UMKC in Kansas City is at an all-time high. Just last Friday (Dec. 14), the Downtown Council of Kansas City had their annual luncheon, and it was all about UMKC. The greater Kansas City community has embraced UMKC, and to be a great city, we must have a great university. UMKC is Kansas City’s great university.”
• “(UMKC) is a research university with outstanding graduate programs, an outstanding medical school, law school, dental school, pharmacy school, nursing school, an internationally recognized school of business and management, a world recognized Conservatory of Music and Dance, and increasingly an extremely high-value undergraduate program along with so many others.”
• “UMKC is really in its stride right now, and I could not be more proud of the progress UMKC has made.”
• “The Conservatory’s annual Crescendo Gala is the best charitable event we go to each year. The Conservatory is not only a city treasure but a national treasure.”
• “I’m very supportive of Conservatory Dean Peter Witte’s effort to move the Conservatory to new facilities near the Kauffman Performing Arts Center. My number one capital priority would be to get the Conservatory new facilities; we’re about to get it done.”
• “Recently the Chamber of Commerce adopted the Big 5 aspirational statements for Kansas City, and UMKC is at the center of three of these and is an integral part of all five.”
