BELMONT, Mass., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BSB Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:    BLMT) (the "Company"), the holding company for Belmont Savings Bank (the "Bank"), a state-chartered savings bank headquartered in Belmont, Massachusetts, today reported a 35.9% increase in net income to $4.01 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to net income of $2.95 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. This is the Bank's 16th consecutive quarter of earnings growth. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $7.68 million or $0.83 per diluted share as compared to net income of $5.49 million or $0.61 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or an increase in net income of 39.8%.










 







							 		(PRNewsfoto/BSB Bancorp, Inc.)...
							  



 

 
 



Robert M. Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Strong loan demand, good fee income, expense control and credit quality combined to produce very solid quarterly results."
NET INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME
Net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $13.95 million as compared to $11.71 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 or a 19.1% increase. The provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $707,000 as compared to $741,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 or a 4.6% decrease. This resulted in an increase of $2.28 million or 20.7% in net interest and dividend income after provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $27.21 million as compared to $22.99 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or an 18.4% increase. The provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.54 million as compared to $1.34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or a 14.6% increase. This resulted in an increase of $4.02 million or 18.6% in net interest and dividend income after provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.
NONINTEREST INCOME
Noninterest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $995,000 as compared to $705,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 or an increase of 41.1%. 

Customer service fees decreased $25,000 or 11.2% primarily due to declines in NSF and other fees. 
Income from bank owned life insurance increased $57,000 or 24.1% primarily due to a purchase of $5.00 million in additional bank owned life insurance policies at the end of the second quarter of 2016.

A talented and committed colleague team along with continued operational enhancements have contributed to the improvement in our efficiency ratio. 
INCOME TAXES
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.60 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.74 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, reflecting effective tax rates of 39.1% and 37.0%, respectively. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $4.50 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to a provision for income taxes of $3.29 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, reflecting effective tax rates of 37.0% and 37.4%, respectively. 
BALANCE SHEET
At June 30, 2017, total assets were $2.37 billion, an increase of $212.18 million or 9.8% from $2.16 billion at December 31, 2016. The Company experienced net loan growth of $201.55 million or 10.8% from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017. 1-4 family residential real estate loans and commercial real estate loans increased by $162.27 million and $66.98 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in indirect auto loans of $17.29 million, driven by the suspension of new originations due to current market conditions. The asset growth was primarily funded by growth in deposits and federal home loan bank advances.
At June 30, 2017, deposits totaled $1.61 billion, an increase of $141.39 million or 9.6% from $1.47 billion at December 31, 2016. Core deposits, which we consider to include all deposits other than CDs, increased by $62.93 million from $1.13 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.20 billion at June 30, 2017. Hal R. Tovin, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, said "Our competitive retail product offerings, the ongoing commitment to our targeted business segment strategy and our focus on commercial relationship expansion have contributed to our strong deposit growth."
Total stockholders' equity increased by $8.90 million from $160.92 million as of December 31, 2016 to $169.83 million as of June 30, 2017. This increase is primarily the result of earnings of $7.68 million and a $1.08 million increase in additional paid-in capital related to stock-based compensation. 
ASSET QUALITY
Asset quality remains strong. The allowance for loan losses in total and as a percentage of total loans as of June 30, 2017 was $15.09 million and 0.73%, respectively, as compared to $13.59 million and 0.73%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded net charge offs of $32,000, as compared to net charge offs of $37,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total non-performing assets were $1.70 million or 0.07% of total assets as of June 30, 2017 as compared to $1.82 million or 0.08% of total assets as of December 31, 2016.
