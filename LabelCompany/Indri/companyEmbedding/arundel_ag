 About Us
Company history
Board of directors
Other Executive management



About Us
Arundel AG (“Arundel”) is a Swiss corporation whose shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange under the regulatory standard for equity securities (International Reporting Standard). It is the holding company for the Group.

Company History


Arundel was formed in 1988 as a property investment company and obtained a listing for its shares in Zurich in 2005. In 2007, the Group acquired four office buildings in Leipzig, Germany, leased to the Free State of Saxony (Covenant Strength: AAA). In 2013, the Group’s near term focus shifted from Europe to India and it conditionally acquired undeveloped parcels of land in India in 2015 and 2016.
In 2016, Arundel acquired RP&C International Inc. (“RP&C”), an investment banking group based in London. RP&C principals have been involved with Arundel since inception and have provided management and advisory services to Arundel since 1998.


Following the acquisition of RP&C, Arundel’s subsidiaries are regulated in the transaction of their businesses in the US by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority; and in Mauritius by the Mauritian Financial Services Commission. The Group operates from offices in London, New York and Mauritius.


Since its formation in 1992, RP&C has acted as sponsor, lead manager, co-lead manager, placement agent or adviser on nearly $8.5 billion of transactions. RP&C’s activities have encompassed the private placement of equity and debt, merger and acquisition advice, the creation and marketing of structured finance products and the formation and management of various investment entities.
RP&C has been involved in raising in excess of $1.4 billion of equity through reverse mergers, initial public offerings and secondary placings; $3.6 billion for investment funds; $1.3 billion of senior and mezzanine debt and $1.6 billion of convertible securities. Industries which RP&C has helped finance include real estate, energy, IT, telecoms, healthcare, mining, metals, manufacturing and transport.

These include the General Development Plan, South County Small Area Plan, and Land Preservation, Parks, and Recreation Plan. These plans are comprised of policies, recommendations, and strategies related primarily to promoting agriculture and forestry as a viable sector of the local economy; encouraging the use of best management practices, to reduce nutrient runoff, and promote healthy streams; discourage the loss of prime agricultural and forest land to development; and working cooperatively with State agencies and property owners to increase the amount of land protected through easement acquisition.DeadlinesNovember 1 & April 1 – Anne Arundel County Agricultural and Woodland Preservation ProgramMay 1 – Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation FoundationJanuary - December – Rural Legacy (based on annual funding)Agricultural and Woodland Preservation MapAgricultural and Woodland Preservation ProgramsPlanning FrameworkThe County has three primary planning documents that establish goals and strategies relating to agricultural and woodland preservation. These include the General Development Plan, South County Small Area Plan, and 2013 Land Preservation, Parks, and Recreation Plan. These plans are comprised of policies, recommendations, and strategies related primarily to promoting agriculture and forestry as a viable sector of the local economy; encouraging the use of best management practices, to reduce nutrient runoff, and promote healthy streams; discourage the loss of prime agricultural and forest land to development; and working cooperatively with State agencies and property owners to increase the amount of land protected through easement acquisition.Easement Acquisition MechanismsMaryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) The program is a purchase of development rights program. When the State of Maryland purchases your development rights, you voluntarily sell your right in perpetuity to develop your farm for residential, commercial, or industrial use. This means that, for whatever compensation mutually agreed upon by you and the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation, you will preserve the land for agricultural use, subject to the Annotated Code and the Foundation’s Regulations. Anne Arundel County has participated in the MALPF Program since 1980. As of December 1, 2015, Anne Arundel County has a total of 5,118 acres are permanently preserved through MALPF easements. Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF)  Anne Arundel County Agricultural and Woodland Preservation Program The County’s Agricultural and Woodland Preservation Program was created in 1990 to supplement the MALPF program and to offer an alternative for agricultural preservation that recognized the County’s small farms.  This program is a purchase of development rights program where you voluntarily sell your right in perpetuity to develop your farm for residential, commercial, or industrial use subject to Anne Arundel County Code Article 17 Title 10.  Permitted activities include any farm use of the land; operation at any time of machinery used in farm production or the primary processing of any ag products; any normal ag activities and operations, in accordance with good husbandry practices, that do not cause bodily injury or directly endanger human health, including activities that may produce normal ag related noise and odors; and the sale of farm products produced on the farm where the sales are made. As of December 1, 2015, a total of 6,118 acres have been permanently preserved through this program.   In 1999 an Installment Purchase Agreement (IPA) option was added to stimulate interest and add value to the program.  An installment purchase agreement (IPA) is a contract between the County and the property owner selling his/her development rights.  In the IPA, the County promises to pay the purchase price for an easement on specified dates in the future.  The IPA also commits the County to pay interest on the outstanding purchase price between the time that the easement is given to the County (at closing) and the date that the purchase price is paid to the seller. Rural Legacy Program The Rural Legacy Program, developed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), consists of two concepts: first, delineating a specific geographic area of a county in need of focused land conservation efforts, and, second, acquiring easements from willing landowners within that area. Anne Arundel County’s Rural Legacy Area (RLA) consists of approximately 37,381-acres and is contained entirely within the Priority Preservation Area as designated in the 2009 General Development Plan.  The RLA covers an area south of Central Avenue, extending west to east between the Patuxent and the Rhode Rivers.  The key goals of the Anne Arundel Rural Legacy Area are to complete a greenway of gently rolling farmland, preserving views from some of the County’s most scenic and historic roads, and protecting multiple other scenic, historic and natural resources.  As of December 1, 2015, approximately 1,460 acres were preserved through the Rural Legacy program. Approximately 16,179 acres (43 percent) of the RLA has been protected. For additional information, visit DNR Resource Management/Land Conservation.   There is an Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board, appointed by the County Executive, to promote preservation of agriculture within the County by offering assistance to farmers concerning the purchase of County and State agricultural easements. These meetings are open to the public. Information on future meetings can be provided, by calling the Anne Arundel County Department of Recreation and Parks (410) 222-7317.Related InformationApplication to Sell an EasementDeed of EasementMALPF Application to Sell an EasementMALPF Deed of EasementRural Legacy Area Application for Easement SaleRural Legacy Deed of Conservation EasementAbout Our CountyAs the most centrally-located county in Maryland and site of the state capital of Annapolis, Anne Arundel County is in many ways the heart of Maryland.

Value-Added Products and Enterprises
Direct marketing and value-added products are two of the best strategies farmers can employ to improve net profitability. Value-added products can open new markets, enhance the public's appreciation for the farm, and extend the marketing season.
Value-added processing offers farmers the potential to capture a larger share of the food dollar. The farmer's share of the consumer's food shopping dollar has decreased from 46 percent in 1913 to just fewer than 20 percent in 2006, according to the USDA Economic Research Service. Why? Consumers buy more "ready-to-eat" or "ready-to-cook" food while farmers generally produce and market raw agricultural commodities.
Value-added products are defined by USDA as having:
A change in the physical state or form of the product (such as milling wheat into flour or making strawberries into jam).
The production of a product in a manner that enhances its value (such as organically produced products).
The physical segregation of an agricultural commodity or product in a manner that results in the enhancement of the value of that commodity or product (such as an identity preserved marketing system).
Unfortunately, there is no simple blueprint to follow that applies to everyone for value-added. The resources listed on this site can assist you in the process of identifying, selecting, managing, monitoring, and growing a value-added enterprise.Explore the value-added sections on Meats and Poultry, Dairy, Acidified Foods and Cottage Industry.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
