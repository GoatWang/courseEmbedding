About Aviance Capital
Aviance Capital Partners is more than just a partnership. The founding partners, Orville D. Ward and James R. Neel, began as a team in 1999 while working in the Naples, Florida office of a prominent New York based, international Investment Bank and Trust Company. The decision was made to move the Naples business in 2002, and in 2009, the name was changed to Aviance Capital Partners – working out of the same building in North Naples since the move in 2002. In 2011, Jack David Brown merged the Naples-based investment firm he started in 2005 with Aviance.

Strategies


 
All Investors are Unique. So are Solutions.


 
Service and Results are Top Priority
Client goals and our strategies are combined to build lasting and successful relationships
Each client is assigned a Wealth Relations manager to ensure robust service and reviews
Boutique environment with team approach to asset management


 

 


Disciplined Value
High-quality, deeply discounted businesses across all capitalizations
Read More
Our approach to value investing focuses on owning shares of high-quality, deeply discounted businesses. When a business is on solid footing, it often receives a high credit rating. Similarly, we define quality by understanding a company’s credit worthiness and the soundness of its business model. As a result, sound businesses that have little need to raise capital also have greater flexibility to execute their operating and growth strategies. Further, we believe companies that are governed by boards and executives who are in the habit of sharing their earnings through dividend payments have strong incentives for long-term business success. As such, the Disciplined Value strategy favors companies that possess these hallmarks of quality and are trading at prices that reflect a significant discount to fair value.



 
Enhanced Income
High level of income through the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunities
Read More
There are more than twenty different asset classes which may generate investment income. The attraction of each different income producing asset class depends upon many factors including interest rates, inflation and position in various economic cycles. Many of these asset classes are not as sensitive to interest rates as bonds; however, they may be more sensitive to economic cycles. All investments possess different risk factors which must be carefully considered prior to purchase. We review these methods of income generation and actively allocate capital to those asset classes offering a higher level of income with a lower probability of capital depreciation when compared to traditional fixed income investments and with regard to current economic cycles.


 
Concentrated Stock
Options strategies tailored to produce income and/or hedge the downside
Read More
Several investors attribute a significant portion of their wealth to ownership in one or two companies. As these positions grow larger so do the risks related to diversification, volatility, and tax burdens. Our approach to reducing these risks involves understanding the unique circumstances of the client and choosing the best strategy. A common strategy for managing concentrated positions employs the use of “covered call” or “collared” option strategies. However, the chosen strategy and its implementation depend on the client’s long term intentions for the position, tax circumstances, and market environment.


 
Global Plus
Value-tilted exposure to both international and domestic markets
Read More
For investors seeking broad exposure to global stock markets, the Global Plus strategy offers a value-oriented solution. The strategy invests in a variety of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and closed-end funds (CEFs). Aviance’s search for global value among ETFs focuses on broad market securities and attractive fundamental characteristics – like low price-to-earnings ratios among other factors. Further, the strategy invests in CEFs that are generally trading at significant discounts to net asset value. We believe this approach positions investors to take advantage of discounted investments in the global space.


 

Disciplined Growth
Large-cap growth companies with strong fundamentals at ideal entry points
Read More
Growth characteristics are one of acceleration, change and improving fundamentals. Our proprietary analysis looks for intrinsic markers that portend growth while simultaneously looking for favorable entry points – referred to as “Growth at a Reasonable Price” (GARP). Aviance Capital Partners conducts screens looking for acceleration in areas that include earnings growth, sales growth, margin expansion and discretionary cash flow. As we evaluate our screen results, we focus on predominately large-cap companies with a net present value above the current market price based on cash flow calculations and attempt to set valuation strike points.


 
Disciplined Growth Hedged
Access to our growth strategy coupled with options to reduce the downside
Read More
The Disciplined Growth Hedged strategy offers a way for investors to access our growth strategy but further seeks to reduce market volatility and downside risk by employing market hedging techniques. We seek to strike an optimal balance between the cost of the hedge and its likely protection against adverse market conditions.


 
Traditional Fixed Income
Municipal or corporate portfolio tailored to each clients’ specific needs
Read More
For investors seeking to preserve capital and generate income, we offer traditional bond portfolios consisting of only investment-grade credit quality bonds such as municipal, corporate, and/or government issued.  Each portfolio is custom built to serve the needs of the investor. We seek to add value by taking advantage of the shape of the yield curve, attractive spread opportunities, and issue-specific opportunities.


 
Core Plus Fixed Income
Exposure to all fixed income classes through bottom-up security selection
Read More
Our Core Plus Fixed Income strategy is suited for investors seeking broad exposure to bond markets with the potential for attractive rates of distributed income. The strategy invests in a variety of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and closed-end funds (CEFs). The Core element of the strategy invests in ETFs that seek to match the performance of the broad fixed-income markets. The Plus element of the strategy seeks to outperform the fixed-income market by investing in fixed-income oriented CEFs that are generally trading at a significant discount to net asset value.

About Us



 
As a private wealth manager, our talents and resources are focused on a select number of clients enabling us to achieve competitive returns and deliver superior client service. Every client relationship is viewed as a partnership formed to advance the long-term success of each investment portfolio. Our role in this partnership is providing intelligent, objective, investment expertise based on the experience and diversity of our assembled team of professionals. We have developed our program to also work closely with our clients’ outside advisers in both tax and estate planning.Aviance Capital Partners is more than just a partnership. The founding partners, Orville D. Ward and James R. Neel, began as a team in 1999 while working in the Naples, Florida office of a prominent New York based, international Investment Bank and Trust Company. The decision was made to move the Naples business in 2002, and in 2009, the name was changed to Aviance Capital Partners – working out of the same building in North Naples since the move in 2002.
In 2011, Jack David Brown merged the Naples-based investment firm he started in 2005 with Aviance. Owned exclusively by its managing members, Aviance Capital Partners is supported by staff in operations, client services, trading and new accounts.




Investment Philosophy
“Conservative yet Opportunistic” describes our philosophy toward building custom equity, fixed income, and balanced portfolios. Our most important role as a private investment adviser is to protect (“conserve”) the financial resources of our trusted clients while achieving market beating returns. We view every investment as having an element of risk, but one which provides a unique “opportunity.”
 

 
Wealth Relations
Each client relationship begins with a thorough review of the objectives, constraints and income demands that may impact the design and balance of the portfolio. We encourage a comprehensive discussion of the client’s investment experience, expectations, risk tolerance and any special requirements or restrictions. The result is distinct priorities and realistic investment objectives with achievable goals.

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

About Aviance Capital
Aviance Capital Partners is more than just a partnership. The founding partners, Orville D. Ward and James R. Neel, began as a team in 1999 while working in the Naples, Florida office of a prominent New York based, international Investment Bank and Trust Company. The decision was made to move the Naples business in 2002, and in 2009, the name was changed to Aviance Capital Partners – working out of the same building in North Naples since the move in 2002. In 2011, Jack David Brown merged the Naples-based investment firm he started in 2005 with Aviance.
