Legal disclaimer: Results may vary from pet to pet







	My 11 year old Lab had been on Cushing meds for 1 ½ months and was getting worse – at first she seemed to be doing ok, but then started to really deteriorate. I did some research and realized the cure might be as bad as the disease. Then I looked for alternatives for Cushings and found this website and read how other animals did with this Adrenal Harmony. About two months ago I decided to give it a try as I was losing hope anyway. Am I ever glad I did and I am happy to say she is doing way better and has returned to her happy self. Her tummy looks better, she is eating better, she is urinating less, her energy and attitude are way better. I would encourage anyone to give it a try!

Cushing's Disease
Cushing's disease results from an excess of adrenal gland hormones. It is a common side-effect of drugs such as corticosteroids, which are often prescribed to treat canine arthritis, allergies and other ailments. Cushing's disease can also result from a benign tumor on one of the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland.
Symptoms of Cushing's disease include:

Increased thirst and appetite
Frequent urination
Loss of hair
Skin problems
Panting
High blood pressure
Increased susceptibility to infections

If left untreated, Cushing's disease can lead to other conditions like diabetes and heart problems.
Conventional Therapies
Note: Your dog's Cushing’s could be caused by a corticosteroid drug - it may be possible to wean your dog off the drug; however, this must be performed under professional supervision to avoid complications. You can speak to your vet about this. Corticosteroids sometimes have side effects that are worse than the condition they were used to treat, and make your dog more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. Every day, we get calls from customers looking for an alternative to steroid drugs.
Antineoplastic drugs - During its evaluation as an insecticide, a leading antineoplastic drug was discovered to have adrenocorticolytic effects. The most obvious and rapid response is a reduction in water intake, urine output, and appetite, which usually occur at the end of the initial course of therapy. Muscle strength and exercise tolerance improve over the first 3-4 weeks. Skin and hair coat changes take longer and the progress is variable. After the first re-evaluation, rechecks should be scheduled every 3-6 months for the rest of the pet’s life to determine whether the dose needs to be adjusted depending on the results of ACTH response testing. Overall, based on the results of three survival studies, the mean survival time of canines with pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, that were treated with this drug, is 24 to 30 months with a total range of 1 day to 13 years.
Surgery - If your dog's Cushing's disease was caused by a tumor, surgery might be an option. Only your vet is qualified to consult with about this option.
3-beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase drugs - These drugs have been shown to be an effective treatment for canine and feline Cushing’s syndrome. These are a synthetic, orally active steroid analogue. They act as a competitive inhibitor of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenate enzyme system and thereby inhibit the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone as well as other steroids. The blockade is reversible and appears to be dose-related.
A word from our veterinarian:
It is important to note that long-term use of corticosteroid drugs (usually prescribed for inflammatory discomfort such as skin allergy or arthritis) can result in a rebound effect and excess production of cortisol by the adrenal glands can ensue. Excessive production of cortisol can also be caused by a tumor, either of the pituitary or the adrenal glands.
What is Adrenal Harmony Gold?
Adrenal Harmony Gold was developed by our holistic veterinarians to support your dog with Cushing's. The therapeutic actions of the ingredients are:  adaptogenic, antioxidant and will support the nervous system. These herbs are particularly suited to targeting the adrenal glands and its functions, but also exert an effect on the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. "Adaptogens" are a classification of herbs considered to support the adrenals, helping the body adapt naturally to stressors and produce normal, healthy levels of cortisol. Unlike drugs, adaptogens will not stimulate or depress adrenal function but, rather, help the adrenals normalize their hormone production. Antioxidants counter oxidative (free radical) damage that can lead to degeneration.
Together, the ingredients in Adrenal Harmony Gold target key cellular mechanisms to help maintain normal balance. 
What is Adrenal Harmony Gold used for?
Adrenal glands play a vital role in the health of your pet. The adrenal glands are two small glands situated on top of each kidney and they are involved in a multitude of physiological processes. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are responsible for sending messages to the adrenals so they can secrete the right amount of hormones and maintain equilibrium within the body.
Some of the main adrenal gland functions are to:

Help the body respond to stress and inflammation through their production of corticosteroid hormones.
Play an important role in regulating water and electrolyte balance (affects urine output and thirst).
Produce hormones that affect blood sugar (affects appetite).

Adrenal Harmony Gold targets the HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal) axis to strengthen the body's internal feedback mechanisms. This in turn, can affect areas of the body influenced by the adrenal glands. Expect improved quality of life within the first two weeks of starting this formula. If you have not seen an improvement within two weeks, the dose may be safely increased. The "Directions" tab has more details.
Can my dog take Adrenal Harmony Gold with medications?
Do not give Adrenal Harmony Gold if your pet is taking blood-thinners. A veterinarian who has performed a complete medical check of your dog can help to establish safety of medications taken with other products or specific diets.
Does it come with a guarantee?
Yes!  Adrenal Harmony Gold comes with a 90-day, money-back guarantee.

Who makes Adrenal Harmony Gold?
Adrenal Harmony Gold is made by PetWellbeing.com, founded in 2001.  Our goal? To bring the wisdom and experience of our caring holistic veterinarians to your pet.  When your pet is healthy; you're happy.
To fulfill our vision, our on-staff, holistic veterinarians have developed formulas using time-honored, traditional uses of herbs, and integrated the latest scientific research.  It is our aim to produce the best products for your pet that we can.




Fresh Ashwagandha root (Withania somniferum):  A primary adaptogen in this formula, Ashwagandha assists the adrenal glands directly to respond normally and produce healthy amounts of cortisol. This is a well-known herb for helping the body's stress levels and supporting normal, restful sleep.

Holy Basil leaf (Ocimum sanctum):  Also called Tulsi, Holy Basil is a gentle adaptogen for supporting the adrenal glands. Of key importance, adaptogens will neither cause the body to relax nor become stimulated, necessarily. Rather, their action is to assist the body to adapt as needed and bring it back into balance. For that reason, adaptogens are used for a variety of reasons when normal adrenal function is desired.

Fresh Turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa):  One of the best antioxidant herbs available, Turmeric also supports liver health. Turmeric can be difficult for the body to absorb. Our extraction method using fresh, organic Turmeric is an extremely potent liquid extract, much stronger than a simple glycerin extraction and captures all of the useful constituents of this herb, including curcumin and other curcuminoids.

Bacopa herb (Bacopa monnieri):  Bacopa exhibits uses both as an adaptogen and as an antioxidant. It has also been used for stress and is said to generally contribute to healthy moods and cognitive function.

Sarsaparilla root (Smilax officinalis):  A traditional herb of the south western United States, Sarsaparilla has a long-standing use for helping the body to normally excrete excess toxic materials through the lymphatic system. It has also been used to support liver function and healthy blood pressure levels.

Astragalus root (Astragalus membranaceous):  Another popular "adaptogen", Astragalus helps the body's normal ability to adapt to stress. It also contains polysaccharides, constituents that assist the body's normal immune response to fight off bacteria and viruses.

Milk Thistle seed (Silybum marianum):  A gentle and effective herb for normal liver function, Milk Thistle supports the liver's metabolization of drugs and toxins for excretion. Another function of the liver is to denature (take apart) circulating hormones, thereby helping to keep the balance of hormones in the body.

Blessed Thistle flower (Cnicus benedictus):  Blessed or Holy Thistle has similar uses as Milk Thislte for liver support. Additionally, it has been shown to exhibit support for the immune system and digestion.

Chaste Tree berry (Vitex agnus-castus):  Used for its gentle, tonic action on the anterior pituitary, Vitex is an amphoteric herb, meaning it will help maintain normal hormonal levels, rather than cause them to go higher or lower. Vitex is included in this formula for its affect on the pituitary's action in adrenal hormone regulation.

Prickly Ash bark (Zanthoxylum americanum):  Used by many First Nations communities at one time, the bark of the Prickly Ash tree has been termed an "alterative", meaning that it will help support normal flow of lymphatic circulation. It also helps maintain normal arterial and capillary circulation.

Why This Gold Miner's Shares Fell 17.5% in June
Harmony Gold Mining Co. is facing a bit of a cliff, and that's weighing on the stock.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jul 7, 2017 at 9:35AM
            
            





What happened
Harmony Gold Mining Co. (NYSE:HMY) watched its shares drop a painful 17.5% last month. So far this year, the stock is down more than 25% after posting a 2016 advance of more than 100%. That said, it was up as much as 300% at one point last year.
Harmony's 2016 stock performance, however, roughly followed the ups and downs in the price of gold. The share price had been tracking gold this year, too, until around April. That was when the stock began to do notably worse than the precious metal.
So what
Harmony's first big problem is its cost structure: It's all-in sustaining cost target for its fiscal 2017 (which ended June 30) is $1,100 an ounce. Compare that to Goldcorp (NYSE:GG), for example, which is expecting all in sustaining costs of around $900 an ounce in 2017 -- and other gold miners have even lower all-in sustaining costs. Goldcorp's shares, for reference, were only down 5% last month, tracking roughly along with gold. But that performance difference makes some sense since Harmony needs higher gold prices to make money because it has higher costs. Thus a drop in the price of gold will have a larger impact on Harmony's results than it will on Goldcorp's.

But there's another factor at play at Harmony: It has hedges in place to protect itself from falling gold prices and currency shifts in the South African rand. That's good news, overall, except that those rand gold hedges started to roll off in April. In other words, falling gold prices will have an even larger impact on Harmony through the rest of the year. The company's hedges will continue fall away through December, which prompted analyst concerns as far back as November 2016.  

Harmony's hedges are rolling off. Image source: Harmony Gold Mining Co.  

So, putting it all together, investors appear to be pricing in worse results for Harmony through the rest of the year now that those protective hedges are starting to fall away. With that as a backdrop, Harmony's less than inspiring stock price performance last month makes a lot of sense.





Now what
Harmony Gold is a relatively small gold miner with relatively high costs. Based on its cost structure and size, its stock is most appropriate for aggressive investors who expect a notable gold rally. But it's important to remember that as its hedges roll off, the downside risk to the company's financial results will increase.

JSE: HAR) today announced that Ted Grobicki stepped down from its Board as
executive director, effective 30 March 2006. Ted will remain in Harmony's
employment until the end of April 2006.

"Ted Grobicki, who has been on the Board of Harmony for eleven and a half
years, served as a mentor for the entire Harmony team. For the past six years

will be missed", said Bernard Swanepoel. At the same time the company is
pleased to announce that Ms Fikile Mothobi has joined the Board as

"We are privileged and honored to attract a candidate of Fikile's calibre to
serve on the Harmony Board. Fikile will not only bring specific skills to the

of Harmony's equity and gender profiles" said Bernard Swanepoel.

How Analysts Rated Harmony Gold Mining Co




				 08 Juillet, 2017,  11:07 | Author: Marc Bacque			












Analysts have placed a $2.56 price target on Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited, suggesting a 59.01% gain from recent close. The company has market cap of $708.47 million. Schroder Investment Management Group now owns 4,439,224 shares of the mining company's stock worth $10,388,000 after buying an additional 105,124 shares in the last quarter. Future earnings predictions are perhaps the most essential input when trying to value a company.
While looking at the Stock's Performance, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited now shows a Weekly Performance of -1.8%, where Monthly Performance is -14.14%, Quarterly performance is -37.64%, 6 Months performance is -30.21% and yearly performance percentage is -60%.A number of other brokerages also recently commented on HMY. The stock has a beta value of -1.93. Over the last five days, shares have faced -4.73% losses and now is down -35.49% since hitting its 200-day moving average of $2.3.Price targets show what analysts believes a stock will be worth at the end of a certain time period. The stock presently has an average rating of "Hold" and a consensus target price of $2.50. The share last price represents downtick move of -40.52% in value from company's 52-Week high price and shows 0.39% above change in value from its 52-Week low price.

Our business 


Harmony operates in South Africa and in Papua New Guinea. The company has nine underground mines, one open-pit mine and several surface operations in South Africa. In Papua New Guinea, it has Hidden Valley, an open-pit gold and silver mine and a 50% interest in the Morobe Mining Joint Venture, which includes the Golpu project and extensive exploration tenements. Outside the joint venture, Harmony’s own exploration portfolio focuses principally on highly prospective areas in Papua New Guinea.
In FY16, our South African operations accounted for 93% of total production of 1.08Moz, with 7% coming from Papua New Guinea. At 30 June 2016, Harmony reported attributable gold equivalent mineral reserves of 36.9Moz of gold, and attributable gold mineral resources of 105.2Moz. At the end of FY16, Harmony employed 30 547 people in total – 25 861 employees and 4 580 contractors in South Africa and 76 employees and 30 contractors in Papua New Guinea (excluding employees of the Morobe Mining Joint Ventures). Our employees are drawn from communities around our operations, from other provinces in South Africa and Papua New Guinea and from other countries (Lesotho, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Australia).

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    2.83      Net Money Flow ($)  815,128    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Operations[edit]
Australia[edit]
Big Bell Gold Mine[edit]
The Big Bell Gold Mine was acquired by Harmony through the take over of New Hampton Goldfields Limited in April 2001 for A$54 million.[4][5] Harmony closed the mine in June 2003, having found previous assessments of the grade at Big Bell over optimistic and making mining the deposits thereby unprofitable.[6][7] In January 2010, the mine was sold to Aragon Resources Limited, who chose to rename the project to Murchison Bell.[4][8]
Gidgee Gold Mine[edit]
Acquired through the take over of Abelle Limited in April 2003,[9] Harmony sold on the Gidgee Gold Mine in November 2003 to Legend Mining for A$6.5 million.[10]
Hill 50 Gold Mine[edit]
The Hill 50 Gold Mine at Mount Magnet, in care and maintenance since December 2007, was acquired by Harmony in 2002 when the company took over Hill 50 Gold.[11] Harmony sold the operation to Monarch Gold Mining in late 2007, but Monarch was unable to complete the transaction and went into administration in July 2008.[12] After being unable to re-sell the mine, Harmony conducted a study in regards to carrying out mining at Hill 50 once more. It is currently considering the option of consolidating historic resources into one large super pit, rather than to carry out costly underground mining. Harmony expects the study to be completed in the third quarter of 2010.[13]
South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine[edit]
The South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine became part of Harmony with the take over of Hill 50 Gold. Harmony sold the mine to Dioro Exploration NL and the later settled the purchase of the mine on 30 November 2007. Harmony received A$45 million for the operations, of which $25 million were in cash while the remainder was paid in Dioro shares.[14]
Papua New Guinea[edit]
Hidden Valley[edit]
Hidden Valley is an open-pit, gold-silver mine and processing plant in Morobe Province.[15] The mine is approximately 210 km north-north-west of Port Moresby, and 90 km south-southwest of Lae.[15] It is operated by Morobe Mining Joint Ventures, a 50:50 joint venture between Harmony and Newcrest Mining.[15]
Illegal miner deaths[edit]
Main article: 2009 South African mine deaths
In late May to early June 2009 63 illegal miners died in a Free State, South Africa mine owned by Harmony Gold.[2]
Popular culture[edit]
In South Africa, Harmony Gold secured a license to sell a replica of the One Ring, made from 18 carat South African gold, mined from the area where The Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien was born. Their version of the ring, also inscribed with elvish script, sold in a variety of sizes in various jewellery stores throughout South Africa and directly through their website to anyone in the world who wanted one and could afford the $250 asking price.

Harmony Gold is the third largest gold mining company in South Africa, the 12th largest in the world (2009) and the 5th largest gold producer in the world.[1][2][3] Harmony and its subsidiaries conduct underground and surface gold mining and related activities, including exploration, processing, smelting and refining. During the fiscal year ended 8 October 2004 (fiscal 2004), the company processed approximately 33.955 million tons of ore and sold 3,225,187 ounces (100,376.7 kg) of gold. It also has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Canada. The company owns a number of mines including Elandskraal mine and Phakisa Mine. In South Africa, Harmony Gold holds at least nine mines, an open-pit mine, and many surface operations.[1]

Operations[edit]
Australia[edit]
Big Bell Gold Mine[edit]
The Big Bell Gold Mine was acquired by Harmony through the take over of New Hampton Goldfields Limited in April 2001 for A$54 million.[4][5] Harmony closed the mine in June 2003, having found previous assessments of the grade at Big Bell over optimistic and making mining the deposits thereby unprofitable.[6][7] In January 2010, the mine was sold to Aragon Resources Limited, who chose to rename the project to Murchison Bell.[4][8]
Gidgee Gold Mine[edit]
Acquired through the take over of Abelle Limited in April 2003,[9] Harmony sold on the Gidgee Gold Mine in November 2003 to Legend Mining for A$6.5 million.[10]
Hill 50 Gold Mine[edit]
The Hill 50 Gold Mine at Mount Magnet, in care and maintenance since December 2007, was acquired by Harmony in 2002 when the company took over Hill 50 Gold.[11] Harmony sold the operation to Monarch Gold Mining in late 2007, but Monarch was unable to complete the transaction and went into administration in July 2008.[12] After being unable to re-sell the mine, Harmony conducted a study in regards to carrying out mining at Hill 50 once more. It is currently considering the option of consolidating historic resources into one large super pit, rather than to carry out costly underground mining. Harmony expects the study to be completed in the third quarter of 2010.[13]
South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine[edit]
The South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine became part of Harmony with the take over of Hill 50 Gold. Harmony sold the mine to Dioro Exploration NL and the later settled the purchase of the mine on 30 November 2007. Harmony received A$45 million for the operations, of which $25 million were in cash while the remainder was paid in Dioro shares.[14]
Papua New Guinea[edit]
Hidden Valley[edit]
Hidden Valley is an open-pit, gold-silver mine and processing plant in Morobe Province.[15] The mine is approximately 210 km north-north-west of Port Moresby, and 90 km south-southwest of Lae.[15] It is operated by Morobe Mining Joint Ventures, a 50:50 joint venture between Harmony and Newcrest Mining.[15]
Illegal miner deaths[edit]
Main article: 2009 South African mine deaths
In late May to early June 2009 63 illegal miners died in a Free State, South Africa mine owned by Harmony Gold.[2]
Popular culture[edit]
In South Africa, Harmony Gold secured a license to sell a replica of the One Ring, made from 18 carat South African gold, mined from the area where The Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien was born. Their version of the ring, also inscribed with elvish script, sold in a variety of sizes in various jewellery stores throughout South Africa and directly through their website to anyone in the world who wanted one and could afford the $250 asking price.

Legal disclaimer: Results may vary from pet to pet







	My 11 year old Lab had been on Cushing meds for 1 ½ months and was getting worse – at first she seemed to be doing ok, but then started to really deteriorate. I did some research and realized the cure might be as bad as the disease. Then I looked for alternatives for Cushings and found this website and read how other animals did with this Adrenal Harmony. About two months ago I decided to give it a try as I was losing hope anyway. Am I ever glad I did and I am happy to say she is doing way better and has returned to her happy self. Her tummy looks better, she is eating better, she is urinating less, her energy and attitude are way better. I would encourage anyone to give it a try!

Cushing's Disease
Cushing's disease results from an excess of adrenal gland hormones. It is a common side-effect of drugs such as corticosteroids, which are often prescribed to treat canine arthritis, allergies and other ailments. Cushing's disease can also result from a benign tumor on one of the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland.
Symptoms of Cushing's disease include:

Increased thirst and appetite
Frequent urination
Loss of hair
Skin problems
Panting
High blood pressure
Increased susceptibility to infections

If left untreated, Cushing's disease can lead to other conditions like diabetes and heart problems.
Conventional Therapies
Note: Your dog's Cushing’s could be caused by a corticosteroid drug - it may be possible to wean your dog off the drug; however, this must be performed under professional supervision to avoid complications. You can speak to your vet about this. Corticosteroids sometimes have side effects that are worse than the condition they were used to treat, and make your dog more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. Every day, we get calls from customers looking for an alternative to steroid drugs.
Antineoplastic drugs - During its evaluation as an insecticide, a leading antineoplastic drug was discovered to have adrenocorticolytic effects. The most obvious and rapid response is a reduction in water intake, urine output, and appetite, which usually occur at the end of the initial course of therapy. Muscle strength and exercise tolerance improve over the first 3-4 weeks. Skin and hair coat changes take longer and the progress is variable. After the first re-evaluation, rechecks should be scheduled every 3-6 months for the rest of the pet’s life to determine whether the dose needs to be adjusted depending on the results of ACTH response testing. Overall, based on the results of three survival studies, the mean survival time of canines with pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease, that were treated with this drug, is 24 to 30 months with a total range of 1 day to 13 years.
Surgery - If your dog's Cushing's disease was caused by a tumor, surgery might be an option. Only your vet is qualified to consult with about this option.
3-beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase drugs - These drugs have been shown to be an effective treatment for canine and feline Cushing’s syndrome. These are a synthetic, orally active steroid analogue. They act as a competitive inhibitor of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenate enzyme system and thereby inhibit the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone as well as other steroids. The blockade is reversible and appears to be dose-related.
A word from our veterinarian:
It is important to note that long-term use of corticosteroid drugs (usually prescribed for inflammatory discomfort such as skin allergy or arthritis) can result in a rebound effect and excess production of cortisol by the adrenal glands can ensue. Excessive production of cortisol can also be caused by a tumor, either of the pituitary or the adrenal glands.
What is Adrenal Harmony Gold?
Adrenal Harmony Gold was developed by our holistic veterinarians to support your dog with Cushing's. The therapeutic actions of the ingredients are:  adaptogenic, antioxidant and will support the nervous system. These herbs are particularly suited to targeting the adrenal glands and its functions, but also exert an effect on the pituitary and hypothalamus glands. "Adaptogens" are a classification of herbs considered to support the adrenals, helping the body adapt naturally to stressors and produce normal, healthy levels of cortisol. Unlike drugs, adaptogens will not stimulate or depress adrenal function but, rather, help the adrenals normalize their hormone production. Antioxidants counter oxidative (free radical) damage that can lead to degeneration.
Together, the ingredients in Adrenal Harmony Gold target key cellular mechanisms to help maintain normal balance. 
What is Adrenal Harmony Gold used for?
Adrenal glands play a vital role in the health of your pet. The adrenal glands are two small glands situated on top of each kidney and they are involved in a multitude of physiological processes. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are responsible for sending messages to the adrenals so they can secrete the right amount of hormones and maintain equilibrium within the body.
Some of the main adrenal gland functions are to:

Help the body respond to stress and inflammation through their production of corticosteroid hormones.
Play an important role in regulating water and electrolyte balance (affects urine output and thirst).
Produce hormones that affect blood sugar (affects appetite).

Adrenal Harmony Gold targets the HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal) axis to strengthen the body's internal feedback mechanisms. This in turn, can affect areas of the body influenced by the adrenal glands. Expect improved quality of life within the first two weeks of starting this formula. If you have not seen an improvement within two weeks, the dose may be safely increased. The "Directions" tab has more details.
Can my dog take Adrenal Harmony Gold with medications?
Do not give Adrenal Harmony Gold if your pet is taking blood-thinners. A veterinarian who has performed a complete medical check of your dog can help to establish safety of medications taken with other products or specific diets.
Does it come with a guarantee?
Yes!  Adrenal Harmony Gold comes with a 90-day, money-back guarantee.

Who makes Adrenal Harmony Gold?
Adrenal Harmony Gold is made by PetWellbeing.com, founded in 2001.  Our goal? To bring the wisdom and experience of our caring holistic veterinarians to your pet.  When your pet is healthy; you're happy.
To fulfill our vision, our on-staff, holistic veterinarians have developed formulas using time-honored, traditional uses of herbs, and integrated the latest scientific research.  It is our aim to produce the best products for your pet that we can.




Fresh Ashwagandha root (Withania somniferum):  A primary adaptogen in this formula, Ashwagandha assists the adrenal glands directly to respond normally and produce healthy amounts of cortisol. This is a well-known herb for helping the body's stress levels and supporting normal, restful sleep.

Holy Basil leaf (Ocimum sanctum):  Also called Tulsi, Holy Basil is a gentle adaptogen for supporting the adrenal glands. Of key importance, adaptogens will neither cause the body to relax nor become stimulated, necessarily. Rather, their action is to assist the body to adapt as needed and bring it back into balance. For that reason, adaptogens are used for a variety of reasons when normal adrenal function is desired.

Fresh Turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa):  One of the best antioxidant herbs available, Turmeric also supports liver health. Turmeric can be difficult for the body to absorb. Our extraction method using fresh, organic Turmeric is an extremely potent liquid extract, much stronger than a simple glycerin extraction and captures all of the useful constituents of this herb, including curcumin and other curcuminoids.

Bacopa herb (Bacopa monnieri):  Bacopa exhibits uses both as an adaptogen and as an antioxidant. It has also been used for stress and is said to generally contribute to healthy moods and cognitive function.

Sarsaparilla root (Smilax officinalis):  A traditional herb of the south western United States, Sarsaparilla has a long-standing use for helping the body to normally excrete excess toxic materials through the lymphatic system. It has also been used to support liver function and healthy blood pressure levels.

Astragalus root (Astragalus membranaceous):  Another popular "adaptogen", Astragalus helps the body's normal ability to adapt to stress. It also contains polysaccharides, constituents that assist the body's normal immune response to fight off bacteria and viruses.

Milk Thistle seed (Silybum marianum):  A gentle and effective herb for normal liver function, Milk Thistle supports the liver's metabolization of drugs and toxins for excretion. Another function of the liver is to denature (take apart) circulating hormones, thereby helping to keep the balance of hormones in the body.

Blessed Thistle flower (Cnicus benedictus):  Blessed or Holy Thistle has similar uses as Milk Thislte for liver support. Additionally, it has been shown to exhibit support for the immune system and digestion.

Chaste Tree berry (Vitex agnus-castus):  Used for its gentle, tonic action on the anterior pituitary, Vitex is an amphoteric herb, meaning it will help maintain normal hormonal levels, rather than cause them to go higher or lower. Vitex is included in this formula for its affect on the pituitary's action in adrenal hormone regulation.

Prickly Ash bark (Zanthoxylum americanum):  Used by many First Nations communities at one time, the bark of the Prickly Ash tree has been termed an "alterative", meaning that it will help support normal flow of lymphatic circulation. It also helps maintain normal arterial and capillary circulation.

Some common testimonials I hear about are: More energy, good joint mobility, improvement…

Harmony Gold is the third largest gold mining company in South Africa, the 12th largest in the world (2009) and the 5th largest gold producer in the world.[1][2][3] Harmony and its subsidiaries conduct underground and surface gold mining and related activities, including exploration, processing, smelting and refining. During the fiscal year ended 8 October 2004 (fiscal 2004), the company processed approximately 33.955 million tons of ore and sold 3,225,187 ounces (100,376.7 kg) of gold. It also has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Canada. The company owns a number of mines including Elandskraal mine and Phakisa Mine. In South Africa, Harmony Gold holds at least nine mines, an open-pit mine, and many surface operations.[1]

Operations[edit]
Australia[edit]
Big Bell Gold Mine[edit]
The Big Bell Gold Mine was acquired by Harmony through the take over of New Hampton Goldfields Limited in April 2001 for A$54 million.[4][5] Harmony closed the mine in June 2003, having found previous assessments of the grade at Big Bell over optimistic and making mining the deposits thereby unprofitable.[6][7] In January 2010, the mine was sold to Aragon Resources Limited, who chose to rename the project to Murchison Bell.[4][8]
Gidgee Gold Mine[edit]
Acquired through the take over of Abelle Limited in April 2003,[9] Harmony sold on the Gidgee Gold Mine in November 2003 to Legend Mining for A$6.5 million.[10]
Hill 50 Gold Mine[edit]
The Hill 50 Gold Mine at Mount Magnet, in care and maintenance since December 2007, was acquired by Harmony in 2002 when the company took over Hill 50 Gold.[11] Harmony sold the operation to Monarch Gold Mining in late 2007, but Monarch was unable to complete the transaction and went into administration in July 2008.[12] After being unable to re-sell the mine, Harmony conducted a study in regards to carrying out mining at Hill 50 once more. It is currently considering the option of consolidating historic resources into one large super pit, rather than to carry out costly underground mining. Harmony expects the study to be completed in the third quarter of 2010.[13]
South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine[edit]
The South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine became part of Harmony with the take over of Hill 50 Gold. Harmony sold the mine to Dioro Exploration NL and the later settled the purchase of the mine on 30 November 2007. Harmony received A$45 million for the operations, of which $25 million were in cash while the remainder was paid in Dioro shares.[14]
Papua New Guinea[edit]
Hidden Valley[edit]
Hidden Valley is an open-pit, gold-silver mine and processing plant in Morobe Province.[15] The mine is approximately 210 km north-north-west of Port Moresby, and 90 km south-southwest of Lae.[15] It is operated by Morobe Mining Joint Ventures, a 50:50 joint venture between Harmony and Newcrest Mining.[15]
Illegal miner deaths[edit]
Main article: 2009 South African mine deaths
In late May to early June 2009 63 illegal miners died in a Free State, South Africa mine owned by Harmony Gold.[2]
Popular culture[edit]
In South Africa, Harmony Gold secured a license to sell a replica of the One Ring, made from 18 carat South African gold, mined from the area where The Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien was born. Their version of the ring, also inscribed with elvish script, sold in a variety of sizes in various jewellery stores throughout South Africa and directly through their website to anyone in the world who wanted one and could afford the $250 asking price.

Harmony Gold is the third largest gold mining company in South Africa, the 12th largest in the world (2009) and the 5th largest gold producer in the world.[1][2][3] Harmony and its subsidiaries conduct underground and surface gold mining and related activities, including exploration, processing, smelting and refining. During the fiscal year ended 8 October 2004 (fiscal 2004), the company processed approximately 33.955 million tons of ore and sold 3,225,187 ounces (100,376.7 kg) of gold. It also has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Canada. The company owns a number of mines including Elandskraal mine and Phakisa Mine. In South Africa, Harmony Gold holds at least nine mines, an open-pit mine, and many surface operations.[1]

Operations[edit]
Australia[edit]
Big Bell Gold Mine[edit]
The Big Bell Gold Mine was acquired by Harmony through the take over of New Hampton Goldfields Limited in April 2001 for A$54 million.[4][5] Harmony closed the mine in June 2003, having found previous assessments of the grade at Big Bell over optimistic and making mining the deposits thereby unprofitable.[6][7] In January 2010, the mine was sold to Aragon Resources Limited, who chose to rename the project to Murchison Bell.[4][8]
Gidgee Gold Mine[edit]
Acquired through the take over of Abelle Limited in April 2003,[9] Harmony sold on the Gidgee Gold Mine in November 2003 to Legend Mining for A$6.5 million.[10]
Hill 50 Gold Mine[edit]
The Hill 50 Gold Mine at Mount Magnet, in care and maintenance since December 2007, was acquired by Harmony in 2002 when the company took over Hill 50 Gold.[11] Harmony sold the operation to Monarch Gold Mining in late 2007, but Monarch was unable to complete the transaction and went into administration in July 2008.[12] After being unable to re-sell the mine, Harmony conducted a study in regards to carrying out mining at Hill 50 once more. It is currently considering the option of consolidating historic resources into one large super pit, rather than to carry out costly underground mining. Harmony expects the study to be completed in the third quarter of 2010.[13]
South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine[edit]
The South Kalgoorlie Gold Mine became part of Harmony with the take over of Hill 50 Gold. Harmony sold the mine to Dioro Exploration NL and the later settled the purchase of the mine on 30 November 2007. Harmony received A$45 million for the operations, of which $25 million were in cash while the remainder was paid in Dioro shares.[14]
Papua New Guinea[edit]
Hidden Valley[edit]
Hidden Valley is an open-pit, gold-silver mine and processing plant in Morobe Province.[15] The mine is approximately 210 km north-north-west of Port Moresby, and 90 km south-southwest of Lae.[15] It is operated by Morobe Mining Joint Ventures, a 50:50 joint venture between Harmony and Newcrest Mining.[15]
Illegal miner deaths[edit]
Main article: 2009 South African mine deaths
In late May to early June 2009 63 illegal miners died in a Free State, South Africa mine owned by Harmony Gold.[2]
Popular culture[edit]
In South Africa, Harmony Gold secured a license to sell a replica of the One Ring, made from 18 carat South African gold, mined from the area where The Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien was born. Their version of the ring, also inscribed with elvish script, sold in a variety of sizes in various jewellery stores throughout South Africa and directly through their website to anyone in the world who wanted one and could afford the $250 asking price.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
