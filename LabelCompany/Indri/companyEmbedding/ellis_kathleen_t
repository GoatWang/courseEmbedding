Experience


A licensed Realtor with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage since 1998, I have listed and sold homes from Newport Beach to San Clemente and from the coastal communities to my home in beautiful Ladera Ranch. Every neighborhood has a unique quality which resonates with buyers and I take great pleasure in tapping into those needs. Raised in a large family by a widowed mother before technology filled up our weekends, it was a common call to action on Sunday afternoons, " C'mon, I've packed a picnic. We're going for a ride." It was always an adventure and very often turned into a history lesson. So it's no surprise when people ask me how I know so much about different areas. I'm a product of my upbringing!  
As an agent with knowledge of many local areas, I bring a unique expertise about buying and selling real estate here. I welcome your business. Here are some of the things I can do for you:
Finding Your Next HomePurchasing a home is a multi-level process which begins with defining your neighborhood of choice, making sure your specific needs are being met, and navigating contracts, disclosures, inspections, and escrow processes. Working with an experienced professional like myself is essential.
Selling Your HomeWhen you sell your home, you should expect that your Realtor is up to date on current market activity, showcasing your property to potential buyers, and advising you about Disclosures, statutory and otherwise. Selling a home can be a very stressful time but streamlining the process by setting realistic expectations can make a world of difference.
 
 
As a member of the Coldwell Banker International Diamond Society, I have acquired a number of valuable certifications, including GRI ( Graduate Realtor Institute), CPRES ( Certified Probate Real Estate Specialist), CDPE ( Certified Distressed Property Expert), and SFR ( Short Sale Foreclosure Resource). The changing markets consistently challenge me to better my skills.  



Recommendations



					"Kathy Ellis worked with us in 2015 to help us find a new home in the OC. Recommended by our agent in Carlsbad, Kathy was quick to ascertain our tastes and needs. She patiently showed us many options in our preferred areas, going above and beyond to accommodate our schedules; even picking us up at the train station to avoid traffic issues. Once we found the right house, Kathy was fantastic. With an international trip planned the day after our house inspection, Kathy assured us that she would handle any details. With spotty communications and complicated negotiations, we were signing papers and packing boxes on our return! Kathy coordinated the repairs in our absence, found contractors, and made it happen. Moving into our house in October, Kathy continued to help with recommendations and getting settled. We highly recommend her. She has a calming demeanor, taking a practical approach to any challenges. We really enjoyed working with her and consider her a trusted resource and friend. "
				
   -Julie and Tim G., Client



					"I recently used Kathy to sell my home in Ladera Ranch and buy a home in Whittier. Kathy was my listing agent on my townhouse, and worked with me closely through the entire process. She helped me stage my home, and hired a professional photographer. The results were outstanding.Kathy worked with me to develop a sales price and, in the end, my townhouse sold for a fair price. The paperwork went smoothly and painlessly.I enjoyed working with Kathy so much I continued with her in the search for a home in Whittier. 50 miles away from Kathy’s office and residence, she personally set appointments to view properties. With multiple offers on a property newly listed, Kathy delivered my offer to the sellers and their agent in person, securing me a home in a charming neighborhood at a comfortable price. If I ever buy or sell again, my first choice will be Kathy."
