Title: Vice President Finance And Administratio
               Company: Egalet Corporation
Job Details
               Egalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Egalet has two approved products: OXAYDO (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only -CII and SPRIX (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. In addition, using its proprietary Guardian Technology, Egalet is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, product candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and chemical manipulation. The lead programs, ARYMO ER, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are being developed for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Egalet's Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles.

Job Details
               The Belmont Hills Civic Association is a group organized by the residents of the Belmont Hills community of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for the promotion of community welfare and the protection of the united interests of the residents of Belmont Hills and the surrounding community. The Belmont Hills community is the area bounded by East Valley Forge Road, on the south, Henderson Road on the west, South Anderson Road on the east, and East Beidler Road, Brownlie Road, and Chelsea Drive on the north. (See map.) This area is comprised of the Belmont 1 voting district and part of Belmont 3. Meetings are held monthly or bimonthly, depending on interest, at the Valley Forge Presbyterian Church. Although the church is not within the Belmont Hills area, they have been generous enough to allow us the use of their meeting room. The church is located on Town Center Road, but the parking lot is on Independence Road, off Prince Frederick.
