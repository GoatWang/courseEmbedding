Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

What our customers say ...








                                    Raising capital is arguably one of the most difficult tasks an entrepreneur faces especially at the Proof of Concept phase. Angel Investment Network worked with my team to ensure that our offering was optimally positioned and as a result we closed $2MM in funding a month later. We are now raising a much larger round as we are no longer proving the concept and we will be using this platform as a key component of our capital raise strategy.                                 







William Nobrega @ Kiseguro
 www.kiseguro.com                                        








                                    Business advice, authentic and informative discussions, and inspiration for a new wave of new businesses were some of the benefits I observed. And the Investors? Well, they were a frank, no-frills bunch - professional, yet down-to-earth, with a wealth of wisdom on their side. Very professional, outstanding.

                                    I am loving the new UI. Well done guys.  I have connected to some amazing people through this network. I have invested over 12M Rands with people I met through this portal and all except one were phenomenal investments.  Keep up the good work!

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Investment Philosophy[edit]
Capital Group's investment philosophy, based on bottom-up portfolio management and rigorous research to drive long-term investment results, has been consistent since the company was founded.[citation needed] The firm is known for its long-term focus and research-based approach and maintains a large research team that develops proprietary insights into investment decisions.[citation needed] The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups that make investment and proxy voting decisions independently.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
In 1933, Lovelace’s firm took over management of The Investment Company of America, which he had launched at E.E. MacCrone in 1927.[2] For the next 20 years, his firm enjoyed modest success.[3] As mutual funds gained in popularity in the 1950s, Capital’s roster of mutual funds grew.
The International Resources Fund, established in 1954,[4] was Capital’s first foray into international investing. A year earlier, Lovelace had established an international investment staff at the urging of his son, Jon Lovelace, Jr. The establishment of the firm’s first overseas research office in Geneva followed in 1962.[5]
In 1958, Jon Lovelace, Jr. introduced a new system of managing the firm’s mutual funds and accounts. Rather than assign a portfolio to a single manager, he divided each portfolio among several managers. Each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio. Known today as The Capital System, it avoids the phenomenon of creating single-manager “stars,” who can impact a fund’s results should they leave.[6] In the mid-1960s, Capital began to include research analysts in the management of the portfolios, reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas.[7]
Capital Group’s long-term approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms. In the late 1990s, the firm was criticized for not offering then-popular tech funds. But when the tech bubble burst, Capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon.[8]
In the early 2000s, new share classes and offerings were introduced, such as a 529 college savings plan and retirement target date funds. Named for the expected year of withdrawal, the target date funds automatically rebalance their mix of equities and fixed-income holdings as the investor approaches the expected date of retirement.
Today, Capital Group has expanded its mutual fund offerings outside the U.S. to include Europe, Canada and Asia and provides research and investment services to institutional investors around the globe.
Accolades[edit]
Morningstar found that Capital Group’s American Funds created the most wealth for investors in the period between December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2009.[9]
Many of the firm’s funds were also included in Morningstar’s “Fantastic 50” in 2015 and its “Fantastic 48” in 2014.[10]
Offices[edit]
Capital Group employs more than 7,000 associates worldwide. North American locations include Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Antonio, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C. As part of expansion plans in Europe, Capital Group established a presence in Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan and Zurich, adding to its offices in Geneva, London and Luxembourg.[11] Its Asia offices include Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo. Capital Group also has a growing presence in Sydney[12] and a private equity office in São Paulo.

Aligned With Investor Success










We base our decisions on a long-term perspective, which we believe aligns our goals with the interests of our clients. Achieving superior, long-term returns is our only goal, so managers are rewarded for their results, not the level of assets they manage. Collectively, Capital Group associates are significant investors in the company's investment offerings.












Our investment philosophy is based on doing what we believe is right for clients:
We reward long-term results Compensation paid to our investment professionals is heavily influenced by investment results over one-, three-, five- and eight-year periods. Increasing weight is placed on each successive measurement period to encourage a long-term investment approach.
We invest alongside you Collectively, Capital Group associates are significant investors in the company's investment offerings.
Why it matters:
Our interests are deeply intertwined with those of clients.





















Compensation paid to our investment professionals is heavily influenced by investment results over one-, three-, five- and eight-year periods. Increasing weight is placed on each successive measurement period to encourage a long-term investment approach.












































The Capital System℠










With each investment offering, Capital Group begins by defining a clear investment objective and assembling a diverse team best equipped to pursue the universe of opportunities available.













The Capital System is designed to enable individual investment professionals to act on their highest convictions, while limiting the risk associated with isolated decision-making.













Funds using The Capital System are divided into portions that are managed independently by investment professionals with diverse backgrounds, ages and investment approaches.

















Example: International Equity management team







 
 
 
 
 
Portfolio management team as of December 31, 2016













































The Complete Process 
Investment analysts representing a variety of geographic regions and sector concentrations follow the universe of investment opportunities identified in the investment offering.





















Pool of analyst coverage

























The Complete Process
Portfolio managers — and, notably, analysts as well — are assigned a portion, or sleeve, of the overall investment offering to manage independently, enabling them to focus on their highest conviction ideas.

























Highest conviction ideas





























The Complete Process
The Capital System bears some resemblance to a team approach. But there's an important difference: While there may be group discussions, there are no group decisions.










































The Complete Process
Overall portfolios are composed of individual managers' and analysts' highest conviction investment ideas. Combining the best independent decisions of experienced investment professionals into one portfolio results in diversification and creates the potential for superior results over time.










































The Complete Process
The end result is a diversified portfolio composed of individual managers' and analysts' highest conviction investment ideas. Combining the experienced managers' best independent decisions that are consistent with the investment offering's specific objectives delivers a portfolio with the potential for superior results over time.





















Diversified portfolio















For illustrative purposes only. In funds with research portfolios, analysts invest directly in a limited number of the companies they cover.





















































Governance 
Multiple layers of oversight contribute to rigorous risk controls
A multilayered governance structure oversees the system, enabling managers to act with confidence while managing their sleeve for optimum long-term results.














































Governance
Managers & analysts
Managers and analysts share information and opinions with their colleagues and challenge each other's decisions.










































Governance
Principal investment officer
Accountable for:
     • Overall objectives and yield targets
     • Guiding risk management and distribution of assets among managers
Portfolio Coordinating Group
Group of senior executives at Capital accountable for:
     • Portfolio manager lineup and succession planning
     • Monitoring portfolio manager results
Fund board (for mutual funds only)
Independent trustees accountable for:
     • Holding management responsible for results
     • Setting fees and renewing contracts
 
















Built to Last









As a private firm with an independent charter and robust balance sheet, we are able to invest in our capabilities through all markets, both good and bad. Our investment professionals are among the most experienced in the industry.










Experience over cycles defines our stability
     • Our portfolio managers average 27 years of experience,         including 21 years at our company.
     • The average portfolio manager tenure for the American           Funds is 9 years; for the industry, it’s 6.3 years.*
Why it matters:
Generations of knowledge over multiple full market cycles provides our clients an experience advantage.
 










*Source: Morningstar®, as of December 31, 2016. Portfolio manager and analyst data as of December 31, 2016. The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed-income investment professionals provide fixed-income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups.













“In consulting and industry circles, stability of management is often considered the best measure of investment culture. ...Creating a healthy culture where very skilled and sought after investment professionals want to stay for their whole career is one of the hardest things to do in the money management world.”
– Morningstar®, September 2012

Aligned With Investor Success
We base our decisions on a long-term perspective, which we believe aligns our goals with the interests of our clients. Our portfolio managers average 27 years of investment experience, including 21 years at our company, reflecting a career commitment to our long term approach.1
 









The Capital System℠ >

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
