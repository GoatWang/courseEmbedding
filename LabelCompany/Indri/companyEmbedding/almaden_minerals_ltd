Responsible mineral development
The Tuligtic property covers the Ixtaca Gold-Silver Deposit, one of Mexico’s premier precious metal deposits.  Ixtaca is a new discovery made by Almaden in 2010 and acquired by staking.
Drilling at Ixtaca has outlined a multimillion ounce deposit and preproduction engineering studies are underway. These will provide the necessary data for a production permit application.
Almaden has a long history of community engagement. We believe successful exploration and development make a positive social difference. By educating and employing local people and financing projects that are important to them, Almaden is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities we work with and within.

Ixtaca Gold-Silver Deposit
Overview  |   Drilling | Resource |  Economic Studies  |  Metallurgy | Mill | Reports


History of the Project
The 7,200 hectare Tuligtic claim was identified and acquired by Almaden during the company’s 2001 regional Mexican exploration program. Within this area, subsequent field work identified a 5 square hectare area of intensely altered rocks that contains several prospective targets, including the Ixtaca Zone.
In 2010, a drill program was designed to test a small outcrop. Due to the limited surface exposure of the Ixtaca vein system, three holes were fanned out in a small area, each in a different direction. In August , Almaden reported assay results from first hole ever drilled in the Ixtaca zone: TU-10-01 intersected 302.42 metres of 1.01g/t gold and 48g/t silver and multiple high grade intervals including 1.67 metres of 60.7g/t gold and 2122g/t silver.
Following Discovery Hole TU-10-01, extensive drilling has traced mineralization over one kilometer in a northeasterly orientation and showed the Main Ixtaca Zone to be a broad and robust vein system intersected by multiple high grade veinlets in a variety of orientations. Drilling has also identified two additional zones: the Ixtaca North Zone and the Northeast Extension. To date over 540 holes have been drilled in the area.
In April 2017, Almaden announced an Updated Resource Estimate and Pre-Feasibility Study ("PFS").



Location of the Project 
The project is located 120 kilometers southeast of the Pachuca Mine, one of the largest gold and silver deposits in Mexico with a historic production of 1.4 billion ounces of silver and 7 million ounces of gold. The deposit is also well-located in the industrial heart of Puebla State. It is easily accessible from Mexico City Ixtaca, and 95 kilometers north of Puebla city. A rail-serviced industrial park is 25 kilometers away, and regional power is provided by the Laguna Verde nuclear power station, located 200 kilometers to the east on a deep sea port. 

Community Involvement
Almaden has invested in the Tuligtic area since 2001. We have had over 70 local people working with Almaden in our ongoing exploration program. On behalf of our shareholders we invest in ongoing employee training programs and are actively involved in the community's health and social welfare projects. 

 To date, we have helped with local construction and improvement projects including work on a school, public bathrooms, a community hall, a local church and a hospital. See our Community Projects for more information on local projects + 
Almaden is proud to be working in Puebla and to be building long term relationships in the communities near the Ixtaca project. 

Geology of the Project 
The Ixtaca zone occurs in deformed carbonate rocks about two kilometres southwest of the Tuligtic's porphyry copper zone (drilled in 2009-2010). Surface manifestation of the Ixtaca zone is very obscure because the region is almost completely covered with volcanic ash. Reports of historic clay mines brought Almaden’s attention to the area. 
The epithermal gold-silver target area is characterised by extensively clay altered and silicified volcanic rocks. The alteration is indicative of the upper parts of an epithermal system and includes replacement silicification and sinter, the precipitate or sediment that was deposited from a hot spring. Quartz-calcite veins with textural evidence of boiling have been identified outcropping in limestone roughly 100 meters beneath the exposed sinter. 
Initial sampling of these veins and from float boulders of breccia containing quartz vein fragments returned anomalous values in gold and silver as high as 600 g/t silver and 6.1 g/t gold. The sinter and the overlying altered volcanic rocks are highly anomalous in mercury and arsenic. The Ixtaca's kaolinite and replacement silica alteration zones are typical of the surface manifestation of an ancient hotspring environment. Within the feeder faults which channel hot mineral solutions from depth to surface hotsprings, quartz, carbonate, gold and silver can deposit. 
This was the model employed by Almaden in testing the Ixtaca Zone where, in an arroyo beneath the kaolinite and silica alteration, some very narrow (0.1 to 3 centimetre) veins with epithermal textures occur in a small (about 2 metres by 5 metres) outcrop. These veins assayed up to 1 g/t gold and 110 g/t silver. Small cobbles of float in the creek returned assays of up to 600 g/t silver and another such cobble assayed 6.0 g/t gold. Work prior to drilling included a single Induced Polarization geophysical line across this area which detected a resistivity anomaly and several short geochemical soil sample lines showed coincident anomalous gold and silver values.

As described more fully in the management information circular which was mailed to shareholders of Almaden Minerals Ltd. on May 15, 2015, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada), 


each Shareholder acquired its common shares of Almadex at a cost equal to their fair market value at the Effective Time, and

each Shareholder acquired its “new” common shares of Almaden at a cost equal to the amount, if any, by which the adjusted cost base of the Shareholder’s “old” common shares of Almaden exceeds the fair market value at the Effective Time of the common shares of Almadex received under the Plan of Arrangement.

Each shareholder received 0.6 of an Almadex share for each Almaden share held. Almaden has obtained a professional valuation which ascribes to the common shares of Almadex at the Effective Time (as at July 30, 2015) an aggregate fair market value of CAD$14.76 million, which equates to CAD$0.336 per common share, or CAD$0.202 for each 0.6 of a Common share of Almadex.

Almaden will prepare its tax returns based on this valuation, and believes that it would be reasonable for the Shareholders to also rely on the valuation for their own tax purposes.  However the valuation is not binding on the Canada Revenue Agency.
The foregoing is qualified entirely by the Circular and is not intended to be tax advice to any particular Shareholder.  Shareholders are encouraged to read the Circular in full and to consult with their own tax advisors having regard to their own circumstances.

CSR Report


"Almaden is committed to improving the quality of life in the communities with which we work." 
Morgan Poliquin, President of Almaden
We believe in supporting the local communities within which we work. Over the years, Almaden has been involved in many large construction projects including building and improving schools, health care facilities, and roads. 
We have also invested in smaller projects like purchasing school books and computers for students and wheelchairs for adults and children with mobility issues. Also, by employing local people, Almaden invests in local economies which keeps communities together and strong.
Below are some of the recent community projects in which Almaden has been involved. 

Our 19th Mine Tour
Almaden has just concluded our 
19th tour of mines in Mexico. So far 380 people from the local communities around Ixtca have visited modern mines.
This last trip was particularly important, as members from Ixtaca and El Cobre came with us. It was a very successful trip.






Día de Muertos
Almaden recently participated in a Day of the Dead Festival, which was attended by approximately 250 people from four different communities. Almaden representatives, along with teachers in the communities organized a Day of the Dead play, as well as traditional dancing activities.






Presentation of Scholarships to Local Students
On Tuesday September 22, 2015, Almaden representatives presented an additional 15 local students with academic scholarships. Almaden has now awarded a total of 40 scholarships to local students.

The students are from 12 local communities, and are pursuing training in law, psychology, architecture and business administration.
All of us at Almaden wish these students continued success in their fields of study!


Opening of the Public Buildings in Santa Maria Zotoltepec
Almaden Minerals funded the building of new public washrooms, an addition to the Mother & Child health clinic, and an extra room on the elementary school in the town of Santa Maria Zotoltepec. The official opening ceremonies included a dinner and party. Duane and Morgan Poliquin attended the opening ceremonies, and Morgan cut ribbons at each venue. 







Reforestation Program at the Ixtaca Zone,
    Tuligtic Project
Almaden has initiated a reforestation programs around the drill sites on the Ixtaca Zone. The plants selected for the program are three varieties of indigenous pine.  Four men from the local community have been employed for the planting, which was timed to the beginning of the rainy season to ensure successful planting. The text and images below explain the process and ongoing work.
The reforestation program is intended to benefit the people living in the community of Santa Maria Zotoltepec. The increased awareness of the conservation and importance of indigineous plants. The project has also given income to eleven people from the community, who had no fixed means of income.
Training and equipping staff: Local men were hired to carry out the reforestation program. Training focussed on sensitivity to the project, caring for the environment, and the importance of wearing protective equipment. 
Selection of species: The selection of species for reforestation program was based on the type of vegetation found in the project area, in this case three species of indigenous pine. 


Corner Hill Nursery Sebastopol, Aquixtla, Puebla
  



Transporting the seedlings



Site preparation: the seedlings were planted on a grid system.       Organic fertisizers acquired from the Jacarandas Garden Centre were added to the soil to ensure a nutrient rich base for the seedlings.




Planting was timed to the beginning of the rainy season in June to ensure the best possible start for the seedlings.




Almaden Sponsors the Wheelchair Foundation
In cooperation with the Wheelchair Foundation, Almaden helped sponsor the purchase of over 260 wheelchairs, which were distributed in Puebla, Veracruz, and Oaxaca States in April 2012. 
 The Wheelchair Foundation is a non-profit charitable organization with a goal to provide a free wheelchair to every child, teen and adult worldwide who needs one, but has no means to acquire one. To date, they have distributed over 900,000 wheelchairs worldwide. 
 Almaden's Chairman and President, Duane and Morgan Poliquin, were in Puebla for the presentation. Please visit our blog for more images from the Wheelchair Foundation's presentation ceremony.

Expert Comments:



The Gold Report Interview with Bob Moriarty 

(11/30/15)

		
		"Almaden Minerals Ltd.is an absolutely perfect example of value-added thinking, Bob Moriarty says. "I happen to like the father/son management team of Duane and Morgan Poliquin. I have been to the project and love it. The company is moving toward production on the Tuligtic project in Puebla, Mexico. It spun the other assets off as Almadex Minerals in a 2-for-1 special for shareholders. 

"That's a perfect example of what you need to do in a market bottom. Investors tend to forget that commodities move up and down and you can't kill a project because today's price is too low. You have to weather through it. Is Almaden going to be able to produce silver and gold at a profit at a 5-year/10-year trading average? My belief is absolutely yes, so I don't care what the price is today. I want to see it move forward. The cost of diesel is cheap. The cost of iron is cheap. The cost of labor is cheap. It's a tremendous opportunity to take advantage of that."If you go down to your local Corvette dealer and a brand new Corvette was quoted to you six months ago at $70M, but today the same red sports car is on special for $6M, that sounds like a hell of a deal to me." Almaden applied that logic to its recent purchase of the barely used 7,000 ton-per-day capacity Rock Creek mill, a move that could reduce the initial capital cost estimate of ramp-up for Ixtaca by $70M. "It was an absolutely brilliant move on Almaden's part," Moriarty says.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
