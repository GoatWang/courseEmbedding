Montelukast Session
Vienna, Austria 
Repurposing Of The Anti-asthmatic Drug Montelukast For The Treatment Of Alzheimer’s Disease, 13 International Conference on Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s Diseases
More Information
Scientific Program












  FOR TREATMENT OF DEGENERATIVE DISEASES OF THE BRAINMontelukast (INT0043) is a unique drug repurposing opportunity for the treatment of degenerative diseases of the brain, such as: mild cognitive impairment, alzheimers disease or dementia. The goal is to develop a montelukast oral film product based on the VersaFilm™ proprietary thin film technology by using an already FDA approved drug (Singulair) that has demonstrated potential for the treatment of degenerative diseases of the brain. IntelGenx is currently undergoing a Phase 1 trial and is looking for a partnership or alliance opportunity to complete the development and commercialize Montelukast.Montelukast (trade name Singulair) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used for the maintenance treatment of asthma and to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. Montelukast is a CysLT1 antagonist; it blocks the action of leukotriene D4 (and secondary ligands LTC4 and LTE4) on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene and results in less inflammation.The “Mont” in Montelukast stands for Montreal, the place where Merck developed the drug.

 INDICATED FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTIONINT0007 is a tadalafil film is a new product opportunity formulated using VersaFilm™, IntelGenx’s proprietary thin film technology. Tadalafil is one of the three major PDE5 inhibitors in the erectile dysfunction market. Compared with the competitors, tadalafil shows longer duration of action and less food effect. IntelGenx’s tadalafil film offers an improved discrete dosage form that does not require water intake. IntelGenx tadalafil film formulations have been tested in various clinical trials to improve the pharmacokinetics and optimize the formulation. The latest formulation successfully demonstrated bioequivalence to Cialis® tablet in a pilot study. Tadalafil film’s development program targets launch readiness ahead of Cialis® patent expiry, which could lead to tadalafil VersaFilm™ being the first competitor to Cialis® tablets. IntelGenx is currently looking for a partnership or alliance opportunity to complete development and commercialize tadalafil VersaFilmTM.

Why invest in IntelGenx



Why invest in IntelGenx ?

Our business strategy is to apply our drug delivery technologies to improve existing drug compounds with proven efficacy and safety and, in conjunction with strategic development and distribution partners, reintroduce these drug compounds to the market as branded products with improved deliverability and efficacy. Because we are developing improved formulations of currently marketed therapeutics, our products typically require fewer clinical trials to generate the safety and efficacy data needed to achieve regulatory approval than drug formulations that have not been previously marketed. As a result, we believe we can accelerate development and reduce risk compared to traditional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.


IntelGenx Technologies Corp. (OTCMKTS:IGXT) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a note issued to investors. Click Here for a more information




Focused on capturing large share of innovative oral thin films market.

    Upcoming Milestones 2017 :  Patent ruling regarding Par Pharma product in June  NDA submission for tadalafil (erectile dysfunction) thin-film version of Blockbuster drug Cialis in June or July  NDA resubmission for Rizaport (migraine) in early Q3  Partnership for Tadalafil in 2H 2017    IntelGenx has multi-faceted BD approach for its oral films  May 16, 2017 http://www.biotuesdays.com/features/2017/5/11/intelgenx-has-multi-faceted-bd-approach-for-its-oral-films  IntelGenx previously confirmed the bioequivalence of Tadalafil to Eli Lilly’s Cialis, which had sales of $1.5-billion in 2016 but faces generic competition in 2020. IntelGenx has an exclusive license for oral films from Lilly for its dosing patent, which would allow Tadalafil to enter the ED market in the U.S. free from patent litigation from Lilly. Dr. Matzen explains that Tadalafil, which offers a discrete dosing alternative, could enter the market in 2018, with up to three years of market exclusivity before Cialis is hit with generic competition.     IntelGenx Technologies Corp (OTCMKTS:IGXT) Is Today’s Pharma Focus http://www.insiderfinancial.com/intelgenx-technologies-corp-otcmktsigxt-is-todays-pharma-focus/116698/  Currently trading with a market cap of $39 million, IGXT is one OTC pharma stock that has a lot in the pipeline. All it needs is one product to hit, and the company will be worth 10x its current market cap. IGXT has multi-bagger written all over it.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Charges dropped after ‘London Whale’ accused Jamie Dimon of making him a fall guy
              
              The case against two traders in the infamous “London Whale” case appears to have fallen apart after the Whale himself, considered a key witness, accused J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of setting him up as a fall guy.

Your personalized new promotional products will do more than offer people an item that they can use constantly; they will promote your business and remind people that you are just a phone call away.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.
