Frontier Funds // Netols Small Cap Value // Overview













Netols Small Cap Value
OverviewQuarterlyHistorical NAVs

Effective July 1, 2017, the Frontier Netols Small Cap Value Fund is subadvised by Phocas Financial Corp.  Please see the prospectus for more information.
 
Investment Objective 

The Frontier Netols Small Cap Value Fund's goal, also referred to as its investment objective, is capital appreciation. 

Principal Investment Strategy 

The Fund seeks to achieve its goal primarily through investment in a diversified portfolio of equity securities of companies with small market capitalizations. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in domestic common stocks and other equity securities (including convertible preferred stocks and warrants) of small-capitalization companies, consistent with companies within the Russell 2000® Value Index.
 
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a diversified portfolio of small-capitalization securities selling at discounts to their fair value as assessed by the investment and research team of Phocas Financial Corporation (“Phocas”), the Fund’s subadviser.  Phocas will typically invest in 80 to 120 companies with initial weightings between 0.50% to 1.50% of the Fund’s total assets in order to have broad industry representation and reduce individual security risk within the Fund.

The recent growth in the equity market has helped to produce short-term returns for some asset classes that are not typical and may not continue in the future. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.

Pursuant to an expense cap agreement between the Fund’s adviser, Frontegra Asset Management, Inc. (“Frontegra”) and the Fund, Frontegra agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund’s operating expenses to the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund’s total operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses) do not exceed 1.50% of the Fund's average daily net assets for Class Y shares and 1.10% of the Fund’s average daily net assets for Institutional Class shares. Effective July 1, 2017, the Fund's expense caps are reduced to 1.35% and 0.95% of the Fund's average daily net assets for Class Y shares and Institutional Class shares, respectively.  The expense cap agreement for the Fund will continue in effect until October 31, 2019, with successive renewal terms of one year unless terminated by Frontegra or the Fund prior to any such renewal. “Other Expenses” are presented before any waivers or expense reimbursements.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. The principal value of an investment and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted and may be obtained by calling 888-825-2100. Investment performance reflects contractual fee waivers in effect. In the absence of such waiver, total returns would be reduced.

The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the Frontier Funds, and it may be obtained by downloading or calling 888-825-2100. To download, select the Prospectus option located on the right sidebar.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.

Principal Risk Factors. The main risks of investing in the Fund are:

Market Risks. The Fund’s investments are subject to market risk, which may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline. If the value of the Fund’s investments goes down, you may lose money. The share price of the Fund is expected to fluctuate. Your shares at redemption may be worth less than your initial investment. U.S. and international markets have experienced extreme volatility, reduced liquidity, credit downgrades, increased likelihood of default and valuation difficulties in recent years.

Stock Selection Risks. The stocks selected for the Fund may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising.

Small Capitalization Risks. The Fund will invest primarily in securities of companies with small market capitalizations, which are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger companies. The frequency and volume of trading in securities of small capitalization companies may be substantially less than is typical of larger companies. Therefore, the securities of small capitalization companies may be subject to greater and more abrupt price fluctuations than larger companies. In addition, small capitalization companies may lack the management experience, financial resources and product diversification of larger companies, making them more susceptible to market pressures. Generally, the smaller the company size, the greater these risks.

Equity Security Risks. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks and other equity securities. Common stocks and other equity securities generally increase or decrease in value based on the earnings of a company and on general industry and market conditions. A fund that invests a significant amount of its assets in common stocks and other equity securities is likely to have greater fluctuations in share price than a fund that invests a significant portion of its assets in fixed income securities.

Value Investing Risks. The Fund invests in primarily value-style stocks, stocks whose prices the portfolio manager believes are undervalued in relation to fundamental measures. Value stocks may never increase in price or pay dividends as anticipated by the portfolio manager, or may decline even further if the market fails to recognize the company’s value, if the factors that the portfolio manager believes will increase the price do not occur or if a stock judged to be undervalued is actually appropriately priced.

Management Risk. The Fund is subject to management risk as an actively-managed investment portfolio. 


Sector Risks.  Although Phocas selects stocks based on their individual merits, some economic sectors will represent a larger portion of the Fund's overall investment portfolio than other sectors.  Potential negative market or economic developments affecting one of the larger sectors could have a greater impact on the Fund than on a fund with fewer holdings in that sector.  Given the current composition of the Russell 2000®  Value Index, the Fund may invest a relatively large percentage of its assets in the financial sector and, therefore, the Fund's performance may be adversely affected by volatility in financial and credit markets.  Financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation, interest rate risk, credit losses and price competition, among other factors.


High Portfolio Turnover Risks.  During the initial period of Phocas' management of the Fund, the Fund may experience a high portfolio turnover rate (over 100%).  High portfolio turnover is likely to lead to increased Fund expenses, such as brokerage commissions and other transaction costs.  Additionally, a high portfolio turnover rate may result in higher short-term capital gains taxable to shareholders and in lower investment returns.  


The Frontier Funds are not offered for sale in countries other than the United States and its territories.

Phocas Small Cap Value
OverviewQuarterlyHistorical NAVs

Investment Objective

The Frontier Phocas Small Cap Value Fund's goal, also referred to as its investment objective, is long-term total investment return through capital appreciation.

Principal Investment Strategy 

The Fund seeks to achieve its goal primarily through investing at least 80% of its net assets in domestic common stocks and other equity securities (including convertible preferred stocks and warrants) of small-capitalization companies, consistent with companies within the Russell 2000® Value Index. For purposes of the 80% policy, net assets include any borrowings for investment purposes.

The Fund will pursue its investment objective by investing in a diversified portfolio of small-capitalization securities selling at discounts to their fair value as assessed by the investment and research team of Phocas Financial Corporation ("Phocas"), the Fund's subadviser. Phocas will typically invest in 80 to 120 companies with initial weightings between 0.50% to 1.50% of total Fund value in order to have broad industry representation and reduce individual security risk within the Fund.

The performance of the Frontier Phocas Small Cap Value Fund reflects historical performance of the Phocas Small CapValue Fund (the "Predecessor Fund"). Effective October 8, 2010, the Predecessor Fund was reorganized into the Fund. Returns since October 8, 2010, reflect the performance of the Fund's Class L Shares. Effective November 1, 2012, the Class L shares were redesignated as Institutional Class shares.

The recent growth in the equity market has helped to produce short-term returns for some asset classes that are not typical and may not continue in the future. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.

Pursuant to an expense cap agreement between the Fund’s adviser, Frontegra Asset Management, Inc. (“Frontegra”) and the Fund, Frontegra agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund’s operating expenses to the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund’s total operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses) do not exceed 1.10% of the Fund’s average daily net assets. Effective July 1, 2017, the Fund's expense caps are reduced to 0.95% and 1.10% of the Fund's average daily net assets for Institutional Class shares and Service Class shares, respectively.  The expense cap agreement for the Fund will continue in effect until October 31, 2019, with successive renewal terms of one year unless terminated by Frontegra or the Fund prior to any such renewal. “Other Expenses” are presented before any waivers or expense reimbursements.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. The principal value of an investment and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted and may be obtained by calling 888-825-2100. Investment performance reflects contractual fee waivers in effect. In the absence of such waiver, total returns would be reduced.

The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the Frontier Funds, and it may be obtained by downloading or calling 888-825-2100. To download, select the Prospectus option located on the right sidebar.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.

Principal Risk Factors. The main risks of investing in the Fund are:

Market Risks. The Fund’s investments are subject to market risk, which may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline. If the value of the Fund’s investments goes down, the share price of the Fund will go down, and you may lose money. U.S. and international markets have experienced extreme volatility, reduced liquidity, credit downgrades, increased likelihood of default and valuation difficulties in recent years.

Equity Securities Risks. Common stocks and other equity securities held by the Fund will fluctuate in value based on earnings of the company and on general industry and market conditions, leading to fluctuations in the Fund's share price.

Foreign Securities Risks. The Fund's foreign investments involve additional risks, including less liquidity, currency-rate fluctuations, political and economic instability and differences in financial reporting standards and securities market regulation.

Management Risks. The Fund is subject to management risk as an actively-managed investment portfolio and depends on the decisions of the portfolio managers to produce the desired results.

Small Capitalization Risks. Securities of companies with small market capitalizations, are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger companies. Small capitalization companies are also more susceptible to market pressures than larger companies.

Value Investing Risks. The Fund invests primarily in value-style stocks, stocks whose prices Phocas believes are undervalued in relation to fundamental measures. Value stocks may never increase in price or pay dividends as anticipated by Phocas, or may decline even further if the market fails to recognize the company's value, if the factors that Phocas believes will increase the price do not occur or if a stock judged to be undervalued is actually appropriately priced.

Sector Risks. Although Phocas selects stocks based on their individual merits, some economic sectors will represent a larger portion of the Fund's overall investment portfolio than other sectors. Potential negative market or economic developments affecting one of the larger sectors could have a greater impact on the Fund than on a fund with fewer holdings in that sector.

The Frontier Funds are not offered for sale in countries other than the United States and its territories.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.

Principal Risk Factors. The main risks of investing in the Fund are:

Market Risks. The Fund's investments are subject to market risk, which may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. If the value of the Fund's investments goes down, the share price of the Fund will go down, and you may lose money. U.S. and international markets have experienced extreme volatility, reduced liquidity, credit downgrades, increased likelihood of default and valuation difficulties in recent years.

Equity Securities Risks. Common stocks and other equity securities held by the Fund will fluctuate in value based on the earnings of the company and on general industry and market conditions, leading to fluctuations in the Fund's share price.

Stock Selection Risks. The stocks selected for the Fund may decline in value or not increase in value when the stock market in general is rising.

Foreign Securities Risks. Investments in securities of foreign companies involve additional risks, including less liquidity, currency-rate fluctuations, political and economic instability and differences in financial reporting standards and securities market regulation.

American Depositary Receipts Risks (“ADRs”). The risks of ADRs include many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign securities, such as currency-rate fluctuations and political and economic instability.

Frontier Markets Risks. Investments in frontier markets can involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign markets. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets and, as a result, the risks of investing in emerging markets countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Frontier market economies can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties, including the repatriation of investment income, and return of capital on the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors.

Emerging Markets Risks. Emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments, weaker economies and less developed legal systems with fewer securities holder rights. Emerging market economies may be based on only a few industries and security issuers may be more susceptible to economic weakness and more likely to default. Emerging market securities also tend to be less liquid.

Valuation Risks. The sale price the Fund could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology.

Financial Services Sector Risks. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the financial services sector, the Fund will be sensitive to changes in, and its performance will depend to a greater extent on, the overall condition of the financial services sector. Companies in the financial services sector may be subject to extensive government regulation that affects the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain.

Currency Risks. The value of the Fund's foreign holdings as measured in U.S. dollars may be affected unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Fund may also incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies.

Small- and Medium-Capitalization Company Risks. Small-capitalization and medium- capitalization companies are often more volatile and less liquid than investments in larger companies. The frequency and volume of trading in securities of medium-capitalization and small-capitalization companies may be substantially less than is typical of larger companies.

P-Note Risks. P-Notes are issued by banks or broker-dealers and are designed to offer a return linked to the performance of an underlying security or market. The risks of P-Notes include many of the risks associated investing directly in foreign securities. Additionally, P- Notes may be subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the broker-dealer or bank that issues the notes will not fulfill its contractual obligations under the notes.

New Fund Risks. The Fund is a new mutual fund, which has no history of operations. Silk has not previously acted as an investment adviser or subadviser to an investment company registered with the SEC. As the subadviser to a mutual fund, Silk will be subject to additional limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size.

Management Risks. The Fund is subject to management risk as an actively-managed investment portfolio and depends on the decisions of the portfolio manager to produce the desired results.

Liquidity Risks. From time to time, the trading market for a particular security or type of security in which the Fund invests may become less liquid or even illiquid. The Fund may not be able to sell certain securities when Silk considers it desirable to do so and/or may have to sell the security at a lower price. Market prices for such securities may be volatile.

Cybersecurity Risks. Despite the various protections utilized by the Fund and its service providers, systems, networks, or devices utilized by the Fund potentially can be breached. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result of a cybersecurity breach.

The Frontier Funds are not offered for sale in countries other than the United States and its territories.

“Gavin worked his way up through the tough managerial ranks of local journalism in the UK then established himself as a rock of emerging markets journalism in the fast-moving Bloomberg environment.  It takes a particular kind of bright and ambitious person to succeed both at being a highly-valued journalist and managing them effectively.  I have spoken to him and read his articles for years, and was particularly pleased to be asked to review his book Frontier, which gives a great flavour of what emerging markets investing is like on the ground.”

“Gavin is the only journalist that has accompanied me on an investment trip, and I was highly impressed by his interesting and pertinent questions with various officials in Nigeria. He combines discretion, accuracy and integrity with a flare for the energy and excitement of the emerging markets – as evidenced by his highly acclaimed book and Aberdeen’s ongoing engagement through conferences and various media activities.”

Please click here for Index Definitions. 
Fund returns are net of fees. Index returns are net of withholding taxes.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The information contained herein concerns a sub-fund (the “Fund”) of Harding Loevner Funds plc (the “Company”), an umbrella-type open-ended investment company authorized in Ireland as an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (a “UCITS”) pursuant to the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations, as amended.  Harding Loevner LP is the investment manager of the Company.   The investments of the Fund in securities are subject to normal market fluctuations and other risks inherent in investing in securities. The value of investments and the income from them, and therefore the value of and income from Shares relating to each Fund can go down as well as up and an investor may not get back the amount he invests. Changes in exchange rates between currencies or the conversion from one currency to another may also cause the value of the investments to diminish or increase. An investment in a Fund should not constitute a substantial proportion of an investment portfolio and may not be appropriate for all investors.  For further discussion of risk factors, refer to the Risk Factors section of the Company’s prospectus and the applicable Fund’s Supplement to the Prospectus. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objective will be achieved and investment results may vary substantially over time. This document is for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer or invitation to purchase shares in the Fund and has not been prepared in connection with any such offer or invitation.  MSCI Inc. and S&P do not make any express or implied warranties or representations and shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to any GICS data contained herein.

P/E Ratio
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/E is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s earnings per share. Negative P/E ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 20-Jul-2017



13.01




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 20-Jul-2017

Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



12.05%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 30-Jun-2017



2.06%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.04%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.


Frontier markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors and may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in more developed and emerging markets.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

Investment Approach

We seek to identify markets with the best secular growth opportunities and those where sentiment and valuation lag fundamental improvement. With different drivers for each country and region, we believe frontier markets represent an excellent opportunity for clients with existing emerging markets exposure to diversify their portfolios further by investing in areas that are historically uncorrelated with both developed and more-established emerging markets.

Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income).  Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year.  Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I, and Class IS shares are not subject to a sales charge.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/ or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current prospectus. The minimum initial investment is $5,000,000 for Class I shares.

Performance shown for the Fund’s Class I shares reflects the performance of the common shares of the Frontier Predecessor Fund for periods prior to September 17, 2012.

The Fund has suspended offering Class L shares of the Portfolio to all investors.
Class IS shares, are  being offered only to eligible investors who must meet a minimum initial investment of $10,000,000 or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in each case subject to the discretion of the Portfolio's investment advisor.
Pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization between Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc., on behalf of the Fund, and Morgan Stanley Frontier Emerging Markets Fund, Inc. (the “Frontier Predecessor Fund”), on September 17, 2012 the Fund acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the Frontier Predecessor Fund in exchange for Class I shares of the Fund (the “Frontier Reorganization”). As a result of the Frontier Reorganization, the Fund is the accounting successor of the Frontier Predecessor Fund. The historical performance information shown reflects, for the period prior to the Frontier Reorganization, the historical performance of the Frontier Predecessor Fund. The Frontier Predecessor Fund may have performed differently if it were an open-end fund since closed-end funds are generally not subject to the cash flow fluctuations of an open-end fund. 

Effective on February 27, 2015, Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. Frontier Emerging Markets Portfolio began offering Class IS shares. Class IS Shares of the Fund are being offered only to eligible investors who must meet a minimum initial investment of $10 million or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan with minimum plan assets of $250 million, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in each case subject to the discretion of the Fund’s investment adviser.

 Effective March 31, 2017, the name of the Portfolio was changed from Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. Frontier Emerging Markets Portfolio to Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund, Inc. Frontier Markets Portfolio. There were no other changes to the Portfolio or investment process. 

 Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.

 Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition and Characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors or region presented. 

 Returns are net of fees and assume the reinvestment of all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary.

 Please keep in mind that double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITIONS 
 Price/earnings (P/E) is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share. Sometimes called the multiple, P/E gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company’s earning power. The higher the P/E, the more investors are paying, and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years. Earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding. Market capitalization is the total dollar market value of all of a company's outstanding shares.

Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.

 The index data displayed under allocations are calculated using MSIM and other third-party methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor.

Forecast and estimates are subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass due to changing market and/or economic conditions. 

 RISK/RETURN DEFINITIONS
Alpha is the excess return or value added (positive or negative) of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark. Beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the market's upward or downward movements. A beta greater than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market. The Beta of the Market is always equal to 1. Information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk, as measured by tracking error, versus the portfolio’s benchmark. R squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index. An R squared of 100 means the portfolio performance is 100% correlated to the index’s, whereas a low r-squared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s. Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the historical risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviationmeasures how widely individual performance returns, within a performance series, are dispersed from the average or mean value. Tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark. Upside/downside market capture measures performance in up/ down markets relative to the market benchmark.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS
 There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and that the value of Portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in frontier emerging markets are greater than risks associated with investments in other foreign or U.S. issuers and they are often considered highly speculative in nature. Investment opportunities in many frontier emerging markets may be concentrated in the banking industry, which could have a disproportionate impact on the portfolio’s performance. Stocks of small- and medium- capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. By investing in investment company securities, the portfolio is subject to the underlying risks of that investment company's portfolio securities. In addition to the Portfolio's fees and expenses, the Portfolio generally would bear its share of the investment company's fees and expenses. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk).

Morningstar
 Rankings: The percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges, but do include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and Rule 12b-1 fees. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
 The MSCI Frontier Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of frontier markets. The term "free float" represents the portion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. The MSCI Frontier Markets Index currently consists of 24 frontier market country indices. The performance of the Index is calculated in U.S. dollars and assumes reinvestment of net dividends. “Net dividends” reflects a reduction in dividends after taking into account withholding of taxes by certain foreign countries represented in the Index. The index is unmanaged and does not include any expenses, fees or sales charges. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

  Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.
 




 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
