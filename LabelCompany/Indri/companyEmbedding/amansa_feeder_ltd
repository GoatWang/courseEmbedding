Data Feed Whitepaper:
3 Strategies to Help You Take Control of Your Brand's Digital Footprint












Internalizing the "product content is king" mantra within a brand organization comes with its set of challenges. Previously, separation from consumers made brands one step removed from the selling process. But today, retailers are realizing that in order to make their omnichannel initiatives successful, they need the brands to provide the quality product content that drives discoverability and conversion.But as brands feel the pressure of that accountability, “product content is king” should not be just about keeping retailers happy. Like the retailers, savvy brands will see it as an opportunity to create great relationships with their retail partners and merchandise their products directly to the consumer.Get Your Free Copy

SUPERIOR-PHS GENERAL TERMS & CONDITIONS
	  Lead Times
All lead times are based from receipt of deposit. 
	 Superior-PHS will make every effort to meet or exceed its estimated lead 
	 times/delivery dates; however, delays due to external factors beyond our 
	 control, such as vendor delays and delay due to natural disasters and/or 
	 weather may extend promised lead times.

Order Cancellation Prior to Shipment

Due to the cost of processing orders and the cost of materials 
	and inventory, Superior-PHS charges a minimum 20% order cancellation fee on 
	all cancelled orders for standard product.  Custom build and 
	build-to-order equipment and systems may have a higher cancellation rate and 
	the rate may escalate each month from receipt of order.  The 
	cancellation fee and rate schedule varies with the amount of custom and 
	project work required for the equipment or system.  The highest 
	cancellation fees for a custom designed system is 50% if cancelled in first 
	30 days from receipt of order, 85% if within first 60 days, 95% if within 90 
	days, and 100% if over 90 days.  Your system proposal may detail the 
	cancellation.  Your system proposal may, but not necessarily, include 
	the cancellation fee schedule.  If it does not, please inquire and we 
	will provide.
 
Returns
Superior-PHS does not accept returns for ordered 
	items. Superior-PHS makes every effort to ensure that products shipped are 
	right for their application. Superior-PHS requests detailed application 
	specifications and test samples which we review and test prior to proposing 
	a solution. Superior-PHS provides the opportunity for each customer to 
	inspect, test, and accept their product prior to shipment from the factory. 
	Any issues customers have can be addressed prior to shipment. If a customer 
	waives the opportunity to inspect and test their product prior to shipping, 
	the customer automatically accepts the product. 
***The above terms and conditions are in addition to 
	any and all other terms and conditions as part of equipment proposals and 
	orders.***

About Us ...
Superior Paper Handling Solutions, Inc.


		  Get More for Less with Superior-PHS! 
		  We set priority on ingenuity and inventiveness in an otherwise 
		  stagnant fulfillment industry. While others are playing catch-up, we 
		  are constantly moving forward to improve our customer’s bottom line 
		  and continually define state-of-the-art in the industry. We challenge 
		  our competitors to deliver a more robust, high-performing product at a 
		  better value than Superior-PHS. Which is why we pose the question:
		  

WHY WOULD YOU GO ANYWHERE ELSE?
In 2005, Superior-PHS started as "two guys in a garage" 
				  building automated solutions for print, mail, and packaging 
				  professionals. Despite combating a struggling economic 
				  environment, Superior-PHS has grown to be the world's fastest 
				  growing provider of friction feeding, batch counting, 
				  integrated transport and collation systems on the market.

 Superior 
				  has the unique advantage 
				  to have specialized knowledge of all industry brands and 
				  equipment including friction feeders, wrappers and tunnels, banders, 
				  tabbers, ink-jet printers, bindery equipment, mailing 
				  equipment, inserts, collating and kitting systems, and so much 
				  more. Superior-PHS is a "One-Stop-Shop" for a vast resource of 
				  industry knowledge and the product selection to offer simple 
				  solutions up to fully automated and integrated systems.
The company's continued growth and success is credited to 
				  the goal of providing industry professionals a product line 
				  that is far superior to the competition at an exceptional value. 
				  Robust, modular, and easy-to-use product features combined 
				  with industry expert knowledge make Superior-PHS the obvious

We cater to investors looking for absolute returns over a long term time horizon. Our mission is to use our knowledge, expertise and corporate network to unearth quality, long term investment opportunities that help our investors make the most of their capital, without being tied to a particular benchmark or index.

SUPERIOR-PHS GENERAL TERMS & CONDITIONS
	  Lead Times
All lead times are based from receipt of deposit. 
	 Superior-PHS will make every effort to meet or exceed its estimated lead 
	 times/delivery dates; however, delays due to external factors beyond our 
	 control, such as vendor delays and delay due to natural disasters and/or 
	 weather may extend promised lead times.

Order Cancellation Prior to Shipment

Due to the cost of processing orders and the cost of materials 
	and inventory, Superior-PHS charges a minimum 20% order cancellation fee on 
	all cancelled orders for standard product.  Custom build and 
	build-to-order equipment and systems may have a higher cancellation rate and 
	the rate may escalate each month from receipt of order.  The 
	cancellation fee and rate schedule varies with the amount of custom and 
	project work required for the equipment or system.  The highest 
	cancellation fees for a custom designed system is 50% if cancelled in first 
	30 days from receipt of order, 85% if within first 60 days, 95% if within 90 
	days, and 100% if over 90 days.  Your system proposal may detail the 
	cancellation.  Your system proposal may, but not necessarily, include 
	the cancellation fee schedule.  If it does not, please inquire and we 
	will provide.
 
Returns
Superior-PHS does not accept returns for ordered 
	items. Superior-PHS makes every effort to ensure that products shipped are 
	right for their application. Superior-PHS requests detailed application 
	specifications and test samples which we review and test prior to proposing 
	a solution. Superior-PHS provides the opportunity for each customer to 
	inspect, test, and accept their product prior to shipment from the factory. 
	Any issues customers have can be addressed prior to shipment. If a customer 
	waives the opportunity to inspect and test their product prior to shipping, 
	the customer automatically accepts the product. 
***The above terms and conditions are in addition to 
	any and all other terms and conditions as part of equipment proposals and 
	orders.***

				  more. Superior-PHS is a "One-Stop-Shop" for a vast resource of 
				  industry knowledge and the product selection to offer simple 
				  solutions up to fully automated and integrated systems.
The company's continued growth and success is credited to

				  that is far superior to the competition at an exceptional value.

				  development and customer service came together from industry 
				  leading 
				  companies to start Superior-PHS with a wealth of industry 
				  knowledge and experience. 
 Our passion is to find industry professionals cost-effective 
		  solutions for increasing profits through efficient and productive 
		  automated systems. "We're not here to sell equipment; we're here to 
		  find customers' solutions," SPHS President.

		  forward to providing you with an economical solution for increasing 
		  your productivity through automation.
