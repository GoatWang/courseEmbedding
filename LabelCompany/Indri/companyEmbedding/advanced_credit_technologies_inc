The impending launch in the USA, the world's largest payments market, is a key milestone in the company's history. Prior to official "launch" of the TurnScor Card, ACRT will be offering "FREE" access to the credit repair platform (www.turnscor.com) to the registered visitors of TurnScor Card website (www.turnscorcard.com) to further inquire and learn all of the benefits the TurnScor Card.Chris Jackson, President of ACRT, said, "At ACRT, we have developed an exceptionally robust and flexible credit repair platform to help American consumers achieve their financial dreams.
