“My wife and I thank you VERY MUCH for the excellent job you recently performed cleaning out the ducts and equipment in the apartment we are renting. My 9 year old son had a terrible cough with mucus for many months, as had I. Within 48 hours after your cleaning the system, the coughing almost disappeared completely … on both of us. From this point forward, I have learned my lesson on how critical it is to have all ducts cleaned at least every few years, once I have purchased our home. Feel free to offer me as a reference to your future clients.” – Doug K. (5-21-15)
“I want to tell you what a swell job they did. And also they cleaned out the furnace. We have had the ducts cleaned every other year or so, pretty religiously since we moved in here, because we have dogs that have a lot of hair and dander. But since we’ve been here, nobody has ever cleaned our furnace, and they got out about 10 pounds of dirt out of the furnace, it was unbelievable. They were fantastic. Thank you so much, guys.” – Gloria S. (10-29-14)
“We had just had our house repainted and new wood floors installed so we had dust everywhere. We were anxious to get the vents cleaned so we could get the house back in order. We called Americlean to see if they could send someone out on short notice (and on a Saturday to boot) and they were able to accommodate us. The two technicians they sent out worked for almost 7 hours straight without a break. They were very professional and did a great job of cleaning up before they left. I would definitely use them again.” – Judith B. (12-29-12)

Americlean is top rated by the Washington’s Consumer Checkbook and Angie’s List.

Dryer Vent Cleaning | Americlean

Dryer Vent Cleaning


A dryer vent with significant lint buildup can overheat, posing a serious fire hazard. Even minor blockage will hurt your dryer’s efficiency and increase your energy bill. If you notice your dryer is taking a longer time to cycle or you need to run it twice for the same load, it’s time to get the dryer vent cleaned.
Typically you should have your dryer vent cleaned at least once or twice a year. You may need to clean it with greater frequency depending on the length of your vent and the amount you use it. Not only will a dryer vent cleaning make your home safer, but you’ll also help extend the life of the machine itself and cut down on your energy costs.
Since 1984, we’ve helped homeowners in the Northern Virginia and the greater Washington DC metro area tackle their dryer vent cleaning needs. Our experienced technicians have the tools and the knowledge to clear any size clog.
  
Our experience isn’t limited to only residential dryer vents, we also have extensive experience in commercial and government facilities, including the replacement of fire-rated transitions.
