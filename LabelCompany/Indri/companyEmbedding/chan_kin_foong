System and method for lossless data transmission



Patent number:  7062094
                                            

Abstract:  A method for losslessly transmitting data is provided. The data is separated into two or more portions and the second portion is subtracted from the first portion to find a difference. The first portion and the difference are transmitted, and then the second portion is reconstructed by adding the difference to the first portion. The data may comprise two or more images, with each image being a temporally displaced version of the preceding image. Each image may be divided into multiple areas, where the areas on each image correspond to the areas on the other images. A difference may be obtained by subtracting each area of an image from the corresponding area of the preceding image. The first image may then be transferred as a reference image along with the differences, and each image may be reconstructed by adding each difference to the corresponding area of the previous image.

Microlens array fabrication



Publication number:  20030108821
                                            

Abstract:  A new and unique method for fabricating a microlens array is provided. First, a mask layer is applied to an optical substrate. One or more holes are then created in the mask layer so that corresponding first cavities can then be created in the substrate. Each of these first cavities has a predetermined depth and a first width. The mask layer is then removed so that one or more second cavities can be created in the substrate, the second cavities corresponding with the first cavities. Each of these second cavities has approximately the same predetermined depth as the corresponding first cavity and having a second width greater than the first width.

Non-synchronous control of laser diode



Publication number:  20030084422
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method for non-synchronously projecting light in an imaging system is provided. A pixel panel may be selectively controlled to direct light onto or away from a subject. A light source, such as a laser diode, projects light pulses at the pixel panel. The pulses are not synchronized with the pixel panel, so the light may strike the pixel panel at any time when the pixel panel is operable to direct light towards the subject. The pulses may be constant or variable in energy or duration, depending on the desired results.

Delivery mechanism for a laser diode array



Publication number:  20030043582
                                            

Abstract:  A laser diode array light source includes a plurality of semiconductor diodes attached to a first substrate, with each diode having an aperture for emitting an output of light positioned on a side of the diode, the side being generally perpendicular to the first substrate. A second substrate is positioned adjacent to the first substrate and includes a plurality of reflective surfaces for redirecting each of the outputs of light. In this way, the light from the plurality of diodes can be commonly directed to provide a directional light source.

Surface distortion compensated photolithography



Publication number:  20030025979
                                            

Abstract:  A distortion compensation system for use in an imaging device such as a photolithography system is described. The system projects a plurality of image portions onto a plurality of portions of a subject. The system includes a plurality of light-distance modulators corresponding to the plurality of image portions and a mechanical manipulator for individually manipulating each of the light-distance modulators. In this way, any distortion in the subject is compensated by the individual manipulation of the light-distance modulators.

Light modulation device and system



Patent number:  6512625
                                            

Abstract:  A light modulation element, device, and system is discussed. The light modulation element includes three electrodes, a flexible member, and a mirror. The flexible member is connected between the three electrodes so that the first and second electrodes are on one side and the third electrode is on the opposite side of the flexible member. The mirror is attached to the flexible member so that it can move therewith. The flexible member moves responsive to an external electrostatic force provided by one or more of the three electrodes so that the mirror is positioned in a predetermined position responsive to the state of the flexible member.

Laser irradiation mapping system



Publication number:  20020133144
                                            

Abstract:  A digital micromirror device is used in a semi-automated system to reflect a tailored portion of a laser beam according to image data that defines a mapped target area of an object for selective irradiation by the tailored laser beam. A computer having an interface device, such as a light pen, is used to map the boundary on a computer screen of a target area of an object, which may be the retina of a patient's eye or some other object. A projector cooperates with a laser source, the digital micromirror device and the computer to enable a laser beam to be tailored to correspond to the irregular shape of the intended target area to avoid irradiating portions of the object other than the target area itself. The system is capable of tracking movement of the target area and maintaining the tailored laser beam aligned to irradiate the target area during movement.

High power incoherent light source with laser array



Publication number:  20020126479
                                            

Abstract:  A high power light source is provided. The light source includes one or more diodes that may produce relatively coherent light of a desired intensity. The diodes may be pulsed to provide light as desired. The light projected by the diodes passes through a combiner, which combines the light from the different diodes and passes the combined light to an incoherence apparatus. The incoherence apparatus may include a rotating surface relief phase device such as an optical hologram, a computer generated hologram, or a diffractive optical element with random phase modulation. The incoherence apparatus may include a rotating fiber conduit comprising a plurality of multifiber cores. The incoherence apparatus renders the combined light incoherent and passes it to an illuminator apparatus that focuses the incoherent combined light onto an image plane.

Light modulation device and system



Patent number:  6433917
                                            

Abstract:  A light modulation element, device, and system is discussed. The light modulation element includes three electrodes, a flexible member, and a mirror. The flexible member is connected between the three electrodes so that the first and second electrodes are on one side and the third electrode is on the opposite side of the flexible member. The mirror is attached to the flexible member so that it can move therewith. The flexible member moves responsive to an external electrostatic force provided by one or more of the three electrodes so that the mirror is positioned in a predetermined position responsive to the state of the flexible member.

The New Way to Find People
More than a regular search engine.

It's the quick and easy way to look people up. Do a deep public record
search to uncover the important information you're looking for. Now you'll
never have to search someone on google again.
