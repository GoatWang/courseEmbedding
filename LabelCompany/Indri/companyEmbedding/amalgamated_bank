History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Headquartered in New York City, Amalgamated Bank has 16 branches in four NYC boroughs, Washington D.C., and California.[7] There is also 24-hour access through online and mobile banking. Amalgamated Bank offers comprehensive financial services for individuals, small businesses and commercial clients. Products include: deposits, loans, investments, cash management, residential and commercial mortgages. Checking customers have access to over 40,000 surcharge-free ATMs across the U.S. through the Allpoint Network. Amalgamated Bank specializes in providing loans and banking services to political and advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations, labor unions and Middle Market companies. Some notable clients of the bank include:

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
Democratic National Committee[8]
Democratic Governors Association[9]

League of Conservation Voters
National Coalition of Black Civil Participation
Organizing for Action
Presidential Inauguration Committee
Public Citizen
United We Dream
Service Employees International Union (SEIU)
United Federation of Teachers

Corporate governance[edit]
Amalgamated Bank promotes sustainable, long-term shareholder value by advocating sound environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices at portfolio firms. Amalgamated Bank adheres to and is a signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The bank engages in shareholder actions including, but not limited to regulatory advocacy, proxy voting, and litigation to improve firm performance, safeguard shareholder value and recover shareholder losses. Amalgamated Bank has a long history of shareholder activism:

In the 1990s the bank urged that each Board be composed in majority of independent directors, long before this standard became a regulated requirement
In 1994, the bank fought sweatshop abuses by urging companies to adopt and monitor Codes of Conduct
In 1997, the bank started advocating full public reporting of all corporate political contributions, including “soft money” donations and later trade associations and 501(c)(4) organizations
In 2000, the bank started challenging outsized severance packages by demanding limits to golden parachutes
In 2001, the bank took legal action against Enron for massive accounting fraud, eventually recovering billions of dollars in losses for investors
In 2004, the bank pioneered shareholder resolutions requiring companies to have clawback policies in order to recover ill-gotten executive pay
In 2011, the bank spearheaded an initiative to urge oil companies to integrate environmental and safety performance as a condition for executives to be paid bonuses
In 2013, the bank achieved the largest shareholder derivative settlement in Delaware, alleging failed board oversight in the wake of the hacking scandal at News Corp
In 2014, the bank sponsored a shareholder resolution to limit windfall golden parachutes for executives at Valero Energy Corp. upon a change-in-control of the company, a rare majority vote in support of tightening executive compensation standards
In 2015, Amalgamated announced a $137.5 million settlement of a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders in Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the Arizona-based metals and mining corporation formerly known as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc.
Also in 2015, the bank announced a record-breaking $146.25 million settlement on behalf of shareholders in a lawsuit against Duke Energy Corporation, the largest electric power holding company in the United States.
Also in 2015, Amalgamated announced that five major energy companies agreed to new measures that limit potential golden parachutes for executives in the event of a merger or other change of company control.

Corporate values[edit]
Purchasing policy[edit]
Since its founding in 1923, Amalgamated Bank has been dedicated to supporting American workers and the American Labor Movement. The bank strives to purchase as many products as possible that have been made by union workers in America. In addition, the bank aims to hire union contractors for its building and construction projects and to have its outside printing produced by union printers with the union label displayed. The bank also does its best to fly on unionized airlines and stay at unionized hotels.[11]
Minimum wage[edit]
In 2015, Amalgamated Bank announced that it would become the first bank in the nation to raise all employee wages to a minimum of $15 per hour.[12]
Amalgamated announced the news on the heels of the release of a study [13] by the National Employment Law Project detailing a great discrepancy in wages in the banking industry. According to the study, while full-time bank tellers earn $25,800/year on average, a typical bank CEO makes in the tens of millions of dollars annually after full compensation packages are included. In New York, the study found that the median wage for bank tellers is $13.31 per hour leaving 39% of New York State bank tellers enrolled in public assistance programs.
Amalgamated Bank's CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 17:1.[14]
Commitment to affordable housing[edit]
Throughout its history, Amalgamated Bank has consistently funded the construction and renovation of affordable housing developments. Through its Affordable Housing Construction Loan program,[15] the bank will invest more than $100 million to rehabilitate and build thousands of affordable units in New York.
Accessibility in banking[edit]
In an effort to open up the benefits of the banking system to all people, Amalgamated Bank accepts 12 forms of identification for account opening, including IDNYC, New York City's municipal identification card.
Access to banking in NYC has long been an issue. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that around 1 million adult New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, but instead use fringe financial services like check cashers to pay bills, cash payroll checks, buy money orders and conduct other financial transactions.[16]
IDNYC cards can be obtained by city residents at no cost and can be used at any of Amalgamated Bank’s NYC branches across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. The cards are now an acceptable form of government-issued photo documentation for purposes of verifying the customer’s identity when opening an account under the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[17]

History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Headquartered in New York City, Amalgamated Bank has 16 branches in four NYC boroughs, Washington D.C., and California.[7] There is also 24-hour access through online and mobile banking.

Checking customers have access to over 40,000 surcharge-free ATMs across the U.S. through the Allpoint Network.

Corporate governance[edit]
Amalgamated Bank promotes sustainable, long-term shareholder value by advocating sound environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices at portfolio firms. Amalgamated Bank adheres to and is a signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The bank engages in shareholder actions including, but not limited to regulatory advocacy, proxy voting, and litigation to improve firm performance, safeguard shareholder value and recover shareholder losses. Amalgamated Bank has a long history of shareholder activism:

In the 1990s the bank urged that each Board be composed in majority of independent directors, long before this standard became a regulated requirement
In 1994, the bank fought sweatshop abuses by urging companies to adopt and monitor Codes of Conduct
In 1997, the bank started advocating full public reporting of all corporate political contributions, including “soft money” donations and later trade associations and 501(c)(4) organizations
In 2000, the bank started challenging outsized severance packages by demanding limits to golden parachutes
In 2001, the bank took legal action against Enron for massive accounting fraud, eventually recovering billions of dollars in losses for investors
In 2004, the bank pioneered shareholder resolutions requiring companies to have clawback policies in order to recover ill-gotten executive pay
In 2011, the bank spearheaded an initiative to urge oil companies to integrate environmental and safety performance as a condition for executives to be paid bonuses
In 2013, the bank achieved the largest shareholder derivative settlement in Delaware, alleging failed board oversight in the wake of the hacking scandal at News Corp
In 2014, the bank sponsored a shareholder resolution to limit windfall golden parachutes for executives at Valero Energy Corp. upon a change-in-control of the company, a rare majority vote in support of tightening executive compensation standards
In 2015, Amalgamated announced a $137.5 million settlement of a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders in Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the Arizona-based metals and mining corporation formerly known as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc.
Also in 2015, the bank announced a record-breaking $146.25 million settlement on behalf of shareholders in a lawsuit against Duke Energy Corporation, the largest electric power holding company in the United States.
Also in 2015, Amalgamated announced that five major energy companies agreed to new measures that limit potential golden parachutes for executives in the event of a merger or other change of company control.

Corporate values[edit]
Purchasing policy[edit]
Since its founding in 1923, Amalgamated Bank has been dedicated to supporting American workers and the American Labor Movement. The bank strives to purchase as many products as possible that have been made by union workers in America. In addition, the bank aims to hire union contractors for its building and construction projects and to have its outside printing produced by union printers with the union label displayed. The bank also does its best to fly on unionized airlines and stay at unionized hotels.[11]
Minimum wage[edit]
In 2015, Amalgamated Bank announced that it would become the first bank in the nation to raise all employee wages to a minimum of $15 per hour.[12]
Amalgamated announced the news on the heels of the release of a study [13] by the National Employment Law Project detailing a great discrepancy in wages in the banking industry. According to the study, while full-time bank tellers earn $25,800/year on average, a typical bank CEO makes in the tens of millions of dollars annually after full compensation packages are included. In New York, the study found that the median wage for bank tellers is $13.31 per hour leaving 39% of New York State bank tellers enrolled in public assistance programs.
Amalgamated Bank's CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 17:1.[14]
Commitment to affordable housing[edit]
Throughout its history, Amalgamated Bank has consistently funded the construction and renovation of affordable housing developments. Through its Affordable Housing Construction Loan program,[15] the bank will invest more than $100 million to rehabilitate and build thousands of affordable units in New York.
Accessibility in banking[edit]
In an effort to open up the benefits of the banking system to all people, Amalgamated Bank accepts 12 forms of identification for account opening, including IDNYC, New York City's municipal identification card.
Access to banking in NYC has long been an issue. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that around 1 million adult New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, but instead use fringe financial services like check cashers to pay bills, cash payroll checks, buy money orders and conduct other financial transactions.[16]
IDNYC cards can be obtained by city residents at no cost and can be used at any of Amalgamated Bank’s NYC branches across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. The cards are now an acceptable form of government-issued photo documentation for purposes of verifying the customer’s identity when opening an account under the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[17]

History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]

Corporate governance[edit]
Amalgamated Bank promotes sustainable, long-term shareholder value by advocating sound environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices at portfolio firms. Amalgamated Bank adheres to and is a signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The bank engages in shareholder actions including, but not limited to regulatory advocacy, proxy voting, and litigation to improve firm performance, safeguard shareholder value and recover shareholder losses. Amalgamated Bank has a long history of shareholder activism:

In the 1990s the bank urged that each Board be composed in majority of independent directors, long before this standard became a regulated requirement
In 1994, the bank fought sweatshop abuses by urging companies to adopt and monitor Codes of Conduct
In 1997, the bank started advocating full public reporting of all corporate political contributions, including “soft money” donations and later trade associations and 501(c)(4) organizations
In 2000, the bank started challenging outsized severance packages by demanding limits to golden parachutes
In 2001, the bank took legal action against Enron for massive accounting fraud, eventually recovering billions of dollars in losses for investors
In 2004, the bank pioneered shareholder resolutions requiring companies to have clawback policies in order to recover ill-gotten executive pay
In 2011, the bank spearheaded an initiative to urge oil companies to integrate environmental and safety performance as a condition for executives to be paid bonuses
In 2013, the bank achieved the largest shareholder derivative settlement in Delaware, alleging failed board oversight in the wake of the hacking scandal at News Corp
In 2014, the bank sponsored a shareholder resolution to limit windfall golden parachutes for executives at Valero Energy Corp. upon a change-in-control of the company, a rare majority vote in support of tightening executive compensation standards
In 2015, Amalgamated announced a $137.5 million settlement of a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders in Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the Arizona-based metals and mining corporation formerly known as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc.
Also in 2015, the bank announced a record-breaking $146.25 million settlement on behalf of shareholders in a lawsuit against Duke Energy Corporation, the largest electric power holding company in the United States.
Also in 2015, Amalgamated announced that five major energy companies agreed to new measures that limit potential golden parachutes for executives in the event of a merger or other change of company control.

Corporate values[edit]
Purchasing policy[edit]
Since its founding in 1923, Amalgamated Bank has been dedicated to supporting American workers and the American Labor Movement. The bank strives to purchase as many products as possible that have been made by union workers in America. In addition, the bank aims to hire union contractors for its building and construction projects and to have its outside printing produced by union printers with the union label displayed. The bank also does its best to fly on unionized airlines and stay at unionized hotels.[11]
Minimum wage[edit]
In 2015, Amalgamated Bank announced that it would become the first bank in the nation to raise all employee wages to a minimum of $15 per hour.[12]
Amalgamated announced the news on the heels of the release of a study [13] by the National Employment Law Project detailing a great discrepancy in wages in the banking industry. According to the study, while full-time bank tellers earn $25,800/year on average, a typical bank CEO makes in the tens of millions of dollars annually after full compensation packages are included. In New York, the study found that the median wage for bank tellers is $13.31 per hour leaving 39% of New York State bank tellers enrolled in public assistance programs.
Amalgamated Bank's CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 17:1.[14]
Commitment to affordable housing[edit]
Throughout its history, Amalgamated Bank has consistently funded the construction and renovation of affordable housing developments. Through its Affordable Housing Construction Loan program,[15] the bank will invest more than $100 million to rehabilitate and build thousands of affordable units in New York.
Accessibility in banking[edit]
In an effort to open up the benefits of the banking system to all people, Amalgamated Bank accepts 12 forms of identification for account opening, including IDNYC, New York City's municipal identification card.
Access to banking in NYC has long been an issue. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that around 1 million adult New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, but instead use fringe financial services like check cashers to pay bills, cash payroll checks, buy money orders and conduct other financial transactions.[16]
IDNYC cards can be obtained by city residents at no cost and can be used at any of Amalgamated Bank’s NYC branches across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. The cards are now an acceptable form of government-issued photo documentation for purposes of verifying the customer’s identity when opening an account under the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[17]

About Amalgamated Bank
Amalgamated Bank has always been a different kind of bank. Founded in 1923 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, a textile union of mostly immigrants in New York City, Amalgamated Bank became the first financial institution for the working class in a time when banking solely benefited corporations and the wealthy. Amalgamated pioneered free savings accounts, free checking accounts, unsecured credit, affordable housing loans, and second chance bank accounts for those people who had credit problems in the past. 
Since then, the bank has grown to serve those who help make the world more just, compassionate and sustainable. Their extensive experience, financial resources and community of like-minded customers offers labor unions, philanthropies, political campaigns, socially and environmentally responsible corporations, as well as individuals, a unique set of financial services enabling them to lead the charge to improve our communities and our country. It’s this commitment to working people and the organizations that support them that continues to set them apart from other banks.
B Corp certification provided us with a unique opportunity to join a community of like-minded organizations who hold themselves to a higher standard of good governance and corporate transparency. Much of what we do is guided by the desire to be the bank of the progressive community and by being held to the B Corps standard, we’re putting our money where our mouth is. Inherent in our mission is the goal of building a more equitable global culture in which corporations seek to benefit every person.
The Change We Seek®
Amalgamated Bank wants to open the world to mission based banking. Where you put your money matters and if you value the environment, a fair minimum wage, human rights and corporate governance, your bank should share those values. Too often, consumers choose their banks based on convenience of location, infinitesimal differences in interest rates and fees. As the banking landscape continues to change, it’s time to instead base those decisions off what really matters. 
Providing sound banking services and banking on values need not be mutually exclusive ideologies. Through the creation of innovative products and services they have the ability to help grow their clients capital and business while making the world a better place to live. 
How is your money helping build a better world?

Amalgamated's proprietary titanium technology makes titanium consumer, military, and industrial products more affordable than ever before.











ABOUT AMALGAMATED




We are a specialty metals company based in Cambridge, MA that developed a cost-reducing titanium technology. Our proprietary technology allows our firm to manufacture titanium products cost-effectively. We can produce goods and sell them at a relative equivalent price to inferior material substitutes, such as high-grade steels and aluminums. Our company designs, manufactures, sells, and also licenses the highest quality titanium products at affordable prices. We design and create products for ourselves and for companies who will benefit from titanium's exceptional and unique attributes. We also stand by our titanium products with a lifetime guarantee.








SEPTEMBER 2016
Amalgamated at Quantico, VA
We were one of only 22 companies in the world to be invited by the Marine Corps to their annual Marksmanship Technology Demonstration (MTD). Held in September 2016, this three day event allowed the Marines, FBI, DEA, and Police officers to review and test Amalgamated arms. After a successful showing, Amalgamated Titanium was asked to sponsor the upcoming 3 Gun Competition in October, also to be held at the base in Quantico.

When coupled with our proprietary technology, titanium now becomes affordable for even mass produced items.

History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]

Corporate governance[edit]
Amalgamated Bank promotes sustainable, long-term shareholder value by advocating sound environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices at portfolio firms. Amalgamated Bank adheres to and is a signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The bank engages in shareholder actions including, but not limited to regulatory advocacy, proxy voting, and litigation to improve firm performance, safeguard shareholder value and recover shareholder losses. Amalgamated Bank has a long history of shareholder activism:

In the 1990s the bank urged that each Board be composed in majority of independent directors, long before this standard became a regulated requirement
In 1994, the bank fought sweatshop abuses by urging companies to adopt and monitor Codes of Conduct
In 1997, the bank started advocating full public reporting of all corporate political contributions, including “soft money” donations and later trade associations and 501(c)(4) organizations
In 2000, the bank started challenging outsized severance packages by demanding limits to golden parachutes
In 2001, the bank took legal action against Enron for massive accounting fraud, eventually recovering billions of dollars in losses for investors
In 2004, the bank pioneered shareholder resolutions requiring companies to have clawback policies in order to recover ill-gotten executive pay
In 2011, the bank spearheaded an initiative to urge oil companies to integrate environmental and safety performance as a condition for executives to be paid bonuses
In 2013, the bank achieved the largest shareholder derivative settlement in Delaware, alleging failed board oversight in the wake of the hacking scandal at News Corp
In 2014, the bank sponsored a shareholder resolution to limit windfall golden parachutes for executives at Valero Energy Corp. upon a change-in-control of the company, a rare majority vote in support of tightening executive compensation standards
In 2015, Amalgamated announced a $137.5 million settlement of a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders in Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the Arizona-based metals and mining corporation formerly known as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc.
Also in 2015, the bank announced a record-breaking $146.25 million settlement on behalf of shareholders in a lawsuit against Duke Energy Corporation, the largest electric power holding company in the United States.
Also in 2015, Amalgamated announced that five major energy companies agreed to new measures that limit potential golden parachutes for executives in the event of a merger or other change of company control.

Corporate values[edit]
Purchasing policy[edit]
Since its founding in 1923, Amalgamated Bank has been dedicated to supporting American workers and the American Labor Movement. The bank strives to purchase as many products as possible that have been made by union workers in America. In addition, the bank aims to hire union contractors for its building and construction projects and to have its outside printing produced by union printers with the union label displayed. The bank also does its best to fly on unionized airlines and stay at unionized hotels.[11]
Minimum wage[edit]
In 2015, Amalgamated Bank announced that it would become the first bank in the nation to raise all employee wages to a minimum of $15 per hour.[12]
Amalgamated announced the news on the heels of the release of a study [13] by the National Employment Law Project detailing a great discrepancy in wages in the banking industry. According to the study, while full-time bank tellers earn $25,800/year on average, a typical bank CEO makes in the tens of millions of dollars annually after full compensation packages are included. In New York, the study found that the median wage for bank tellers is $13.31 per hour leaving 39% of New York State bank tellers enrolled in public assistance programs.
Amalgamated Bank's CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 17:1.[14]
Commitment to affordable housing[edit]
Throughout its history, Amalgamated Bank has consistently funded the construction and renovation of affordable housing developments. Through its Affordable Housing Construction Loan program,[15] the bank will invest more than $100 million to rehabilitate and build thousands of affordable units in New York.
Accessibility in banking[edit]
In an effort to open up the benefits of the banking system to all people, Amalgamated Bank accepts 12 forms of identification for account opening, including IDNYC, New York City's municipal identification card.
Access to banking in NYC has long been an issue. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that around 1 million adult New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, but instead use fringe financial services like check cashers to pay bills, cash payroll checks, buy money orders and conduct other financial transactions.[16]
IDNYC cards can be obtained by city residents at no cost and can be used at any of Amalgamated Bank’s NYC branches across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. The cards are now an acceptable form of government-issued photo documentation for purposes of verifying the customer’s identity when opening an account under the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[17]

History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]

History[edit]
In 1927, Amalgamated Bank financed the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative, the first union-supported housing development in the United States, which is located in The Bronx. In 1957, it financed the construction of Park Reservoir Housing Cooperative in the Bronx, which was the first affordable housing development created under New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.[5] Amalgamated has a long history of helping union movements. It once opened its bank vaults on a Saturday in order to provide $300,000 in bail for striking workers. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) received $800,000 to post a cash bond within 24 hours. In 1973, bank employees worked all weekend to keep striking Philadelphia teachers out of jail. In 1982, Amalgamated made a $200,000 loan to the striking National Football League Players Association despite the fact that they did not even have an account at the bank.[6]
Products and services[edit]
Headquartered in New York City, Amalgamated Bank has 16 branches in four NYC boroughs, Washington D.C., and California.[7] There is also 24-hour access through online and mobile banking. Amalgamated Bank offers comprehensive financial services for individuals, small businesses and commercial clients. Products include: deposits, loans, investments, cash management, residential and commercial mortgages. Checking customers have access to over 40,000 surcharge-free ATMs across the U.S. through the Allpoint Network. Amalgamated Bank specializes in providing loans and banking services to political and advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations, labor unions and Middle Market companies. Some notable clients of the bank include:

American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
Democratic National Committee[8]
Democratic Governors Association[9]
Demos
DC Employment Justice Center
Economic Policy Institute
International Association of Firefighters[10]
League of Conservation Voters
National Coalition of Black Civil Participation
Organizing for Action
Presidential Inauguration Committee
Public Citizen
United We Dream
Service Employees International Union (SEIU)
United Federation of Teachers

Corporate governance[edit]
Amalgamated Bank promotes sustainable, long-term shareholder value by advocating sound environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices at portfolio firms. Amalgamated Bank adheres to and is a signatory of the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment. The bank engages in shareholder actions including, but not limited to regulatory advocacy, proxy voting, and litigation to improve firm performance, safeguard shareholder value and recover shareholder losses. Amalgamated Bank has a long history of shareholder activism:

In the 1990s the bank urged that each Board be composed in majority of independent directors, long before this standard became a regulated requirement
In 1994, the bank fought sweatshop abuses by urging companies to adopt and monitor Codes of Conduct
In 1997, the bank started advocating full public reporting of all corporate political contributions, including “soft money” donations and later trade associations and 501(c)(4) organizations
In 2000, the bank started challenging outsized severance packages by demanding limits to golden parachutes
In 2001, the bank took legal action against Enron for massive accounting fraud, eventually recovering billions of dollars in losses for investors
In 2004, the bank pioneered shareholder resolutions requiring companies to have clawback policies in order to recover ill-gotten executive pay
In 2011, the bank spearheaded an initiative to urge oil companies to integrate environmental and safety performance as a condition for executives to be paid bonuses
In 2013, the bank achieved the largest shareholder derivative settlement in Delaware, alleging failed board oversight in the wake of the hacking scandal at News Corp
In 2014, the bank sponsored a shareholder resolution to limit windfall golden parachutes for executives at Valero Energy Corp. upon a change-in-control of the company, a rare majority vote in support of tightening executive compensation standards
In 2015, Amalgamated announced a $137.5 million settlement of a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders in Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the Arizona-based metals and mining corporation formerly known as Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc.
Also in 2015, the bank announced a record-breaking $146.25 million settlement on behalf of shareholders in a lawsuit against Duke Energy Corporation, the largest electric power holding company in the United States.
Also in 2015, Amalgamated announced that five major energy companies agreed to new measures that limit potential golden parachutes for executives in the event of a merger or other change of company control.

Corporate values[edit]
Purchasing policy[edit]
Since its founding in 1923, Amalgamated Bank has been dedicated to supporting American workers and the American Labor Movement. The bank strives to purchase as many products as possible that have been made by union workers in America. In addition, the bank aims to hire union contractors for its building and construction projects and to have its outside printing produced by union printers with the union label displayed. The bank also does its best to fly on unionized airlines and stay at unionized hotels.[11]
Minimum wage[edit]
In 2015, Amalgamated Bank announced that it would become the first bank in the nation to raise all employee wages to a minimum of $15 per hour.[12]
Amalgamated announced the news on the heels of the release of a study [13] by the National Employment Law Project detailing a great discrepancy in wages in the banking industry. According to the study, while full-time bank tellers earn $25,800/year on average, a typical bank CEO makes in the tens of millions of dollars annually after full compensation packages are included. In New York, the study found that the median wage for bank tellers is $13.31 per hour leaving 39% of New York State bank tellers enrolled in public assistance programs.
Amalgamated Bank's CEO-to-worker pay ratio is 17:1.[14]
Commitment to affordable housing[edit]
Throughout its history, Amalgamated Bank has consistently funded the construction and renovation of affordable housing developments. Through its Affordable Housing Construction Loan program,[15] the bank will invest more than $100 million to rehabilitate and build thousands of affordable units in New York.
Accessibility in banking[edit]
In an effort to open up the benefits of the banking system to all people, Amalgamated Bank accepts 12 forms of identification for account opening, including IDNYC, New York City's municipal identification card.
Access to banking in NYC has long been an issue. The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs estimates that around 1 million adult New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, but instead use fringe financial services like check cashers to pay bills, cash payroll checks, buy money orders and conduct other financial transactions.[16]
IDNYC cards can be obtained by city residents at no cost and can be used at any of Amalgamated Bank’s NYC branches across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. The cards are now an acceptable form of government-issued photo documentation for purposes of verifying the customer’s identity when opening an account under the Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[17]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
