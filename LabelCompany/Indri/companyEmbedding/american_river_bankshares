Operator
Welcome to the Q2 ‘17 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ely and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I would now turn the call over to David Taber. David, you may begin.
David Taber
Ely, thank you so much and good afternoon everyone. I am David Taber; I am the CEO of American River Bankshares, which is the parent company of American River Bank, which is headquartered in the Greater Sacramento Area.
We are pleased to share company results for the second quarter of 2017. The key to success for American River Bankshares is profitable growth on both sides of the balance sheet driving an increase in net interest income. We must do this, while also managing overhead.
Deposits are up year-over-year, but down on a linked quarter basis. Total loans outstanding are up year-over-year, and up on a linked quarter basis. Please be aware that the two press releases went out at the market opening this morning, the first the financial results for the second quarter and the second what is our quarterly cash and dividend.
Now Mitch Derenzo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial results. Mitch?
Mitch Derenzo
Thank you David, and thanks to all of you for listening in our call today. Before we get started, I need to remind everyone of our Safe Harbor Disclosures. Certain matters discussed in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the federal securities laws and may involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results in these forward-looking statements.
Factors that might cause such a difference are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in subsequent reports filed on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. The company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, which would include information or future events, except as required by law. The links to the Annual Report and our 2016 Form 10-K can be found on our website, americanriverbank.com.
As with past conferences calls, I'm going to highlight some of the key areas from the press release that was issued this morning and then try to provide some additional details and analysis and then turn it back over to David for some additional comments and then we'll open up the lines of questions.
This morning American River Bankshares reported net income for the second quarter 2016 of $1.3 million. That compares with similar $1.3 million that we recorded in the second quarter of last year. Earnings per share were $0.20 per share in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.19 in the second quarter of last year. Trailing 12 months EPS is $0.94 cents per share.
Return on average assets and return on equity for the quarter were 80 basis points and 6.35% respectively. That compares to 84 basis points and a 6.29% respectively one year ago.
On a year-to-date basis, net income was $2.5 million in 2017, compared to $2.7 million in 2016 and the earnings per share were $0.38 in 2017, compared to $0.39 in 2016. The ROA and ROE for the 6 months period was 77 basis points and 6.05% in 2017 respectively compared to 85 basis points and 6.37% respectively one year ago.

Some comments on the asset side of the balance sheet. As David mentioned that net loans did increase. There were up $2.2 million during the second quarter and net loans have increased $11.1 million over the past 12 months.
For the quarter, the second quarter we did add $7.7 million in new loan commitments and the average rate on those new loan commitments added were 4.38% and the average rate on the renewed loans during the quarter was 5.33%. Prepayment fees on the loans during the second quarter were $19,000 that compares to $34,000 during second quarter of last year.
For the quarter we have recoveries of $48,000 in the second quarter of this year, compared to $50,000 in the second quarter of last year. And there were no loan charge-offs in either course. The allowance to loans 1.52 at June 30, ’17, compared to 1.65% one year ago.
A couple other comments in the asset quality area. We did have one not-accrual loan with a balance of $12,000 and there were no loans passed to 30 days or longer. Classified equity ratio at June 30, 2017 was 6.5%, basically to classified assets being the $12,000 non-accrual loan and $1.348 million in OREO for a combined total $1.360. Of course, no change in the order or balance. We continue to hold the two properties that we held at year end. However, both are now in contract for potential sale.
On the investment portfolio, again no significant changes here, continued to be comprised of primarily well-structured cash flow and mortgage products and some high credit quality muni bonds.
The portfolio of total $257.9 million compared to $254.5 million at December 31st, still remains about 89% is U.S. Government agencies or US Government-sponsored agencies, primarily mortgage related products.
The portfolio remains relatively short. The average life of the mortgage products about 3.6 years and the average life for the muni portfolio is 5.2 years. The effective duration of the entire portfolio remains quite low at about 2.8 years and the price change in rates at 300 is 9.4% percent.
The unrealized gain on the available for sale bond portfolio increased from $916,000 at December 31 2016 million and $1.321 at March 31 2017 to $1.647 at June 30 2017.
Look at the liability side. If you recall last quarter I did report when I was talking about the first quarter results that the first quarter does tend to be difficult on the deposit balances, as business owners tend to move money out, they have paid bonuses, take out new draws, paid some taxes. However I notice that deposit balance did increase from $544.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $551 at March 31.
If you recall I did express some concern that the IRS decision to delay the date for business owners to pay the prior year final tax liability that it moved up from March 15 to April 18 that increased deposit balances during the first quarter maybe temporary and my concerns were valid as we did experience a $13.1 million decrease in deposits during the second quarter. However, overall deposits for some site - the overall deposits are now down $6.9 million for the year, but up $11.9 million from one year ago.
But non-interest bearing balance they continue to remain at 36% of the deposit totals and then the non-CD balances which we tend to classify as core deposits those remains 85$ of total deposits.
The average cost of funds did increase 2 basis points from 26 basis points in the second quarter last year to 28 basis points in the second quarter this year. The reason for that increased results from the higher rates pay on FHLB borrowings and higher CD cost.
The increase in the short term market interest rates has not had much impact on our core deposit base, as those rates remain stable. The deposit costs on checking and savings accounts, including money markets are basically the same as they were in the same quarter last year. Well, actually they decreased small amount, they were 6.5 basis points in the second quarter last year versus 6.2 basis points in the second quarter of this year.

An increase in the CD and FHLB borrowing expense that results from the renewals rolling over at slightly higher rates. Our overall cost deposits for the second quarter was 15 basis points, that's up from 14 basis points in the second quarter of last year with that slight increase due to the increase in the CD expense.
Our capital, capital levels remain strong, although they decreased slightly during the quarter due to the share repurchases and the quarterly cash dividend. The company has a leverage ratio of 10.2% and total risk based capital of 19.7, now those are down from 10.5 and 20.3 respectively at December 31 2016.
During the second quarter we did repurchase 202,086 shares of our common stock and the average price we paid on those was $14.97 per share. Then of course in May we did pay the $0.05 per share of cash dividend.
For the year, we repurchased 333,086 shares of our common stock, that represents 5% of the outstanding shares and the average price we paid was $14.99. The tangible book value per share that they did increase from $10.14 cents a share at December 31 to $10.23 at June 30, 2017.
Some really - some brief comments on the income statement, the income – non-interest income and non-interest income expenses really not – nothing really material or unusual or non-recurring, but just a couple of brief comments. The non-interest income did increase $76,000 from $363,000 in the second quarter last year to $439,000 in the second quarter this year, really the big increase there is gain on sale securities. We had net gains on sale the second quarter this year of $86,000 and last year we had a impairment loss of $1000.
On the expense side. The expenses did decrease $47,000 from $3.42 million in the second quarter last year to $3.37 million in the second quarter this year. That decrease has set quite a few areas, quite a few line items and we’re really working hard to control the overall expenses and not waste money.
Salaries and benefits are down to tad. We do have a few physicians. Occupancy and furniture, equipment are down as we continue to try to reduce the size of our branches. Less traffic means, less branches – less need for large branches.
On a six month basis the expenses decreased from $7.2 million last year to $6.8 million this year. Again many areas change from last year included in the salaries and benefits and occupancy. But the largest impact would be the decrease in the OREO expense. The OREO expense decreased from 360,000 last year to just 32,000 this year and the majority of the expense last year was related to an impairment charge and one of the properties that we eventually sold in 2016.
We continue to benefit from the FDIC's, the bank insurance funds - the reserve ratio actually reached at 1.15 level, so that resulting in lower and lower assessments for community banks.
That's it. Thank you. And I'll turn it back over to David for some additional comments.
David Taber
Mitch, thanks so much for that comprehensive report. American River Bank is a focused business banks serving Northern California. The company continues to focus on profitable growth of being mindful of our overhead, in addition to being diligent with asset quality.
Our press release included some economic data. In general, I’d encourage you to look through it. But in general positive trends continue in our primary markets in California and certainly in the nation as a whole.
We did achieve a 12% loan growth for last year in 2016 and funded $12.5 million worth of loans in Q2. That resulted in positive growth for the quarter. We talked about fall out in the past. We described that as loans that we didn't make, that had been in our pipeline or our top potential opportunity list and that fall out actually was down from the previous quarter and it's about $31.5 million.

The most prevalent reason for that was that we declined them for not meeting our credit standards and the next most prevalent was borrowers that were desirous of more liberal underwriting standards and probably the biggest one was someone that wanted to maximize the leverage further than we were willing to go. It certainly continues to be very competitive. We're actually seeing more out of area banks, meaning more aggressive in going after those deals and people.
Mitch mentioned after an atypical increase in deposits in Q1, Q2 showed a drop in overall core deposits. Although the team continues to source and new business to the bank was about $4.6 million for the quarter and new business, new relationships.
The vast majority of our deposits are business relationships, providing key evidence of our business focus. Checking accounts make up 48% of total deposits and CDs are just 15%.
I am going to close now and know that we do have considerable work to be done to do in order to increase our net interest income. This will come from profitable growth in both sides of the balance sheet. In addition, we are continually mindful of our overhead and we did complete our 2017 share repurchase plan in Q2 as Mitch mentioned.
And now Ely, we want to open and ask her to open the line for questions and as a reminder please refer as to Mr. Derenzo to our disclosure on forward-looking statements. Our company does not provide guidance and we don't plan to change that practice anytime soon. Contact anyone of the analyst that currently cover our company for a more additional information. Ely, could you open the lines for questions please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Of course. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Don Worthington from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Don Worthington
Good afternoon.
David Taber
Hey, Don.
Mitch Derenzo
Hi, Don.
Don Worthington
In terms of loan growth, I know in the past you have purchased loans is that something you'd consider doing it again…
David Taber
We're continually looking at opportunities and that's based on – we just didn’t see anything that we were able to come to terms on in Q2.
Don Worthington
Okay. And then you mentioned fundings for $12.5 million. What were the pay-offs in the quarter?
David Taber
[indiscernible] forward and change…
Don Worthington
I didn’t…
David Taber
Excuse me, I am sorry, pay-offs and pay downs were $10 million.
Don Worthington
Okay. All right. Great. And then…
David Taber
Just for clarification, Mitch has reported and talked about commitments of 7…
Mitch Derenzo
7.7
David Taber
$7.7 million I know to funding with fairly couple large construction draws, included in my fundings as well as a guidance line that the bar will finally tip down an additional $3 million to finalize our commitment to have.
Don Worthington
Okay. Great. And then in terms, I think you alluded to it, but are you experiencing pressure on the deposit side in terms of rates from the competition, you know, after that the Fed rate increases?
Mitch Derenzo
Don, let me jump in there. No, you know, as I kind of pointed out, our actual cost is actually down a tad in terms of a year ago on our core type deposits. The only increase in expenses is on the CDs and we have 15% in CDs and some of those are just short term CDs that are rolling at a slightly higher rate. We have moved our CD rates up a little bit, but not significant.
So our core deposits, we are having a lot of pressure. We haven't had - it doesn't appear that any of our competitors are raising their rates either. So we’re kind of banking on that right now. There's still - we believe there's a lot of liquidity in the system. So we don't anticipate much pressure on the deposit rates in the short term. But we are prepared for it if it does occur.

Don Worthington
Okay. All right, thanks.
David Taber
All right, Don.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim O'Brien from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.
Tim O'Brien
Hi, Dave. Hi, Mitch.
Mitch Derenzo
Hey, Tim.
David Taber
Hi, Tim.
Tim O'Brien
Little color on fee income. Just looking at service charges and they are down, they steadily decline, for now, you know pretty good string of quarters. Can you give a little color on what's happening there and whether or not that's something that you anticipate you can do something about to stabilize those. So you can shore up that line item of fee income?
Mitch Derenzo
Yes, Tim the biggest decrease in that line item really is the NSF charges. We’re not collecting as many NSF charges because we're not having as many clients bounced checks, you know I think that's probably a statement on the economy that things are getting better for everybody else and they’re fun.
So you know, we do a real good analysis of our service charges. We bump with the competitors. We tend to have a lot of high balance accounts which a lot of these – when you’ve got seven figures in the account its tough to charge a service charge, most of them enough compensating balances to have these service charges waived. So I don't think that that's going to be an area of growth for us any time soon.
Tim O'Brien
And then your - the line item, the other non-interest expense line item was up you know, a little bit here sequentially from the first quarter. Can you give a little color on what's behind that increase Mitch and is that…
Mitch Derenzo
When I was doing my analysis, I was trying to go through that, there was a lot of little small items in there. There was some increase in business development, some advertising increases, some increases and some - of operation losses, but no real - nothing really jumped out at me on that one.
Tim O'Brien
Is that going to – I mean, is that 8:31 number is higher than it's been in several quarters. Is that an anomaly or is it going to settle back below 8 do you think or is that kind of the new norm. You know, just that you guys are investing a little bit in those things and we'll continue to do that and we'll see a little higher run rate there?
Mitch Derenzo
Yeah, it maybe a little higher than it was previous quarters. The run rate might be a little higher than previous quarters. So yes, this might have been an anomaly, how much of it. I'm not quite sure of it, somewhere between where we were last quarter and this quarter was probably the – that’s a pretty clear number.
Tim O'Brien
And then if you gave them I missed it, but did you give end of quarter headcount numbers FTE headcount number to us?
Mitch Derenzo
I did not. I think we're roughly 93 or 94 somewhere in that range FTE. So that’s not a significant change from last quarter.
Tim O'Brien
Any plans to fill those openings, you know, before summer ends, before winter comes?
David Taber
We are working hard on that Tim.
Tim O'Brien
Good deal. Thanks for answering my questions, guys.
David Taber
You bet.
Operator
Thank you. We do have no further questions at this time.
David Taber
I am sorry, did you say no questions?
Operator
Yes, we have no further questions.
David Taber
All right, great. Well, thanks for everybody for participating. Mitch, thanks so much for giving you a report and we look forward to continue to work hard to build our company for our shareholders and on our team. Have a great afternoon.
Mitch Derenzo
Thank you.

 Northern California Economic Update, June 30, 2017. Each quarter, management at American River Bank prepares an economic report for internal use that analyzes the recent historical rolling quarters within the three primary markets in which the Company does business – the Greater Sacramento Area, Sonoma and Amador Counties.  Sources of economic and industry information include: Colliers International, Keegan & Coppin Company, Inc., YCharts Housing, State of California Employment Development Department, US Census, CBRE, Integra Realty Resources, and Sacramento Association of Realtors and Trading Economics. Overall, 2016 commercial real estate and employment trends were positive and have continued into 2017.  Commercial Real Estate.  In the Greater Sacramento Area, when comparing first quarter 2017 to first quarter 2016, commercial real estate vacancies have improved in all segments.  Office vacancy decreased from 13.0% to 11.4%, retail vacancy decreased from 10.2% to 9.6%, and industrial vacancy decreased from 9.8% to 7.5%.  In Sonoma County, for the same period (first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016), commercial real estate vacancies also improved.  Office vacancy decreased from 15.6% to 13.8%, retail vacancy decreased from 3.8% to 3.6%, and industrial vacancy from 5.6% to 5.0%.  In all segments (office, retail, and industrial), the Greater Sacramento Area reported positive absorption over the past three years, with the exception of first quarter 2016.  Sonoma County has reported (when data is available) positive absorption over the past three years for the office and industrial segments (retail data not available). In the Greater Sacramento Area, commercial lease rates have been in a relatively narrow range over the past two years through the first quarter 2017 with lease rates ranging from the following: office: $1.71/SF to $1.78/SF; retail: $1.33/SF to $1.40/SF and industrial: $0.43/SF to $0.47/SF.  At March 31, 2017, lease rates per square foot were $1.72 for office, $1.35 for retail, and $0.47 for industrial.   As a proxy for Sonoma County, the City of Santa Rosa’s gross lease rates from first quarter 2014 through the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 showed some fluctuation in office and industrial segments and a decrease in the retail segment.  The lease rates during the two year period ranged from: office: $1.47/SF to $1.88/SF, retail: $0.90/SF to $1.52/SF, and industrial: $0.66/SF to $0.95/SF.  Year-end 2016 office rents ranged from $1.75/SF to $2.25/SF depending on quality. Industrial rents ranged from $0.85/SF to $0.95/SF with light industrial in certain cases ranging from $1.15/SF to $1.40/SF.  There was no retail rental rate data available for Santa Rosa for this time period.   Lease rate data for office and industrial becomes available after each year end.   The Amador region has the lowest level of commercial real estate concentration in the Bank.  There is limited supply for commercial real estate in this region and as a result, minimal information is available. Multi-family.  The multi-family market in the Greater Sacramento Area has reflected high occupancy over the last five quarters (Q116 through Q117), ranging from 97.2% to 97.9%.  As of first quarter 2017, the occupancy rate was 97.2%.  Monthly lease rates during this period ranged from $1,157 to $1,249.  As of first quarter 2017, the average was $1,249 per month which according to Colliers International, is a new record for the region.  The trailing 12-month cap rate during the five quarters ranged from 5.58% to 5.90%.  As of first quarter 2017, the rate was 5.70%.  The average price per unit increased from $101,552 in first quarter 2016 to $114,828 in first quarter 2017 attributing to the slight decline in cap rate.  Similar data for the Sonoma and Amador markets is currently unavailable.  Employment.  National unemployment, which reached a high of 10.0% at October 31, 2009, has dropped steadily since and has stabilized.  Compared to December 2014, national unemployment decreased from 5.6% to 5.0% in December 2015, and to 4.7% as of December 2016.  As of May 2017, unemployment dropped slightly further to 4.3%, then ticked up to 4.4% at June 30, 2017. California unemployment was 6.9% at December 31 2014, 5.9% at December 31, 2015, and 5.2% at December 31, 2016.  As of May 2017, the rate decreased further to 4.7%.  The number of employed Californians continues to increase.  There were 17.5 million employed at the end of 2014, 17.9 million employed at the end of 2015, and 18.2 million at the end of 2016.  The State added another 93,000 jobs during the first seven months of 2017.  At December 31, 2014, all three of our markets reported lower unemployment rates than at year end 2013.  This trend continued at a slower pace into 2015, and at December 31, 2015, unemployment rates were 5.5% and 4.2% for the Sacramento MSA and Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA, respectively.  Compared to December 31, 2016, unemployment rates decreased as of month-end May 2017 from 4.8% to 4.1% in the Sacramento MSA and 3.6% to 3.0% in the Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA.  Over the same period, Amador County has been higher than the State every quarter with the exception of the third quarter 2015.  Amador County had shown significant improvement from 7.4% at December 31, 2014 to 6.3% at December 31, 2015, and 5.7% at December 31, 2016.  As of month-end May 2017, the rate decreased to 4.4%. Job growth was positive in all of our markets in the past two years.  Compared to December 2014, job growth was 1.71%, 2.13% and 0.61% for the Sacramento MSA, Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA, and Amador County, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  Comparing December 2015 to December 2016, job growth was 1.95%, 0.36% and 4.31% for the Sacramento MSA, Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA and Amador County, respectively.  As of month-end May 2017, the Sacramento and Santa Rosa-Petaluma MSA’s job growth was flat compared to December 2016, whereas Amador County’s increased by 2.32%.  Balance Sheet Review American River Bankshares’ assets totaled $641.6 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $651.5 million at December 31, 2016, and $625.8 million at June 30, 2016. Net loans totaled $316.1 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $324.1 million at December 31, 2016, and $305.1 million at June 30, 2016.  The loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 included: real estate loans of $288.7 million (90% of the portfolio), commercial loans of $28.8 million (9% of the portfolio) and other loans, which consist mainly of agriculture and consumer loans of $3.8 million (1% of the portfolio).  The real estate loan portfolio at June 30, 2017 includes: owner-occupied commercial real estate loans of $69.8 million (24% of the real estate portfolio), investor commercial real estate loans of $120.5 million (42% of the real estate portfolio), multi-family real estate loans of $71.0 million (25% of the real estate portfolio), construction and land development loans of $9.9 million (3% of the real estate portfolio) and residential real estate loans of $17.5 million (6% of the real estate loan portfolio). Nonperforming assets (“NPAs”) include nonperforming loans, leases, and other assets and other real estate owned.  Nonperforming loans include all such loans and leases that are either placed on nonaccrual status or are 90 days past due as to principal or interest, but still accrue interest because such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection.  NPAs remained at $1.4 million at June 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 and decreased from $2.8 million at June 30, 2016.  The NPAs to total assets ratio remained consistent at 0.21% at the end of June 2017 and December 31, 2016 and decreased from 0.45% one year ago.  Nonperforming loans decreased $1.0 million (97.9%) from $1.1 million at June 30, 2016 to $12,000 at June 30, 2017, consistent with the $19,000 balance at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had two OREO properties totaling $1.3 million. This compares to two OREO properties totaling $896,000 at June 30, 2016.  During the second quarter of 2017, the Company did not add, sell, or modify the value of any OREO properties.  At June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016 there was not a valuation allowance for OREO properties.  Loans measured for impairment were $17.0 million at the end of June 2017, a decrease from $17.3 million at December 31, 2016, and $20.8 million a year ago.  Specific reserves of $505,000 were held on the impaired loans at June 30, 2017, compared to $421,000 at December 31, 2016 and $904,000 at June 30, 2016.  There was no provision for loan and lease losses for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016.  The Company had net recoveries of $48,000 in the second quarter of 2017 compared to net recoveries of $50,000 in the second quarter of 2016.  For the first six months of 2017, the Company had net recoveries of $59,000 compared to net recoveries of $157,000 in the first six months of 2016.  The Company maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. The methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date.  Investment securities, which excludes $3.9 million in stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB Stock”), totaled $257.9 million at June 30, 2017, up 1.3% from $254.5 million at December 31, 2016 and up 1.1% from $255.0 million at June 30, 2016.  At June 30, 2017, the investment portfolio was comprised of 89% U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies (primarily mortgage-backed securities), 9% obligations of states and political subdivisions, and 2% corporate bonds. At June 30, 2017, total deposits were $537.9 million, compared to $544.8 million at December 31, 2016 and $525.9 million one year ago.  Core deposits increased 3.1% to $457.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $443.3 million at June 30, 2016 and decreased 1.0% from $461.8 million at December 31, 2016.  The Company considers all deposits except time deposits as core deposits. At June 30, 2017, noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 36% of total deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts were 12%, savings deposits were 12%, money market balances accounted for 25% and time certificates were 15% of total deposits.  At June 30, 2016, noninterest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 37% of total deposits, interest-bearing demand accounts were 12%, savings deposits were 11%, money market balances accounted for 24% and time certificates were 16% of total deposits. Shareholders’ equity decreased $2.5 million (3.0%) to $81.4 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $83.9 million at December 31, 2016 and $2.2 million (2.6%) from $83.6 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in equity from December 31, 2016 was due to a decrease in common stock of $4.7 million primarily related to repurchases made under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, partially offset by an increase in Retained Earnings of $1.8 million due to the net income for the year less cash dividends declared and a $444,000 increase in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an increase in the unrealized gain on securities.  Net Interest Income  The net interest income during the second quarter of 2017 was $4.9 million compared to $5.0 million in the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income decreased 3.7% to $9.7 million from $10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets was 3.41% in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 3.44% in the first quarter of 2017 and 3.64% in the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the net interest margin was 3.43% compared to 3.64% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Interest income for the second quarter of 2017 decreased 2.1% to $5.1 million from $5.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, interest income decreased 3.2% to $10.2 million from $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 increased 14.0% to $252,000 from $221,000 for the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased 8.6% to $494,000 from $455,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.      The average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from 3.80% in the second quarter of 2016 to 3.59% for the second quarter of 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased to 3.60% from 3.80% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Much of the decrease in yields from the second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, as well as the six months ending June 30, 2017 and 2016, can be attributed to a decrease in the yield on loans.  While the average loan balances increased 5.3% quarter over quarter and 6.9% comparing the six month periods, the yield on loans decreased from 4.92% in the second quarter of 2016 to 4.61% in the second quarter of 2017. The yield on loans decreased from 4.91% in the six months ending June 30, 2016 to 4.61% in 2017.  This decrease is related to new loans being funded at current market interest rates which are lower than the interest rates on the existing loans in the portfolio.  The average balance of earning assets increased $18.0 million (3.2%) from $565.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $583.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $12.9 million (2.3%) to $581.5 million from $568.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. When compared to the second quarter of 2016, average investment balances increased $1.7 million (0.6%) from $264.42 million during the second quarter of 2016 to $266.1 million during the second quarter of 2017.  Average deposits increased $21.0 million (4.0%) from $521.8 million during the second quarter of 2016 to $542.8 million during the second quarter of 2017.  Average borrowings increased from $14.3 million during the second quarter of 2016 to $15.5 million during the second quarter of 2017. The average cost of funds increased from 0.26% in the second quarter of 2016 and the first six months of 2016 to 0.28% in the second quarter of 2017 and the first six months of 2017.  Noninterest Income and Expense Noninterest income for the second quarter of 2017 was $439,000, up from $363,000 in the second quarter of 2016 and decreased to $858,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from $1.1 million in 2016.   On a quarter over quarter basis, the increase in noninterest income was predominately related to an increase in gain on sale of securities from a loss of $1,000 in 2016 to a gain of $86,000 in 2017.  On a year over year basis, the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a decrease in the gain on sale of securities and a decrease in rental income from OREO properties.  Gain on sale of securities was $281,000 in the first half of 2016 compared to $142,000 for the first half of 2017 and rental income from OREO properties was $106,000 in 2016 compared to zero in 2017, as the income producing property was sold in 2016.    Noninterest expense remained consistent at $3.4 million for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 and decreased from $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017.  While there were many fluctuations in expense related items between the second quarters of 2016 and 2017, two areas of note would be a decrease in salaries and benefits of $37,000 and a decrease in occupancy expenses of $30,000.  On a year over year basis, OREO related expense decreased $328,000 and occupancy expenses decreased $59,000.  The OREO related expense decreased due to the sale of three properties in 2016, including the income producing property which had higher operating costs than the properties currently held by the Company.  Occupancy expense reduction is due to the Company’s continued evaluation of efficiencies in existing office spaces and reductions where necessary. In addition, the Company also experienced a decrease in FDIC assessments of $51,000 from 2016 to 2017.  The decrease in the FDIC assessments relates to a lower assessment rate as a result of the Deposit Insurance Fund reached the FDIC’s target level of 1.15% during 2016, which resulted in lower assessments for community banks such as American River Bank.      The fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio for the second quarter of 2017 remained at 62.3% from the second quarter of 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased to 63.3% from 63.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Provision for Income Taxes Federal and state income taxes for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by $9,000 from $652,000 in the second quarter of 2016 to $643,000 in the second quarter of 2017 and remained at $1.3 million in the first six months of 2016 and 2017.  The lower provision for taxes in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 and for the first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016 resulted from a decrease in taxable income. Earnings Conference Call The second quarter earnings conference call will be held Thursday, July 20, 2017 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).  David T.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release contains certain non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP.  These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis.  Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s financial position reflected in the current quarter and year-to-date results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. Net Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures) In accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio.  The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 34% effective tax rate allows comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments.  The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company’s overhead as a percentage of its revenue.  The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.       Tangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures) Tangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets.  The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create “tangible equity” facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations.  The Company’s management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ materially from the results in these forward-looking statements.  Factors that might cause such a difference include, among other matters, changes in interest rates, economic conditions, governmental regulation and legislation, credit quality, and competition affecting the Company’s businesses generally; the risk of natural disasters and future catastrophic events including terrorist related incidents; and other factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and in subsequent reports filed on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.  The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether to reflect new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
