We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

required if seeking foreign qualification in any
other state.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.

Wyoming LLC fees and other expenses are less than most other states. Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees.  This means we can deliver a quality company package with Wyoming LLC forms for much less than you would pay in Nevada or Delaware.  And, if you incorporate in Wyoming, your state renewal fee is, in most cases, $50, that is 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada for a corporation.

Wyoming Corporate Services shows you why you should form a Wyoming LLC or corporation here. 
Asset Protection
A Wyoming LLC formation or corporation offers its officers and directors the highest degree of protection from lawsuits filed by disgruntled creditors or overzealous plaintiff attorneys.  Doing business as a Wyoming Corporation or LLC can give you advantages like asset protection and business privacy.
The first LLC statutes in the United States were instituted in Wyoming in 1977 and changed in 2010 to stay current with the times.  Since Wyoming has had limited liability companies available longer than any other state and has the strongest laws protecting members and managers of an LLC, we feel it is the state of choice for establishing LLC’s.
Privacy
Wyoming does not require the manager nor the members of a Wyoming LLC to be listed on a public database.   Nevada requires a tax ID number of the company and personal guarantee by you on the state’s business license.
Fast Wyoming Companies
For new Wyoming Corporation or Wyoming LLC formation, we can have your certified documents filed, stamped and returned to us by the state within 1 business day, after you place your order!   Just check the box for that service, in the “extra services” area of the order form.
Freedom
If you have a Wyoming LLC,  you can operate your Corporation and live anywhere in the world; you do not have to be a US citizen to incorporate in Wyoming.  But, in order to give substance to your operation, you should know about our Office Service Contract and learn how use of this inexpensive option will give “presence” to your remote corporate operations.  And, if you are not a US Citizen, we have a section for you to read here.
No State Taxes
Among the many other advantages of incorporation here, there are no State taxes for Wyoming LLCs. If you choose to incorporate in Wyoming, your company may not pay State taxes at all.  Stop for a minute and think what you paid last year in your States income tax.
If you are comparing Nevada and Wyoming LLCs, keep in mind that the Nevada has voted in a bill as of June 2015 installing a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed).  That means that some companies incorporating in Nevada will pay more in Nevada state taxes than they would in California!  This same bill raised the yearly fee for a Nevada corporation by 150%!  Nevada has raised rates on corporations by about 400% in the last 8 years!  Don’t gamble on Nevada.
According to the new 2017 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the seventh year in a row.
Easy to move your company to Wyoming
Wyoming has made it easy to move your existing corporation to Wyoming.  You can move it from any other state to Wyoming.  That service is detailed here.
Special Easy-to-Use Wyoming Corporate Structures
Wyoming has Close Corporations.  These are special companies authorized by the Wyoming Legislature for small business owners.  One advantage of these corporations is that there is less paperwork required to keep them going.  Few states have them.  You can read about them here.
Wyoming now has Close LLCs.  Less paperwork.  Easier to manage.  This type of Wyoming LLC is perfect for a closely held family company.  You can see the details here.
Wyoming has Asset Protection Trusts. This is the best asset protection you can get inside the US. Details are here.
Wyoming Corporate Services, Inc. has been in business in Cheyenne, Wyoming since 2003.  We provide full time Resident Agent Services in the state of Wyoming. We specialize in helping you incorporate in “tax free” Wyoming and have strategies to help you lower your tax liability in your home state, increase your asset protection, and give you back your privacy. We think that you will find the information you need on this site to help you with your Wyoming LLC formation.

Single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets.  Generally, no tax on distribution of appreciated assets.
Single tax at member level. Potential built-in gains taxed if corp. had appreciated property at time of S corp. election.



LLC Footnotes:
Here are a couple of other points about an LLC vs. a Corporation:
If you are looking for state tax savings, an LLC passes the tax through to the members. So, if the member(s) are in a state where you pay state taxes, you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the LLC.
Also, in an LLC you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership. Here is an example: There are two members in an LLC that own it 50/50. However, one member is an investor only, who wants to protect his/her investment by controlling 50% of the company. But, the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than 50% of the profit. Just write in the agreement that the working member gets 75% of the profits, even though he/she only own 50% of the business.
S-Corp Footnotes
Here’s a point about the S-Corporation that could give people paying themselves a salary, an edge. With an S-Corp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can take the balance as profit income. This could lower the amount of self-employment taxes that you have to pay.
Also, in Wyoming we establish all corporations as C Corporations. Wyoming does not have any state taxes, so has no need for S Corporations. If you want S Corporation status, and do not have a Wyoming LLC, you must file Form 2553 with the IRS, which is included in the corporate kit we send you, within 75 days from the date of formation of the company or by March 15th of any given tax year.
There are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form. You should consult with your legal and/or accounting professional to make sure that you make the correct decision between an LLC or corporation.

Wyoming vs Nevada vs Delaware 
Where You Should Incorporate
 Nevada-vs-Wyoming –Delaware – Side By Side Comparison –Why Wyoming
Nevada vs. Wyoming
Wyoming state fees are 92% less than Nevada’s!  Just add that Wyoming corporation advantage up.  Be sure and include the Nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of $125 that you learn about only after you start your company there, a fee Nevada will hit you within 30 days after you start your company, and the $150, or more, filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue.   Oh, and add to that the state business license fee of $500 per year for a corporation!  You are going to be paying at least $625 per year, or more, in Nevada for a corporation, before any other services!
Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees. This means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in Nevada. And, your Wyoming state renewal fee is $50, in most cases, 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada. And, the nice thing about Wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here.  Wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years.  We even offer shelf company services (Click here for pricing.)
According to the new 2016 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the past 7 years in a row.
Perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in Nevada. Here are some reasons explaining why we think Wyoming is the best state to incorporate:
1. Nevada does not share information with the IRS.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada makes the IRS mad. Wyoming does share information with the IRS, but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state.  So the IRS is not targeting you because you are in a non-friendly state (like they may in Nevada).
2. Nevada allows bearer shares.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares, but that law was changed in 2007 to disallow bearer shares.  If you think you need bearer shares, call us first.  You are most likely being misled.  All states have outlawed bearer shares.
3. Nevada has privacy.
Wyoming Answer: Go to the Secretary of State of Nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name and/or first name.  You will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in Nevada.  Go to the Secretary of State of Wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name.  You cannot search using a person’s name.
4. No taxes in Nevada.
Wyoming Answer: No state income taxes on people or companies in Wyoming and Wyoming is not considering any–, Nevada is.  As of July of 2015 Nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed), for some corporations.  That will mean that some companies in Nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in California!  In fact some Nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation!
Don’t gamble on Nevada; research Nevada incorporation myths.
Exploding the Delaware Myth
You may have heard that Delaware is the “incorporation capital” of America. It’s true!  More than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.  If you own a Fortune 500 company (and for your sake, we hope you do) then, by all means, you should strongly consider incorporating in Delaware.  However, if you are a small- or medium-sized business that is more concerned with tax benefits, flexibility, privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape,” then Wyoming is the clear choice for you.
You see, Delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning 110 years regarding such matters as management/shareholder issues and mergers/acquisitions.  That’s precisely why the Fortune 500 are drawn to the state of Delaware.  Delaware laws tend to be “pro-management” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes.  Huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day.  So, if you are managing a Fortune 500 company, Delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do, and what the likely consequences may be.  Unfortunately, Delaware also has corporate income tax, personal income tax, a state franchise tax, reporting requirements, and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you.  We are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business/ entrepreneur clients to incorporate in Delaware.  Well intentioned though it may be, it is not sound advice.
Perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in Delaware.  It’s not too late!  Refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to Wyoming and enjoy the advantages, while preserving the original incorporation date.

Why Wyoming
As you can see from the above list, when comparing Nevada vs. Wyoming incorporation advantages, Wyoming has several that Nevada does not.
Also, with the changes that Nevada has made to its laws, in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012 and in 2015, Wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in.
If you are comparing price, Wyoming is about 65% less to incorporate in than Nevada.
Another thing that they will not tell you about Nevada.  The state is running a deficit and the Nevada State Legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax.  They did pass a gross receipts tax in 2015, which is the worst tax there is, since it does not allow for deductions.
Wyoming is not considering any business income tax.  Don’t gamble on Nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there. Contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today!

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.





Will I have the option to act as my own Registered Agent?

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.

Why Wyoming LLC and Corporations
Why Incorporate in Wyoming
Wyoming LLC fees and other expenses are less than most other states. Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees.  This means we can deliver a quality company package with Wyoming LLC forms for much less than you would pay in Nevada or Delaware.  And, if you incorporate in Wyoming, your state renewal fee is, in most cases, $50, that is 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada for a corporation.
Click here to compare states.  Wyoming is also one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain, in the following years.  (Click here for pricing.)
Wyoming Corporate Services shows you why you should form a Wyoming LLC or corporation here. 
Asset Protection
A Wyoming LLC formation or corporation offers its officers and directors the highest degree of protection from lawsuits filed by disgruntled creditors or overzealous plaintiff attorneys.  Doing business as a Wyoming Corporation or LLC can give you advantages like asset protection and business privacy.
The first LLC statutes in the United States were instituted in Wyoming in 1977 and changed in 2010 to stay current with the times.  Since Wyoming has had limited liability companies available longer than any other state and has the strongest laws protecting members and managers of an LLC, we feel it is the state of choice for establishing LLC’s.
Privacy
Wyoming does not require the manager nor the members of a Wyoming LLC to be listed on a public database.   Nevada requires a tax ID number of the company and personal guarantee by you on the state’s business license.
Fast Wyoming Companies
For new Wyoming Corporation or Wyoming LLC formation, we can have your certified documents filed, stamped and returned to us by the state within 1 business day, after you place your order!   Just check the box for that service, in the “extra services” area of the order form.
Freedom
If you have a Wyoming LLC,  you can operate your Corporation and live anywhere in the world; you do not have to be a US citizen to incorporate in Wyoming.  But, in order to give substance to your operation, you should know about our Office Service Contract and learn how use of this inexpensive option will give “presence” to your remote corporate operations.  And, if you are not a US Citizen, we have a section for you to read here.
No State Taxes
Among the many other advantages of incorporation here, there are no State taxes for Wyoming LLCs. If you choose to incorporate in Wyoming, your company may not pay State taxes at all.  Stop for a minute and think what you paid last year in your States income tax.
If you are comparing Nevada and Wyoming LLCs, keep in mind that the Nevada has voted in a bill as of June 2015 installing a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed).  That means that some companies incorporating in Nevada will pay more in Nevada state taxes than they would in California!  This same bill raised the yearly fee for a Nevada corporation by 150%!  Nevada has raised rates on corporations by about 400% in the last 8 years!  Don’t gamble on Nevada.
According to the new 2017 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the seventh year in a row.
Easy to move your company to Wyoming
Wyoming has made it easy to move your existing corporation to Wyoming.  You can move it from any other state to Wyoming.  That service is detailed here.
Special Easy-to-Use Wyoming Corporate Structures
Wyoming has Close Corporations.  These are special companies authorized by the Wyoming Legislature for small business owners.  One advantage of these corporations is that there is less paperwork required to keep them going.  Few states have them.  You can read about them here.
Wyoming now has Close LLCs.  Less paperwork.  Easier to manage.  This type of Wyoming LLC is perfect for a closely held family company.  You can see the details here.

Tax Information

S-Corp


Tax Rate
Graduated Tax rates from 15% up to 39% apply to taxable income. Personal Service Corporations are taxed at 35% of all income.
There is no tax to the LLC on LLC income.  All profits or losses pass through and are taxed to the members.
There is no tax except in two limited circumstances: (1) Recognized built-in gains and  (2) Excess passive income.


Pass Through of Losses
Losses not passed through.
Losses passed through to members, subject to certain restrictions.
Losses passed through to shareholders, subject to certain restrictions.


Fiscal Year
May use any fiscal year.  Personal Service Corps must use a calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.

Fringe Benefits
Shareholders – Employees are eligible for most.
Members are ineligible for certain ones.
2% shareholders are ineligible for certain ones.


Tax Upon Sale
Potential double taxation. Corporation is taxed on sale of assets, shareholders taxed on dividends or capital gains tax.
Single tax at member level upon sale of appreciated assets.  Generally, no tax on distribution of appreciated assets.
Single tax at member level. Potential built-in gains taxed if corp. had appreciated property at time of S corp. election.



LLC Footnotes:
Here are a couple of other points about an LLC vs. a Corporation:
If you are looking for state tax savings, an LLC passes the tax through to the members. So, if the member(s) are in a state where you pay state taxes, you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the LLC.
Also, in an LLC you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership. Here is an example: There are two members in an LLC that own it 50/50. However, one member is an investor only, who wants to protect his/her investment by controlling 50% of the company. But, the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than 50% of the profit. Just write in the agreement that the working member gets 75% of the profits, even though he/she only own 50% of the business.
S-Corp Footnotes
Here’s a point about the S-Corporation that could give people paying themselves a salary, an edge. With an S-Corp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can take the balance as profit income. This could lower the amount of self-employment taxes that you have to pay.
Also, in Wyoming we establish all corporations as C Corporations. Wyoming does not have any state taxes, so has no need for S Corporations. If you want S Corporation status, and do not have a Wyoming LLC, you must file Form 2553 with the IRS, which is included in the corporate kit we send you, within 75 days from the date of formation of the company or by March 15th of any given tax year.
There are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form. You should consult with your legal and/or accounting professional to make sure that you make the correct decision between an LLC or corporation.

Wyoming vs Nevada vs Delaware 
Where You Should Incorporate
 Nevada-vs-Wyoming –Delaware – Side By Side Comparison –Why Wyoming
Nevada vs. Wyoming
Wyoming state fees are 92% less than Nevada’s!  Just add that Wyoming corporation advantage up.  Be sure and include the Nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of $125 that you learn about only after you start your company there, a fee Nevada will hit you within 30 days after you start your company, and the $150, or more, filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue.   Oh, and add to that the state business license fee of $500 per year for a corporation!  You are going to be paying at least $625 per year, or more, in Nevada for a corporation, before any other services!
Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees. This means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in Nevada. And, your Wyoming state renewal fee is $50, in most cases, 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada. And, the nice thing about Wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here.  Wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years.  We even offer shelf company services (Click here for pricing.)
According to the new 2016 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the past 7 years in a row.
Perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in Nevada. Here are some reasons explaining why we think Wyoming is the best state to incorporate:
1. Nevada does not share information with the IRS.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada makes the IRS mad. Wyoming does share information with the IRS, but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state.  So the IRS is not targeting you because you are in a non-friendly state (like they may in Nevada).
2. Nevada allows bearer shares.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares, but that law was changed in 2007 to disallow bearer shares.  If you think you need bearer shares, call us first.  You are most likely being misled.  All states have outlawed bearer shares.
3. Nevada has privacy.
Wyoming Answer: Go to the Secretary of State of Nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name and/or first name.  You will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in Nevada.  Go to the Secretary of State of Wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name.  You cannot search using a person’s name.
4. No taxes in Nevada.
Wyoming Answer: No state income taxes on people or companies in Wyoming and Wyoming is not considering any–, Nevada is.  As of July of 2015 Nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed), for some corporations.  That will mean that some companies in Nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in California!  In fact some Nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation!
Don’t gamble on Nevada; research Nevada incorporation myths.
Exploding the Delaware Myth
You may have heard that Delaware is the “incorporation capital” of America. It’s true!  More than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.  If you own a Fortune 500 company (and for your sake, we hope you do) then, by all means, you should strongly consider incorporating in Delaware.  However, if you are a small- or medium-sized business that is more concerned with tax benefits, flexibility, privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape,” then Wyoming is the clear choice for you.
You see, Delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning 110 years regarding such matters as management/shareholder issues and mergers/acquisitions.  That’s precisely why the Fortune 500 are drawn to the state of Delaware.  Delaware laws tend to be “pro-management” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes.  Huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day.  So, if you are managing a Fortune 500 company, Delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do, and what the likely consequences may be.  Unfortunately, Delaware also has corporate income tax, personal income tax, a state franchise tax, reporting requirements, and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you.  We are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business/ entrepreneur clients to incorporate in Delaware.  Well intentioned though it may be, it is not sound advice.
Perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in Delaware.  It’s not too late!  Refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to Wyoming and enjoy the advantages, while preserving the original incorporation date.

Why Wyoming
As you can see from the above list, when comparing Nevada vs. Wyoming incorporation advantages, Wyoming has several that Nevada does not.
Also, with the changes that Nevada has made to its laws, in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012 and in 2015, Wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in.
If you are comparing price, Wyoming is about 65% less to incorporate in than Nevada.
Another thing that they will not tell you about Nevada.  The state is running a deficit and the Nevada State Legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax.  They did pass a gross receipts tax in 2015, which is the worst tax there is, since it does not allow for deductions.
Wyoming is not considering any business income tax.  Don’t gamble on Nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there. Contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today!
