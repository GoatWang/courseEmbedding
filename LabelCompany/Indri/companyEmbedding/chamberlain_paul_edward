Economics[edit]
For most of his career Edward Chamberlin taught economics at Harvard (1937–1967). He made significant contributions to microeconomics, particularly on competition theory and consumer choice, and their connection to prices. Edward Chamberlin coined the term "product differentiation" to describe how a supplier may be able to charge a greater amount for a product than perfect competition would allow. In 1962 was admitted as corresponding academician to the RACEF.[1]
His most significant contribution was the Chamberlinian monopolistic competition theory. Chamberlin published his book The Theory of Monopolistic Competition in 1933, the same year that Joan Robinson published her book on the same topic: The Economics of Imperfect Competition, so these two economists can be regarded as the parents of the modern study of imperfect competition. He is also considered one of the first theorists who applied the marginal revenue idea, which is implicit on Cournot´s monopoly theory in the late 1920´s and early 1930´s.[2] Chamberlin is thought to have conducted "not only the first market experiment, but also the first economic experiment of any kind," with experiments he used in the classroom to illustrate how prices don't necessarily reach equilibrium.[3] Chamberlin concludes that most market prices are determined by monopolistic and competitive aspects.[2]
Chamberlin's theory of monopolistic competition is used by sociologist Harrison White in his "markets from networks" model of market structure and competition.
The works of Chamberlin, Robinson, and other contributors to the Structure-Conduct-Performance Paradigm were heavily discounted by game theorists in the 1960s, but Nobel-Prize winner Paul Krugman and others built the foundations of the New Theory of International Trade by combining such theories of industrial structure with production functions that assumed significant economies of scale and scope.

Edward Chamberlin Product Differentiation

Posted by Zera | 13:37 | 




Edward Chamberlin Product Differentiation, Chamberlin EconomicsOne of the most important elements of Chamberlin's new theory of monopolistic competition was that most firms involve themselves not only in price competition but in nonprice competition as well. Though a large number of firms might exist in a market (the competitive element in monopolistic competition), each was viewed by Chamberlin as having a unique product or advantage that gave it some control over price (the monopoly element in monopolistic competition). Each seller, because of this monopoly element, would be able to vary price.What were these monopoly elements? Sraffa had already described some of them in a general way, as we have seen, but Chamberlin specifically noted such items as copyrights, trademarks, brand names, and economic space (i.e., where products might be identical but where buyers, because of the distances involved, would have loca-tional allegiances). Chamberlin clearly expounded the dual nature of most markets:In this field of "products" differentiated by the circumstances surrounding their sale, we may say, as in the case of patents and trade-marks, that both monopolistic and competitive elements are present. The field is commonly regarded as competitive, yet it differs only in degree from others which would at once be classed as monopolistic. In retail trade, each "product" is rendered unique by the individuality of the establishment in which it is sold, including its location (as well as by trademarks, qualitative differences, etc.); this is its monopolistic aspect. Each is subject to the competition of other "products" sold under different circumstances and at other locations; this is its competitive aspect. Here, as elsewhere in the field of differentiated products, both monopoly and competition are always present (The Theory of Monopolistic Competition, p. 63).Many examples of Chamberlin's theory come to mind. Take aspirin (for the moment, ignore the issue of whether all aspirin is the same). Numerous brands exist: Advil, Empirin, Bufferin, Aleve, Bayer, and many, many others. Through advertising and packaging, each brand is established and differentiated, thus creating a market of buyers who demand a specific product. Depending upon the size and intensity of demand in any specific case, the seller can charge a monopolistic price that may differ from that of his or her competitors. Although a large number of substitutes compete for the consumer's aspirin dollar, price differentials can exist.These differences can exist, of course, whether or not all aspirin is alike. Product differentiation, in other words, may convince the consumer that differences exist, even when they in fact do not. The aim of this activity is to increase buyer allegiance for, and the number of buyers of, the product. In this manner, profits are increased (in the short run, at least).Product differentiation, as Chamberlin suggests in the quotation above, may be of yet another form—economic space. Location may differentiate the products of sellers, and it may indeed be the overriding consideration. Suppose, for example, that five drugstores exist in a large city and further assume that they are alike in service and range of offerings. Though the products—drugstores—appear to be alike in every respect, Chamberlin would point out that they are differentiated with respect to location. The degree of monopoly and the degree of freedom with which any store can price will depend upon the number and dispersion of drugstore demanders, as well as upon the location of competing sellers. Location is then part and parcel of product differentiation.A multiplicity of other examples of differentiation could be cited. Automobiles are differentiated, but substitutability still exists. Furniture, toothpaste, suppliers of identical but locationally differentiated raw materials, fine china, the neighborhood grocer, clothing, etc., are all differentiated markets. Chamberlin's point was well made and may be summarized as follows: There exists practically no market that is not characterized by monopoly elements. These monopoly elements are manifested by some form of differentiation: product, location, or service, for example. This fact means that each seller has some control over price, however small. When much (littie) substitutability exists, the demand for the product is more (less) elastic, giving the individual seller less (more) control over price. Whereas Marshall regarded price as the sole variable under analysis in value theory, Chamberlin regarded both price and the product itself as variables under the control of firms in markets characterized by elements of both competition and monopoly.

To make the most of this space, it's helpful to have supplies that make it easy to work in the garage and have plenty of room while you're working on projects. Because we have low prices, every day, on everything, we can help you achieve this for much less than you may think.garage door openersFor easy access to your garage, install a garage door opener. It makes it easy to get into or out of your garage without getting out of your vehicle thanks to an included remote control. You can also go out the garage door from the house with just the touch of a button. These openers are powered by a belt drive and an engine that ranges from 1/2 to 1 horsepower. Most garage door openers have two remotes and allow access via a wireless keypad system. Work benchesBecause you may be working on various projects in your garage, you might want to invest in a workbench too. Many of these workbenches have wood tops with either drawers or open storage space underneath to conveniently house your most used tools. Some workbenches double as sawhorses that have vises attached and allow you to work on projects without holding down the items with your hands. Some workbenches have high backs so you can attach pegboard to hang small tools and other items from it.Garage cabinets and storageIf you need additional storage for items that you want to keep behind closed doors, consider either freestanding cabinets or wall-mounted cabinets. These cabinets can have as many as six shelves and feature one or two sections. Some of the freestanding units have casters on the bottom and allow you to move them about freely. Some units have both drawer and cabinet space if you need to store small tools and larger tools or other items at the same time. The heights on these units range from less than 20 inches to as much as 100 inches or more. The widths range from around 5 inches to more than 45 inches. This variety lets you choose what's best for your needs.Garage shelvingIf enclosed storage isn't what you want, there are several varieties of open shelving units from which you can choose. Most of these feature two to five shelves, with some having a back. Most units stand in one place, but some have casters and allow you to roll them wherever you need them to go. Most are metal with metal shelves or metal with wood composite shelves. Some are plastic for lighter weight or steel for strength, and all shelving comes unassembled.Tool storageSince this is a garage, it's likely that you have several tools lying around. The best way to keep track of your tools is with a tool box to tool chest or by placing them on a pegboard on a wall of the garage. Tool boxes, for the most part, are portable and allow you to carry your essential tools and related items (think nails, screws and other fasteners) to a job site or whenever you might need quick access to them. Tool boxes usually have a top that opens and two or three drawers that slide out. The top is secured with clasps that flip closed. There are also tool bags that work like a tool box but look like a duffel bag. For added portability, we have some tool boxes that resemble luggage and even have wheels that allow you to pull or push them along.For working at home or long term on a job site, a tool chest is more suitable. These have much more space and allow you to store many more tools. These tool boxes have a top that opens, have anywhere from two to eight drawers and sometimes have open storage space on the bottom, ideal for power tools. Although some of these chests are stationary, most of them have casters and allow you to have access to them wherever you're working. Many of these chests are metal, but some are rigid plastic or aluminum too. Red and black are common colors, but there are other colors available, including some that are two-tone. Another feature of tool chests is that they're more secure because you can lock them with a key.Show moreElectrode, Comp-117943442, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
