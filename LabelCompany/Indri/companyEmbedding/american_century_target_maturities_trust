What am I being asked to vote on?
Shareholders of each of the Issuers listed above are being asked to approve the election of four nominated Directors/Trustees (each a “Nominee” and collectively the “Nominees”) to the Board of Directors/Trustees of each Issuer.
When will the special meeting be held? Who can vote?
The special meeting (the “Meeting”) will be held on June 13, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. Central time at American Century Investments’ office at 4500 Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri, 64111. Please note, the Meeting is being held solely for the purpose of voting for the election of directors/trustees. No presentations about the Issuers’ funds (each a “Fund” and collectively the “Funds”) are planned. If you owned shares of one of the Funds at the close of business on April 1, 2016, you are entitled to vote, even if you later sold the shares. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per dollar of shares owned, with fractional dollars voting proportionally.
Why am I being asked to elect the Nominees to the Boards?
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Boards of Directors/Trustees (the “Boards”) are allowed to appoint new Board members to fill vacancies so long as immediately after such appointment, at least two-thirds of the directors/trustees have been elected by shareholders. Five of the seven current Directors/Trustees of each Issuer have been elected by shareholders. The two Directors/Trustees that have not been elected by shareholders were previously appointed by the Boards. Although more than two-thirds of the current Directors/Trustees were elected by shareholders, the Boards are unable to fill additional vacancies without a shareholder vote.
Who are the Nominees for election to the Boards of Directors/Trustees?
The Boards of Directors/Trustees have nominated Anne Casscells, Jonathan D. Levin, Tanya S. Beder and Jeremy I. Bulow for election by shareholders at the Meeting. You are being asked to elect Ms. Casscells and Dr. Levin to fill two vacant positions on each Issuer’s Board of Directors/Trustees. Ms. Casscells and Dr. Levin currently serve as advisory members to the Boards. You are also being asked to elect Ms. Beder and Dr. Bulow, both of whom currently serve on the Boards but have not previously been elected by shareholders. If the four nominated Directors/Trustees are elected, the Boards will have increased flexibility to appoint additional Board members in the future.
How do the Boards recommend that I vote?
The Boards, including all of the Independent Directors/Trustees, unanimously recommend you vote FOR the proposal. For a discussion of the factors the Boards considered in approving the proposal, see the accompanying materials.
My holdings in the Funds are small, why should I vote?
Your vote makes a difference. If many shareholders do not vote their proxies, an Issuer may not receive enough votes to go forward with its special meeting. This means additional costs will be incurred to solicit votes to determine the outcome of the proposal.
Why are multiple proxy cards enclosed?
You will receive a proxy card for each of the Funds in which you are a shareholder. In addition, if you own shares of the same Fund in multiple accounts that are titled differently, you will receive a proxy card for each account.
How do I cast my vote?
You may vote online, by phone, by mail or in person at the special meeting. To vote online, access the Web site listed on a proxy card. To vote by telephone, call the toll-free number listed on a proxy card. To vote online or by telephone, you will need the number that appears in the gray box on each of your proxy cards. To vote by mail, complete, sign and send us the enclosed proxy card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. You also may vote in person at the special meeting on June 13, 2016. If you need more information or have any questions on how to cast your vote, call our proxy solicitor, D. F. King & Co., Inc., at 1-877-361-7971.
What else do I need to know?
Shareholders of the issuer(s) as of April 1, 2016, are eligible to vote on the proposal and will receive a detailed proxy statement in mid-April, 2016.
If you are eligible, we encourage you to vote as soon as possible. The shareholder meeting is scheduled for June 13, 2016.
A proxy statement with respect to the information described above will be mailed to shareholders of record on April 18, 2016 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors are urged to read the proxy statement because it contains important information. The proxy statement and other relevant documents will be available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling 1-800-345-2021.

Why Did My Target Maturity Fund Sock Me with Such Big Gains?






Elizabeth Roy Stanton



Jan 22, 1999 11:38 AM EST













 
















































  (BTTTX) American Century Benham Target Maturities Trust 2020 is a major financial irritant to me. I have been in the fund since October, and on Dec. 11 it declared a $7-plus capital-gains distribution. This is over 20% on a fund with an approximate price of $36. This is a lot of tax for me to pay for being in a zero-coupon fund for two months.   I understand year-end capital-gains distributions, but in this case the investor gets nothing. The fund uses a reverse share split, which raises the fund's share price back to its predividend price. I started in this fund with 2,317 shares, and after distributions ended up with the same amount, plus a couple of percentage points of price appreciation -- and a 20% capital-gains liability! My problem is that the taxable capital gain is so much greater than the imputed interest on the bonds. The bonds are accruing interest at 5% to 6% a year. I understand the fund does some trading, but does that account for the other 15%? --Rich Schneider Rich, It's not as bad as you think. Before I explain why, let me explain a bit about the kind of fund we're talking about, for readers who aren't familiar with it. A target maturity fund attempts to mimic the performance of a zero-coupon bond. Regular bonds pay interest: for example, if you buy a bond with a 6% coupon for $1,000, its face value, the bond pays you $60 a year until it matures, at which point you get your $1,000 back. Zero-coupon bonds have no coupons (hence the name), so they pay no interest. Instead, they are priced at a steep discount to face value. For example, a $1,000 zero-coupon bond maturing in 10 years might cost $500. Target maturity funds are designed to reach a target share price in a certain year, at which point they liquidate. Your fund aims to reach its price target of about $100 in 2020 (hence its name). The American Century target maturity funds, which invest in Treasury zeros, aim to match the performance of a Treasury zero maturing in the target year. There are a couple of important differences, however, between owning shares of a target maturity fund and owning zeros that mature in the target year. The first has to do with interest. Zeros don't pay it. A target maturity fund, on the other hand, "is required by the Internal Revenue Service to distribute dividends based on the zeros' imputed interest," says American Century's   explanation  of how these funds work. Imputed interest is effectively the interest you would have received if the bonds carried coupons. Whether you own zeros or target maturity fund shares, you have to pay tax on them each year. Obviously, like any mutual fund, a target maturity fund also must distribute capital gains each year, and that's the second difference between owning target maturity fund shares and owning zeros. If you own zeros, you pay capital-gains tax only when you sell bonds for more than their imputed value. But if you're a fund shareholder and the fund has taken capital gains, you're going to pay tax on them. Why Such a Big Distribution? Rich, you say you are aware that most funds distribute capital gains at year-end but were blindsided by the size of the distribution on your fund. Indeed, it was a huge distribution. The fund distributed a total of $7.26 on a net asset value of $36.11. Of the total, $2.06 was the dividend and $5.20 was capital gains. No other American Century target maturity fund distributed anywhere near that much in capital gains. So what happened? What happened is that the fund racked up huge gains last year, and lots of investors cashed out, socking those who stayed with the capital-gains distribution. All bonds and bond funds do well when interest rates are dropping, but zero-coupon bonds and funds do the best. So as Treasury yields headed steadily lower last year, the prices of zeros and of target maturity fund shares shot up, as you can see from this   chart  of BTTTX. Consequently, many investors sold. David Schroder, the fund's manager, said that in the year ended Oct. 31, 1998, the period for which capital gains were calculated, the fund's assets dropped to $455 million from $573 million, and the number of shares shrank to 11.8 million from 19.5 million. The large capital gain happened because the fund, which is fully invested, had to sell securities to meet redemptions when prices were high, Schroeder says. The manager says he tries to sell the highest-cost securities first in order to minimize the tax impact, "but there's only so much we can do." Examining the Reverse Split So, all the gains that got taken in order to let the sellers out were distributed to the remaining shareholders. Why shouldn't that upset you? For two reasons. First, the sellers don't get to avoid paying capital-gains tax. They get taxed on their gains on their shares. The second reason has to do with the devilishly complicated reverse share split you mentioned. No shame in this, but I think you partially misunderstand it. When a normal mutual fund makes a distribution, its net asset value drops by the amount of the distribution. If you are reinvesting your distributions, they go to purchase additional shares at the lower, postdistribution price. Target maturity firms work the same way. If you reinvest your distributions, they go to purchase additional shares at the lower, postdistribution price. But immediately after the distribution, a reverse share split is performed. Why? If a target maturity fund's share price dropped every time it made a distribution, the fund would never reach its target price of $100 a share. The reverse share split returns the share price to its predistribution level. Depending on whether you reinvested your dividend or took the cash, you would have either the same number of shares as before, or fewer shares. It's easiest to understand if you think in terms of the total value of your investment. In a regular fund, if you take your distributions in cash, the total value of your investment will be less after the distribution than before; you'll have the same number of shares at a lower price. If you reinvest, the total value will be the same after as before; you'll have more shares at a lower price. In a target maturity fund, if you take your distributions in cash, the total value of your investment will be less; due to the reverse split, you'll have fewer shares than before -- but at the same price. If you reinvest, the total value will be the same; you'll have the same number of shares at the same price. The fact that you have the same number of shares now as before doesn't mean the fund hasn't given you anything. It's given you your predistribution share price back. Remember, if you'd taken your distribution in cash, you'd have fewer shares now than you had before the distribution. Cap Gains Taxes: Pay Now or Pay Later? How does this affect you from a capital-gains standpoint? Assuming you don't intend to hold this fund till maturity, you're going to sell your shares someday, hopefully at a gain. You're paying a big tax bill this year, but that will mean a smaller tax bill when you go to sell. Here's how it works:    You'll be taxed on the difference between the price at which you bought your shares -- your basis -- and the price at which you sell. But you're allowed to increase your basis by the same factor that was used to calculate the reverse share split.  An example, courtesy of American Century: If a reverse share split leaves you with 80% of the shares you had before, you're allowed to divide your basis by 0.8. So if you bought 100 shares at $20, in the event of a 4-for-5 reverse split your basis in those shares would rise to $25 ($20 / 0.8).  But obviously, the size of that factor, 0.8 in the example, depends on the size of the distribution that triggered the reverse share split. The bigger the distribution, the smaller the factor. (The bigger the distribution, the fewer shares someone who took their distributions in cash would wind up with.) The smaller the factor, the more your basis goes up when you divide by it.  The reverse split BTTTX underwent on Dec. 11 was roughly at the rate of 0.8-to-1, or 4-for-5, using whole numbers. So if you bought your shares in October for about $35, your basis in them is now about $43.75. That means you'll pay less tax later.    Elizabeth Roy answers your bond fund questions each Friday.

1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 12-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities. p: Prior year.
