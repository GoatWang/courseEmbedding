We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the offering of our Class A
common shares of approximately $276 million (or approximately $319 million if 
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Class A common
shares in full) after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated aggregate
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale by us of Class A common shares
in this offering for the €257 million partial redemption of the 4.250% First
Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022, and to pay associated redemption 
premiums. We have not determined whether to redeem such notes immediately or at
the time they become callable in June 2017. As a result, we may hold the net 
proceeds, pending application thereof, in cash or short term investments.


Metal Packaging

Our principal competitors in metal packaging include Ball Corporation, Crown
Holdings and Silgan Holdings.
---

Glass Packaging

Our principal competitors in glass packaging include Anchor Glass and
Owens-Illinois in North America and Owens-Illinois, Verallia and Vidrala in
Europe.


Company Description
We are a leading supplier of innovative, value-added rigid packaging solutions.
Our products include metal and glass containers primarily for food and beverage
markets, which are characterized by stable, consumer-driven demand. Our end-use
categories include beer, wine, spirits, carbonated soft


 drinks ("CSDs"), energy
drinks, juices and flavored waters, as well as food, seafood and nutrition. We
also supply the paints & coatings, chemicals, personal care, pharmaceuticals and
general household end-use categories. Our customers include a wide variety of
leading consumer product companies which value our packaging products for their
features, convenience and quality, as well as the end-user appeal they offer
through design, innovation, functionality, premium association and brand
promotion. With our significant invested capital base, extensive technological
capabilities and manufacturing know-how, we believe we are well-positioned to
continue to meet the dynamic needs of our global customers. We have mainly built
our Company through strategic acquisitions and have established leadership
positions in large, attractive markets in beverage cans, food and specialty cans
and glass containers. Approximately 95% of our revenue is derived from end-use
categories where we believe we hold #1, #2 or #3 positions.

We serve over 2,000 customers across more than 80 countries, comprised of
multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local
businesses. In our target regions of Europe, North America and Brazil, our
customers include a wide variety of Consumer Packaged Goods companies ("CPGs"),
which own some of the best known brands in the world. We have a stable customer
base with longstanding relationships, including an average tenure of over 30
years with our ten largest customers. Approximately two-thirds of our sales are
generated under multi-year contracts, with the remainder largely subject to 
annual arrangements. A significant portion of our sales volumes are supplied 
under contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us
deliver consistent margins.

We operate 109 production facilities in 22 countries and employ approximately
23,500 personnel. Our plant network includes 74 metal production facilities and
35 glass production facilities. Our plants are generally located in close 
proximity to our customers, with some located on-site or near-site to our
customers' filling locations. Certain facilities may also be dedicated to 
end-use categories, enhancing product-specific expertise and generating benefits
of scale and production efficiency. Significant capital has been invested in our
extensive network of long-lived production facilities, which, together with our
skilled workforce and related manufacturing process know-how, supports our 
competitive positions.

We are committed to market-leading innovation and product development and 
maintain dedicated innovation, development and engineering centers in France,
Germany, and the U.S. to support these efforts. These facilities focus on three
main areas: (i) innovations that provide enhanced product design,
differentiation and user friendliness for our customers and end-use consumers;
(ii) innovations that reduce input costs to generate cost savings for both our
customers and us (downgauging and lightweighting); and (iii) developments to
meet evolving product safety standards and regulations. Further, our subsidiary,
Heye International GmbH ("Heye International"), is a leading provider of 
engineering solutions to the glass container industry globally, with significant
proprietary know-how and expertise. We also have significant in-house
mold-manufacturing expertise in Europe and the United States.

Our leading global positions have been established through acquisitions, with 23
successful acquisitions completed over the past 18 years. Most recently, on June
30, 2016, we completed the Beverage Can Acquisition, comprising 22 beverage can
production facilities in Europe, North America and Brazil which, on a combined
basis, we believe is the third largest beverage can business globally. Our
beverage can operations are particularly well-positioned in the faster-growing
specialty, or non-standard sized, product category, which, on a pro forma basis
following the Beverage Can Acquisition, represented 37% of total beverage can
unit volume for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

In addition to organic and acquisitive growth initiatives, we have also expanded
our footprint through strategic investments in new capacity. For example, in
2014 we completed a glass furnace investment in the United Kingdom, supported by
a long-term contract with a large European customer. In 2015, we completed an
investment of approximately $220 million in two new can-making facilities in
Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our
Conklin, New York, ends plant. The two new facilities incorporate high-output
drawn and wall ironed ("DWI") technology to manufacture two-piece cans, as well
as three-piece cans, and the total investment across the three facilities has
positioned us to meet substantially all of the U.S. food can requirements of a 
major U.S. customer pursuant to a long-term contract. These initiatives, as well
as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in existing and adjacent
end-use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided
opportunities to grow our business with both existing and new customers.

Heavy Industry

Materials & Chemicals Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Materials and Chemicals is an interdisciplinary heavy industry sector.  Materials industry applies the properties of matter to various areas of science and engineering. It incorporates elements of applied physics and chemistry.  Significant attention in the Materials field is currently focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology. Chemicals are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, and more.
The materials industry and market includes building and construction materials used worldwide for the fabrication of structures, earth supports, embankments, and completion of excavations. Heavy industry materials for construction are diverse and range from readily available non-supply chain materials such as brush and mud to commodity supply materials procured for projects like construction aggregates, composite wood products, plastics (PVC), resins, synthetic textiles and fibers (fiberglass), composite cements, other plastics and polymer composites, concrete, and various metals. Heavy industry metal materials include iron, various grades of steel, specialty alloys, titanium, copper, and even gold, silver, chrome and platinum. Glass, ceramic materials and foam are also subsets of heavy industrial materials required for construction. Finished materials for construction projects can included coated glass, architectural glass, other finished specialty glass projects, cast and molded steel (re-bar and beams), pipe sections, blocks, bricks, tiles, flooring, drywall panels, piles, poles, pillars, and wires.
Radical materials advances can drive the creation of new products and new industries. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing techniques (casting, rolling, welding, ion implantation, crystal growth, thin-film deposition, sintering, glassblowing, etc.), and techniques such as electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, nuclear microscopy (HEFIB), backscattering, neutron diffraction, etc.
The chemical industry comprises the companies that produce industrial chemicals. The chemical industries convert raw materials oil-- metals, air, water, natural gas and minerals-- into products.  Products include chemicals to make plastic for computers, paint for cars, and medicines. Chemical engineers start with cheap, raw, natural materials, such as petrochemicals, seawater, and minerals.
