How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-CCRE27 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





October 13, 2015 12:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM Mortgage Trust 2015-CCRE27 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$38,731,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,542,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$62,544,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$215,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$263,315,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$705,700,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,568,000 class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,732,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$43,088,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,238,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$97,820,000ab class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,238,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,455,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,317,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 13, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $33,772,000ab 
      interest-only class X-D, $13,974,000ab interest-only class X-E, 
      $29,113,392ab interest-only class X-F, $13,974,000a class G or the 
      $29,113,392 class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 65 loans secured by 96 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $931.6 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      lending, L.P., Key Bank National Association and The Bank of New York 
      Mellon.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 66.2% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 78.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool demonstrates high leverage statistics with 
      a Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) of 
      1.13x and 110.9%, respectively. Excluding the credit-assessed 11 Madison 
      Avenue (7.5% of pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.10x and 114.9%, 
      respectively. The 2015 year-to-date average Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.19x 
      and 109.4%, respectively.
    

      Credit Opinion Loan: One loan, 11 Madison Avenue (7.5% of the pool), has 
      an investment-grade credit opinion of 'A-' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Excluding the 11 Madison Avenue loan, Fitch's implied conduit 
      subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is approximately 26.2% and 
      'BBB-sf' is approximately 8.9%.
    

      Collateral Quality: The quality of the assets is generally considered to 
      be above average compared to other conduit transactions. Three loans in 
      the top 10, 11 Madison, NMS Portfolio, and The Drake were assigned Fitch 
      property grades in the 'A' range. As a percentage of Fitch-inspected 
      properties, 41.2% of the pool received a property quality grade of 'B+' 
      or higher. Five properties, 9.9% of the pool, received property quality 
      grades of 'A' range. Eleven inspected properties 12.0% received a 
      property quality grade of 'B-.'
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15.3% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-CCRE27 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      and Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 65 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Fitch Affirms COMM 2015-CCRE27
























NEW YORK, Oct 20, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2015-CCRE27 commercial mortgage trust pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $926 million 
      from $931 million at issuance. Currently, there is one specially 
      serviced loan (0.3%). The loan transferred to the special servicer in 
      April 2016 due to imminent default as a result of extensive damage to 
      the property's roof. No loans have been defeased and interest shortfalls 
      are currently affecting class H.


                                        








Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations with no 
      material changes to pool metrics.


                                        








Below Average Amortization: Eight loans (20.7% of the current balance) 
      are full-term interest-only, and 30 loans (45.5%) are partial 
      interest-only. There are two ARD loans (2.2%). The remainder of the pool 
      consists of 27 balloon loans, with loan terms of five to 10 years. Based 
      on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will pay down 11.3%.


                                        








Multifamily Concentration: The pool has a high percentage of multifamily 
      properties (36.7%), followed by retail (19.5%), and office (18.1%).


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, 11 
      Madison Avenue (7.5%) was assigned a credit opinion of 'A-' on a 
      stand-alone basis at issuance.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other

      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not

      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute

Fitch Affirms COMM 2015-CCRE27 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2015-CCRE27
    





October 20, 2016 01:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2015-CCRE27 commercial mortgage trust pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $926 million 
      from $931 million at issuance. Currently, there is one specially 
      serviced loan (0.3%). The loan transferred to the special servicer in 
      April 2016 due to imminent default as a result of extensive damage to 
      the property's roof. No loans have been defeased and interest shortfalls 
      are currently affecting class H.
    

      Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations with no 
      material changes to pool metrics.
    

      Below Average Amortization: Eight loans (20.7% of the current balance) 
      are full-term interest-only, and 30 loans (45.5%) are partial 
      interest-only. There are two ARD loans (2.2%). The remainder of the pool 
      consists of 27 balloon loans, with loan terms of five to 10 years. Based 
      on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will pay down 11.3%.
    

      Multifamily Concentration: The pool has a high percentage of multifamily 
      properties (36.7%), followed by retail (19.5%), and office (18.1%).
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, 11 
      Madison Avenue (7.5%) was assigned a credit opinion of 'A-' on a 
      stand-alone basis at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      COMM 2015-CCRE27
    

      --$33.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$54.7 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$9.3 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or

      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute

MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE
AGREEMENT

 

This Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement (this “ Agreement ”), is dated and
effective October 29, 2015 between KeyBank National Association, as
seller (the “ Seller ”), and Deutsche Mortgage
& Asset Receiving Corporation, as purchaser (the “
Purchaser ”).

 

The Seller desires to sell, assign,
transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser
desires to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below, the commercial, multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured
housing mortgage loans (collectively, the “ Mortgage
Loans ”) identified on the schedule annexed hereto as
Exhibit A (the “ Mortgage Loan Schedule
”).

 

It is expected that the Mortgage
Loans will be transferred, together with other commercial,
multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured housing or parking
mortgage loans (such Mortgage Loans, the “ Other Mortgage
Loans ”) to COMM 2015-CCRE27 Mortgage Trust, a trust fund
(the “ Trust Fund ”) to be formed by the
Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by a
series of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates (the
“ Certificates ”). The offer and sale of certain
classes of the Certificates (the “ Registered
Certificates ”) will be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act
”). The Trust Fund will be created and the Certificates will
be issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement, dated as
of October 1, 2015 (the “ Pooling and Servicing
Agreement ”), between the Purchaser, as depositor (in
such capacity, the “ Depositor ”), Midland Loan
Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as master
servicer (the “ Master Servicer ”), Rialto
Capital Advisors, LLC, as special servicer (the “ Special
Servicer ”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
trustee (in such capacity, the “ Trustee ”),
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate
administrator (in such capacity, the “ Certificate
Administrator ”), custodian and paying agent, and Park
Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the “
Operating Advisor ”). 

 

The Purchaser intends to sell the
Registered Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“
DBSI ”), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“
CF&Co. ”), KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. (“
KeyBanc ”), CastleOak Securities, L.P. (“
CastleOak ”) and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“
GS&Co. ” and, together with DBSI, CF&Co.,
KeyBanc and CastleOak, in their capacities as underwriters, the
“ Underwriters ”) pursuant to an underwriting
agreement, dated as of October 20, 2015 (the “
Underwriting Agreement ”). The Purchaser intends to
sell other Certificates (the “ Non-Registered
Certificates ”) to DBSI, CF&Co., KeyBanc and Wells
Fargo Securities, LLC (“ WFS ” and, together
with DBSI, CF&Co and KeyBanc, in their capacities as initial
purchasers, the “ Initial Purchasers ” and,
together with the Underwriters, the “ Principals
”) pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement, dated as of
October 20, 2015 (the “ Certificate Purchase Agreement
”). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein
have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date) or in the
Indemnification Agreement, dated October 20, 2015 (the “
Indemnification Agreement ”), between the Seller, the
Purchaser and the Principals.

 

Now, therefore, in consideration of
the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

 

 



 

  

Section

Purchase.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign,
transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser upon receipt of the

Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans. The purchase and
sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on or about October 29,
2015 or such other date as shall be mutually acceptable to the
parties hereto (the “ Closing Date ”). As of the
Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans will have an aggregate principal
balance (the “ Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance
”), after application of all payments of principal due
thereon on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received, of
$194,035,645, subject to a variance of plus or minus 5.0%. The
purchase price of the Mortgage Loans (inclusive of accrued interest
and exclusive of the Seller’s share of the costs set forth in
Section 9 hereof) (the “ Mortgage Loan Purchase Price
”) shall be equal to the amount set forth on the cross
receipt between the Seller and the Purchaser dated the date hereof
(the “ Cross Receipt ”).

 

Section
2.

Loans.

 

(a)         On
the Closing Date, subject only to receipt by the Seller of the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing
conditions required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates,
the Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, set over and
otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and without limiting Section
4(a) hereof without recourse, all the right, title and interest
of the Seller from and after the Closing Date in and to the
following property whether now owned or existing or hereafter
acquired or arising (the “ Covered Assets ”):
the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule,
including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which,
notwithstanding the foregoing, includes all interest and principal
received or receivable by the Seller on or with respect to the
Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in
the next sentence), together with all of the Seller’s right,
title and interest in and to the proceeds of any related title,
hazard, or other insurance policies and any escrow, reserve or
other compa rable
accounts related to the Mortgage Loans, but excluding any KeyBank
Defeasance Rights and Obligations with respect to the Mortgage
Loans, subject to that certain Agreement to Appointment of Master
Servicer dated as of October
1, 2015 , between
the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Seller.
The Purchaser shall be entitled to
(and, to the extent received by or on behalf of the Seller, the
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the
direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled payments of principal and
interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all
other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after
the Cut-off Date; provided , that all scheduled payments of
principal and interest due on or before the Cut-off Date and
collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Seller, and
the Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall promptly remit any
such payments to the Seller.

 

Within 45 days after the Closing
Date or, without limiting the requirements of the first paragraph
of Section 2(d), after such later date on which the Seller has
received all the missing filing/recording information, the Seller
shall, or shall at the expense of the Seller cause a third party

otherwise) to, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and submit

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates” (in such capacity and, with respect to any
Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of any related Serviced
Companion Loan Noteholders)) in the appropriate public recording
office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in
clause (iii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been
submitted for recording and (b) each Reassignment of
Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits referred to in
clause (viii)(B) of Exhibit B (if not otherwise
included in the related Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet
been submitted for recordation; and (2) complete (to the
extent necessary) and file in the appropriate public filing office
each UCC assignment of financing statement referred to in
clause (v)(B) and (xiii) of Exhibit B which has not yet
been submitted for filing or recording. Each such document shall
reflect that the recorded original should be returned by the public
recording office to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Seller
or its designee as an alternative) following recording, and each
such document shall reflect that the file copy thereof should be
returned to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Seller or its
designee as an alternative) following filing; provided that
in those instances where the public recording office retains the
original Assignment of Mortgage or Reassignment of Assignment of
Leases, Rents and Profits, the Custodian shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain therefrom a certified copy of the
recorded original, at the expense of the Depositor. In the event
that any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded
or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the
Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a
substitute therefor or cure or cause the curing of such defect, as
the case may be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or
corrected document to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any
subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including, without
limitation, the Trustee) for recording or filing, as appropriate,
at the Seller’s expense. In the event that the Seller
receives the original recorded or filed copy, the Seller shall, or
shall cause a third party vendor or any other party under its
control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed
copy (and in no event later than 5 Business Days following such
receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of
filing or recording thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 2 , in those instances
where the public recording office retains the original Mortgage,
Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or
Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if
applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder
of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery
to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such
Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and
Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and
Profits.

 

On the Closing Date, upon (i)
notification from the Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price
referred to in Section 1 has been received by the
Seller and (ii) the issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser
shall be authorized to release to the Certificate Administrator or
its designee all of the Mortgage Files in the Purchaser’s
possession relating to the Mortgage Loans.

 

(b)         In
connection with the Seller’s assignment pursuant to
subsection (a) above, and subject to subsections (c) and (d)
below, the Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be
delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, on or before the
Closing Date, the documents and/or instruments referred to in
clauses (i) , (ii) , (vii) ,
(xi) and (xix) of Exhibit B for each Mortgage
Loan so assigned (with originals with respect to clause (i)
and copies with respect to clauses (ii) , (vii) ,
(xi) and (xix) ) and, except as otherwise provided in
Section 2(d) below, within 30 days following the Closing
Date, the remaining applicable documents in Exhibit B for
each such Mortgage Loan, with copies to the Master
Servicer.

(c)         If
the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any
Mortgage Loan, the original Note, the Seller shall deliver a copy
or duplicate original of such Note, together with an affidavit
certifying that the original thereof has been lost or destroyed and
an indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the
Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the
Custodian.

 

(d)         If
the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any
Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents
and/or instruments referred to in clauses  (ii) ,
(iii) , (v)(A) , (viii)(A) , (xiv) and
(xvi) of Exhibit B and the UCC financing
statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to
in clause  (xiii) of Exhibit B , with
evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay
caused by the public recording or filing office where such document
or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or
because such original recorded or filed document has been lost or
returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost,
as the case may be, the delivery requirements of
Section 2(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as
to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have
been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a
copy of such document or instrument (without evidence of recording
or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to
multiple documents and/or instruments) by the applicable public
recording or filing office, the applicable title insurance company
or by the Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original
thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has
been delivered to the Custodian within 45 days after the Closing
Date, and either the original of such missing document or
instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence of recording or
filing, as the case may be, thereon, is delivered to or at the
direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected
Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee) within 180
days after the Closing Date (or within such longer period after the
Closing Date as the Custodian may consent to, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as the
Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording
or filing, as the case may be, or has certified to the Custodian as
to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be,
and is, as certified to the Custodian no less often than quarterly,
in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate public
recording or filing office such original or copy, provided such
extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).

 

If the Seller cannot deliver, or
cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a
copy of the related lender’s title insurance policy referred
to in clause  (vii) of Exhibit B solely
because such policy has not yet been issued, the delivery
requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be
satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be
deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File,
provided that the Seller has delivered to the Custodian a
binder marked as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or
its authorized agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title
insurance policy which has been accepted or approved in writing as
binding by the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged
closing instruction or escrow letter, and the Seller shall deliver
to the Custodian or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any
subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without
limitation the Trustee), promptly following the receipt thereof,
the original related lender’s title insurance policy (or a
copy thereof).

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in clause
(xix) and clause (xx) on Exhibit B , the
Seller acknowledges that the Master

 





4 






 


 

Servicer will hold the original of
each such document in trust on behalf of the Trustee in order to
draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust and the Seller
shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery requirements of this
Agreement by delivering the original of each such document to the
Master Servicer. The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or
amendment of such letter of credit required (which assignment or
amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to
the Trust in care of the Master Servicer) in order for the Master
Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust.
In the event that the documents specified in clause (xx) on
Exhibit B are missing with respect to any Mortgage Loan
because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been
completed, the Seller shall take all reasonably necessary steps to
enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit
on behalf of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the
letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions
from the Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or
causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master
Servicer.

 

Contemporaneously with the execution
of this Agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller shall
deliver a power of attorney substantially in the form of
Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the
Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take such other
action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or
recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating to any
Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded
at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund. The Seller
will be required to effect at its expense the assignment and, if
applicable, recordation of its Loan Documents until the assignment
and recordation of all such Loan Documents has been
completed.

 

(e)         Except
as provided below, all documents and records in the Seller’s
possession (or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans
that are not required to be a part of a Mortgage File in accordance
with Exhibit B but that are reasonably required to
service the Mortgage Loans and copies of the documents in the
Mortgage File (all such other documents and records, including
Environmental Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan, the “
Servicing File ”), together with all escrow payments,
reserve funds and other comparable funds in the possession of the
Seller (or under its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans,
shall (unless they are held by a sub-servicer that shall, as of the
Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer
pursuant to a written agreement between such parties) be delivered
by the Seller (or its agent) to the Master Servicer (as the
Purchaser’s designee) no later than the Closing Date;
provided , the Seller shall not be required to deliver, and
the Servicing File shall not be deemed to include drafts of Loan
Documents, attorney-client or internal communications of the Seller
or its affiliates or Seller’s credit underwriting or due
diligence analyses or related data (as distinguished from
Environmental Reports, financial statements, credit reports, title
reports, structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other
reports, analyses or data provided by the Borrowers or third
parties other than the Seller’s attorneys). If a sub-servicer
shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master
Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to a written
agreement between such parties, the Seller or its agent shall
deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master
Servicer.

 

(f)         Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective
records will reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the
Purchaser as a sale, including for tax, accounting and any
regulatory purposes. Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans
to the

 





5 






 


 

Purchaser, the Seller will not take
any action inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by
the Purchaser or its assignees.

 

(g)         Furthermore,
it is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance
of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser as provided in this
Agreement be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by
Seller to Purchaser and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by
Seller to Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of Seller.
However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the
parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of Seller or if
for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a
security interest in the Mortgage Loans:

 

(i)           this
Agreement shall hereby create a security agreement within the
meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in
effect in the applicable state;

 

(ii)          the
conveyance provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from
Seller to Purchaser, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, a
security interest in and to all of Seller’s right, title, and
interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the
Covered Assets and all proceeds thereof;

 

(iii)         the
possession by Purchaser or its assignee of the Notes and such other
goods, letters of credit, advices of credit, instruments, money,
documents, chattel paper or certificated securities shall be deemed
to be possession by the secured party or possession by a purchaser
or a Person designated by him or her, for purposes of perfecting
the security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code
(including, without limitation, Sections 9-306, 9-313 and 9-314
thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction; and

 

(iv)         notifications
to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts,
confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed
to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents
of, or Persons holding for (as applicable), Purchaser or its
assignee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
applicable law.

 

The Seller at the direction of the
Purchaser or its assignee, shall, to the extent consistent with
this Agreement, take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to
ensure that such security interest is a perfected security interest
of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained as
such. In connection herewith, Purchaser and its assignee shall have
all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor
under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the relevant
jurisdiction and may execute and file such UCC Financing Statements
as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to accomplish the
foregoing.

 

(h)         It
is further acknowledged and agreed by the Seller that the Purchaser
intends to convey all right, title and interest of the Purchaser
from and after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans and
all rights and remedies under this Agreement (excluding the
Purchaser’s rights and remedies under Sections
6(e)-(g) , 9 and 11 of this Agreement) to the
Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, including, without
limitation, all rights and remedies as may be available under
Section 6 to the Purchaser in the event of a Material Breach
or a

 





6 






 


 

Material Defect, and the Trustee on
behalf of the Certificateholders, as assignee of the Purchaser, or
such other party as may be specified in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, shall be entitled to enforce any obligations of the
Seller hereunder in connection with a Material Breach or a Material
Defect as if the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders had
been an original party to this Agreement.

 

Section
3.         
Examination of Mortgage Files and
Due Diligence Review.

 

The Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with any examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing
Files that may be undertaken by or on behalf of the Purchaser. The
fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any
partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Files and/or
Servicing Files shall not affect the Purchaser’s right to
pursue any remedy available in equity or at law under Section
6 for a breach of the Seller’s representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in or contemplated by Section
4 .

 

Section
4.         
Representations, Warranties and
Covenants of the Seller.

 

(a)         The
Seller hereby makes, as of the date hereof (or as of such other
date specifically provided in the particular representation or
warranty), to and for the benefit of the Purchaser, each of the
representations and warranties set forth in Exhibit D
with respect to each Mortgage Loan, subject to the exceptions set
forth in Schedule D-1 to Exhibit D .

 

(b)         In
addition, the Seller, as of the date hereof, hereby represents and

of America and is in compliance with the laws of each State in
which any Mortgaged Property is located to the extent necessary to
ensure the enforceability of each Mortgage Loan and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(ii)         The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, and the
performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement by
the Seller, do not violate the Seller’s organizational
documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or
result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument
to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its
assets, in each case which materially and adversely affects the
ability of the Seller to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(iii)        The
Seller has the full organizational power and authority to enter
into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement.

 

(iv)        This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation of
the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with the
terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy,

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “
Dodd-Frank Act ”), the powers of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation as receiver under Title II (Orderly
Liquidation Authority) of the Dodd-Frank Act, (B) general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforcement is

policy considerations underlying the securities laws, to the extent
that such public policy considerations limit the enforceability of
the provisions of this Agreement that purport to provide
indemnification or contribution for securities laws
liabilities.

 

(v)         The
Seller is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the
terms of this Agreement do not constitute a violation of, any law,
any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter, or any
order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local
governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the
Seller’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to
affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Seller to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial
condition of the Seller.

 

(vi)        No
litigation is pending or, to the best of the Seller’s
knowledge, threatened against the Seller the outcome of which, in
the Seller’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to
materially and adversely affect the ability of the Seller to

condition of the Seller.

necessary in connection with the Seller’s sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
(2) such consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications,
registrations, filings or notices as have been obtained, made or
given and (3) where the lack of such consent, approval,
authorization, qualification, registration, filing or notice would
not have a material adverse effect on the performance by the Seller
under this Agreement.

 

(ix)         Except

firm engaged to provide procedures involving a comparison of
information in loan files for the Mortgage Loans to information on

Exchange Act) in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein and in the Prospectus Supplement and, except for the
accountants with respect to the Accountants’ Due Diligence
Report, the Seller has not employed (and, through and including the

be contemplated under the existing comfort letter), and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement shall require the Master Servicer to use
reasonable efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to
acquire such replacement comfort letter, if necessary (or to
acquire any such new document or acknowledgement as may be
contemplated under the existing comfort letter).

execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, and the
performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement by

9 






 


 

not violate the Purchaser’s
organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement
or other instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable
to it or any of its assets.

 

(iii)         The
Purchaser has the full power and authority to enter into and
consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has
duly authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and has duly executed and delivered this

the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with
the terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally, and
(B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law.

 

(v)          The
Purchaser is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of
this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the
terms of this Agreement will not constitute a violation of, any
law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter, or any
order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local
governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the
Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to
affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Purchaser
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial
condition of the Purchaser.

 

(vi)         No
litigation is pending or, to the best of the Purchaser’s
knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser which would prohibit

to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial
condition of the Purchaser.

Purchaser has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent
or other Person, other than the Seller, the Principals and their
respective affiliates, that may be entitled to any commission or
compensation in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage Loans
or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(viii)         No
consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or
filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is
required, under federal or state law, for the Purchaser’s

of any transaction contemplated hereby, other than (1) such
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, registrations,
filings or notices as have been obtained, made or given and
(2) where the lack of such consent, approval, authorization,
qualification, registration, filing or notice would not have a
material adverse effect on the performance by the Purchaser under
this Agreement.

(ix)         The
Purchaser (A) prepared one or more reports on Form ABS-15G (each, a
“ Form 15G ”) containing the findings and
conclusions of the Accountant’s Due Diligence Report and
meeting the requirements of that Form 15G, Rule 15Ga-2, any other
rules and regulations of the Commission and the Exchange Act; (B)
provided a copy of the final draft of each such Form 15G to the
Principals at least 6 Business Days before the first sale in the
offering contemplated by the Prospectus Supplement; and (C)
furnished each such Form 15G to the Commission on EDGAR at least 5
Business Days before the first sale in the offering contemplated by
the Prospectus Supplement as required by Rule 15Ga-2.

 

(b)         Upon
discovery by any of the parties hereto of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth above which materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Seller, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice of such
breach to the other party or parties hereto.

 

Section
6.         
Repurchases;
Substitutions.

 

(a)         If
the Purchaser discovers that any document constituting a part of a
Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods
provided for herein, has not been properly executed, is missing,
does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information
that does not conform in any material respect with the
corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule
(each, a “ Defect ”), or discovers or receives
notice of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller
made pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement with
respect to any Mortgage Loan (a “ Breach ”), and
if such Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material
Breach, then the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the
Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special
Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating
Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Seller. If any such Defect or
Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage
Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests
in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser, or
causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a
“qualified mortgage” (within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage
loan to be treated as a “qualified mortgage”), then
such Defect shall constitute a “ Material Defect
” or such Breach shall constitute a “ Material
Breach ,” as the case may be; provided , that if
any of the documents specified in clauses (i) , (ii)
, (vii) , (xi) and (xix) of the definition of
“Mortgage File” is (subject to
Sections 2(c) and 2(d) hereof) not delivered,
and is certified as missing pursuant to Section 2.02 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, it shall be deemed a Material
Defect. Promptly upon receiving written notice of any Material
Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan,
accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by
this sentence, the Seller shall, not later than 90 days from the
Seller’s receipt from the Purchaser (or, following the
assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund or any other
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, on behalf of the
Trust Fund) of notice of, and demand to take action with respect
to, such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be
(or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating
to a Mortgage Loan not being a “qualified mortgage” as
described in the preceding sentence, not later than 90 days after
the Seller or any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
discovers such Material Defect or Material Breach, provided that
the Seller
 





11 






 

 

has received notice in accordance
with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) (any such
90-day period, the “ Initial Resolution Period
”), (i) cure the same in all material respects,
(ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable
Repurchase Price or (iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan ( provided
that in no event shall such substitution occur later than the
second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay to the Master
Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account any Substitution
Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided that if
(i) such Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one
relating to a deemed Material Defect under the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not
within the Initial Resolution Period, (ii) such Material
Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage
Loan’s not being a “qualified mortgage” within
the meaning of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has
commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such
Material Defect or Material Breach within the Initial Resolution
Period, then the Seller shall have an additional period equal to
the applicable Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure
or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or
substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged
Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant
(operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home,
assisted living facility, self storage facility, theatre or fitness
center (operated by a Borrower), then the failure to deliver to the
Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to
such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.

 

If the Seller is notified of a
Defect in any Mortgage File that also affects information set forth
in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Seller shall promptly correct
such Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to
the Purchaser, which corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be
deemed to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for
all purposes. The failure of the Master Servicer, the Special
Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or
the Trustee to notify the Seller of a Material Defect or Material
Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure or repurchase
obligation, provided that the Seller must receive written
notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a) before
commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.

 

If (x) there exists a Breach of any
representation or warranty on the part of the Seller as set forth
in, or made pursuant to, representation 30 or 32 of Exhibit
D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by
the Borrower associated with the exercise of a defeasance option, a
waiver of a “due-on-sale” provision or a
“due-on-encumbrance” provision or the release of any
Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically
prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring the
related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon receipt
of notice from the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, the Seller
may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account,
within 90 days of the Seller’s receipt of such notice, the
amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that
are the basis of such Breach. Upon its making such deposit, the
Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects.
Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole
remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any
such Breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a Material
Breach, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or
otherwise cure such Breach.

 





12 






 


 

Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6(a) , in lieu of the Seller
performing its obligations with respect to any Material Breach or
Material Defect provided in the three preceding paragraphs, to the
extent that the Seller and the Purchaser (or, following the
assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Special
Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund, and, if no Control
Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent
of the Controlling Class Representative) are able to agree upon a
cash payment payable by the Seller to the Purchaser (or its
assignee) that would be deemed sufficient to compensate the
Purchaser (or its assignee) for a Material Breach or Material
Defect (a “ Loss of Value Payment ”), the Seller
may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value
Payment to the Purchaser (or its assignee); provided that a
Material Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan
not constituting a “qualified mortgage”, within the
meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3), may not be cured by a Loss of
Value Payment. Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall be
deemed to have cured such Material Breach or Material Defect in all
respects. Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes
the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees
regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect, and the
Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or replace the related
Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material
Defect.

 

(b)         In
connection with any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage
Loan contemplated by this Section 6 :

 

(i)          the
Custodian, the Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage
Loan other than a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer
(with respect to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially
Serviced Loan), pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
shall each be required to tender to the Seller, and the Seller
shall be entitled to receive therefrom, all portions of the
Mortgage File (in the case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File
(in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as
applicable) and any and all other documents pertaining to such
Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery:

 

(A)         
to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a
trust receipt, and

 

(B)          
to the Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as
applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement by the
Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt
of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount from
the Seller;

 

(ii)         each
document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was
endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned
without recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided
to the Custodian by the Seller, as the case may be, to the Seller
as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller the legal and
beneficial ownership of each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent
such ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and

 

(iii)         the
Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the
Special Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any escrow
payments and reserve

 





13 






 


 

funds held by or on behalf of the
Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the
Special Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed
Mortgage Loan(s) to the Seller.

 

(c)         This
Section 6 provides the sole remedies with respect to
the Mortgage Loans available to the Purchaser, and its successors
and permitted assigns ( i.e. , the Trustee and the holders
of the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or
any Breach. If the Seller defaults on its obligations to cure, to
repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance
with this Section 6 , or disputes its obligation to
cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in
accordance with Section 6 , the Purchaser may take such
action as is appropriate to enforce such payment or performance,
including, without limitation, the institution and prosecution of
appropriate proceedings. To the extent the Purchaser prevails in
such proceeding, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all
necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the enforcement of such obligation of the Seller to cure, to
repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance
with this Section 6 . To the extent the Seller prevails
in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for
all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such proceeding.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one
or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the Seller
shall not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if
(i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant
to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan
Documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released),
(ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the
requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents and the
Seller provides an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur and
(iii) each Rating Agency then rating the Certificates shall
have provided a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to such
release.

 

(d)         As
to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the
Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special
Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO
Properties), the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian for such
Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master
Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed
as required by Exhibit B hereto. Pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to
Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of
substitution shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received
by the Master Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to
the related Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date. For
the month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to
Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed
Mortgage Loan and received by the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of
repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and the Seller shall be
entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect of
such Removed Mortgage Loan.

 

In any month in which the Seller
substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for
one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant to this Agreement, the
Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution
Shortfall Amount. At the direction of the Certificate
Administrator, the Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master
Servicer for

 





14 






 


 

deposit, into the Collection Account
cash equal to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the
Mortgage Files for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans,
without any reimbursement thereof. Any Mortgage Loan that is
repurchased or replaced by the Seller pursuant to this
Section 6 shall constitute a “ Removed
Mortgage Loan ”.

 

(e)         If
the Seller (i) receives from any Person (other than the
Depositor) any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request;
(ii) rejects any Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the
Person making any Repurchase Request as to the merits of such
Repurchase Request (a “ Dispute ”); or (iii)
receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request
Withdrawal, then the Seller shall deliver notice thereof (each, a
“ Rule 15Ga-1 Notice ”) to the Depositor within
ten (10) Business Days of the Seller’s receipt (or in the
case of a rejection or Dispute, the occurrence or commencement)
thereof. Each Rule 15Ga-1 Notice shall include (i) the identity of
the related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase
Communication of the Repurchase Request or the Repurchase Request
Withdrawal was received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a
Repurchase Request, the identity of the Person making such
Repurchase Request and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase
Request (as asserted in the Repurchase Request).

 

“ Repurchase
Communication ” means, for purposes of this Section
6(e) only, any communication, whether oral or written, which
need not be in any specific form.

 

(f)         The
Seller shall provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form
ABS-15G that the Seller is required to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (only to the extent that such portions relate
to any Mortgage Loan) pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange
Act on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days before the
date such Form ABS-15G is required to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In connection with such filing, upon the
request of the Seller, the Depositor shall provide to the Seller
the Trust Fund’s Central Index Key (CIK) number and such
other information regarding the principal balances of the Mortgage
Loans as is reasonably necessary for the Seller to complete and
file such Form ABS-15G.

 

(g)         The
Seller agrees that a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in
connection with providing the Seller with any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice
(for purposes of this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement), be required to provide any
information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product doctrines. In addition, the Seller hereby acknowledges
that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to
Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
is so provided only to assist the Seller, the Depositor and its
Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items
1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or
regulation and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction
of, a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and (B) no information
provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement by a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any
legal right the Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may have with respect
to this Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request
that is the subject of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice.

 

(h)         Each
party hereto agrees that the receipt of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice or the
delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to this
Section 6 shall not, in and of

 





15 






 


 

itself, constitute delivery of
notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the Seller of, any
Material Defect or Material Breach.

 

Section
7.         
Closing.

 

The closing of the purchase and sale
of the Mortgage Loans (the “ Closing ”) shall be

The Seller hereby agrees to deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser and the Certificate
Administrator disclosures of all material information relating to
any event, specifically relating to and actually known by the
Seller, reasonably determined in good faith by the Seller as

The agreement establishes the terms and condition of the loan between the two parties.Information contained within the agreement will include the original price of the loan amount, the interest rate for the borrower, the type of interest rate (variable vs. fixed rate) and the term length of the mortgage, with a beginning and end date for the mortgage.The document may also include a payment schedule for the loan, detailing when and how payment installments shall be made by the borrower.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $926 million from $931 million at issuance. Currently, there is one specially serviced loan (0.3%). The loan transferred to the special servicer in April 2016 due to imminent default as a result of extensive damage to the property's roof. No loans have been defeased and interest shortfalls are currently affecting class H.Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level performance generally in line with issuance expectations with no material changes to pool metrics.Below Average Amortization: Eight loans (20.7% of the current balance) are full-term interest-only, and 30 loans (45.5%) are partial interest-only. There are two ARD loans (2.2%). The remainder of the pool consists of 27 balloon loans, with loan terms of five to 10 years. Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool will pay down 11.3%.Multifamily Concentration: The pool has a high percentage of multifamily properties (36.7%), followed by retail (19.5%), and office (18.1%).Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, 11 Madison Avenue (7.5%) was assigned a credit opinion of 'A-' on a stand-alone basis at issuance.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:COMM 2015-CCRE27--$33.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$72.5 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$62.5 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$200 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$278.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$53.6 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$700.7 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$54.7 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$97.8 million* class X-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$43.1 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$51.2 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$51.2 million* class X-C at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$24.5 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$9.3 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;* Notional amount and interest only.Fitch does not rate the class G, H, X-D, X-E, or X-F certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchCOMM 2015-CCRE27 Mortgage Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/871684Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013437Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013437Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.

Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
