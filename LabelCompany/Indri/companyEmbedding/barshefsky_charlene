Early life, education, and career[edit]
Barshefsky was raised in a Jewish family on the North Side of Chicago, to Gustave, a Polish immigrant and chemical engineer, who died in 1995, and Miriam, a Russian immigrant and retired substitute teacher.[2] She has one brother, Alvin Barshefsky, and one sister, Annette Weinshank.[2] In 1968, Barshefsky graduated from Von Steuben High School.[2] In 1972, Barshefsky graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor's degree double majoring in English and Political Science. In 1975, she earned her J.D. from the Columbus School of Law of The Catholic University of America.
Barshefsky was nominated by former President Bill Clinton to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative along with Rufus Yerxa and Richard W. Fisher. In 1999 she was the primary negotiator with China's Zhu Rongji, laying out the terms for China's eventual entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Her negotiations have been analyzed in Harvard Business School case studies.[1]
Legal practice[edit]
As of June 2012, Barshefsky is a Senior International Partner at WilmerHale. Her legal practice focuses on international business transactions, commercial agreements, and regulatory impediments to exporting and investment. Specifically, her expertise lies in "crafting market penetration strategies for goods, services, and investment and devising practical solutions to market access barriers". Her clients include Fortune 100 and other multinational companies that services like trade litigation, dispute resolution, and government relations strategies. She also advises foreign corporations on commercial and regulatory issues in the United States.[1]
Barshefsky has written and lectured extensively on both U.S. and foreign trade laws and public procurement regimes. She was a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. She previously served as Vice Chair of the International Law Section of the American Bar Association as well as a member of its governing council and chair of its Publications Committee.
Personal life[edit]
Outside of her legal practice, Ambassador Barshefsky participates in several professional organizations; she is a board member of the America-China Society, a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Trilateral Commission. She also serves on the boards of Intel, American Express, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Estée Lauder, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[1] She also sits on the advisory board for America Abroad Media.[3]
Barshefsky lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband. They have two daughters.

Barshefsky was raised in a Jewish family on the North Side of Chicago, to Gustave, a Polish immigrant and chemical engineer, who died in 1995, and Miriam, a Russian immigrant and retired substitute teacher.[2] She has one brother, Alvin Barshefsky, and one sister, Annette Weinshank.[2] In 1968, Barshefsky graduated from Von Steuben High School.[2] In 1972, Barshefsky graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor's degree double majoring in English and Political Science. In 1975, she earned her J.D. from the Columbus School of Law of The Catholic University of America.
Barshefsky was nominated by former President Bill Clinton to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative along with Rufus Yerxa and Richard W. Fisher. In 1999 she was the primary negotiator with China's Zhu Rongji, laying out the terms for China's eventual entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Her negotiations have been analyzed in Harvard Business School case studies.[1]
Legal practice[edit]
As of June 2012, Barshefsky is a Senior International Partner at WilmerHale. Her legal practice focuses on international business transactions, commercial agreements, and regulatory impediments to exporting and investment. Specifically, her expertise lies in "crafting market penetration strategies for goods, services, and investment and devising practical solutions to market access barriers". Her clients include Fortune 100 and other multinational companies that services like trade litigation, dispute resolution, and government relations strategies. She also advises foreign corporations on commercial and regulatory issues in the United States.[1]
Barshefsky has written and lectured extensively on both U.S. and foreign trade laws and public procurement regimes. She was a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. She previously served as Vice Chair of the International Law Section of the American Bar Association as well as a member of its governing council and chair of its Publications Committee.
Personal life[edit]
Outside of her legal practice, Ambassador Barshefsky participates in several professional organizations; she is a board member of the America-China Society, a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Trilateral Commission. She also serves on the boards of Intel, American Express, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Estée Lauder, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[1] She also sits on the advisory board for America Abroad Media.[3]
Barshefsky lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband. They have two daughters.

Charlene Barshefsky (A):
Set between 1994 and 1996, this 16-page factual case study describes the challenges former United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky faced in negotiating a trade agreement with China to improve its domestic intellectual property rights enforcement regime. After briefly describing Barshefsky’s past experience and trade negotiations, this case discusses the history of U.S.-China trade relations and analyzes Ambassador Barshefsky’s strategy in coalition-building in the United States and abroad toward the goal of achieving a sustainable deal. As a result of her work in this context, Ambassador Barshefsky received the 2001 Program on Negotiation “Great Negotiator” Award.
 
Charlene Barshefsky (B): 
Also set between 1994 and 1996, this 17-page factual case study details former United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky’s strategic and tactical approach to surmounting the barriers laid out in the (A) case.
Both Charlene Barshefsky (A) and Charlene Barshefsky (B) are designed to help students examine complex negotiation and coalition building strategies in an international context. They explore national/ cultural negotiating styles, barriers to doing a deal amidst splintered commercial and political interests, and innovative approaches to surmounting those barriers. The two case studies are related, but may either be used together or separately.

Soft copy vs. hard copy
You may order this role simulation in either soft copy (electronic) or hard copy (paper) format. If you select the soft copy option, you will receive an e-mail with a URL (website address) from which you may download an electronic file in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. You are then permitted to view the document on your computer and either print the number of copies you purchased, or forward the electronic file as many times as the number of copies you purchased. You will only receive a link to one electronic file per document. So, if you order 25 soft copies, you may either forward copies of the link to 25 people via e-mail, or print (and/or photocopy) 25 hard copies of the document.
If you select the hard copy option, you will receive paper copies of this role simulation via the shipping method you select.
The purchase price and handling fee are the same for both soft and hard copies. Soft copies do not entail a shipping fee.
For additional information about the soft copy option, please visit our FAQ section, or contact the PON Teaching Negotiation Resource Center at tnrc@law.harvard.edu or 800-258-4406 (within the U.S.) or 781-966-2751 (outside the U.S.).
Please note: At the present time, Teaching Negotiation Resource Center soft copies are compatible with the following versions of the Adobe Acrobat Reader: English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean. If you have a different version of the Acrobat Reader, you may wish to download one of these at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html, or contact the PON Teaching Negotiation Resource Center at tnrc@law.harvard.edu, 800-258-4406 (within the U.S.), or 781-966-2751 (outside the U.S.) for further assistance. This restriction does not apply to the freely available Teacher’s Package Review Copies.
Ordering a single copy for review
If you wish to review the materials for a particular role simulation to decide whether you’d like to use it, then you should order a single Teacher’s Package for that role simulation. A PDF, or soft copy, version of the Teacher’s Package is also available as a free download from the description page of most role simulations and case studies. There is no need to order participant materials as well as a Teacher’s Package, as all Teacher’s Packages include copies of all participant materials. In addition, some Teacher’s Packages (but not all) include additional teaching materials such as teaching notes or overhead masters. Please note that the materials in Teacher’s Packages are for the instructor’s review and reference only, and may not be duplicated for use with participants.
Ordering copies for multiple participants
If you wish to order multiple copies of a role simulation for use in a course or workshop, simply enter the total number of participants in the box next to “Participant Copies.” There is no need to calculate how many of each role is required; the Teaching Negotiation Resource Center will calculate the appropriate numbers of each role to provide, based on the total number of participants. For example, if you wish to order a 2-party role simulation for use with a class of 30 students, you would enter “30” in the box next to “Participant Copies.” You then would receive 15 copies of one role and 15 copies of the other role, for use with your 30 participants. As another example, if you ordered 30 participant copies of a 6-party role simulation, you would receive 5 copies of each role.
In the event that the number of participant copies you order is not evenly divisible by the number of roles in the simulation, you will receive extra copies of one or more roles. Participants receiving the extra roles may partner with other participants playing the same role, thus negotiating as a team. So, for instance, if you ordered 31 copies of a 2-party role simulation, you would receive 15 copies of the first role and 16 copies of the second role. One of the participants playing the second role would partner with another participant playing that same role, and the two would negotiate as a team.

Charlene Barshefsky






Senior International Partner, WilmerHale Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, Senior International Partner at WilmerHale in Washington, DC, advises multinational corporations on their market access, investment and acquisition strategies across the globe. She has long been renowned in the US and around the world for her negotiating, policy and legal skills in transactions with governments, state-owned enterprises and private parties. She joined WilmerHale after serving as the United States Trade Representative from 1997 to 2001 and acting and deputy USTR from 1993 to 1996.
As the USTR and a member of the President's Cabinet, Ambassador Barshefsky was responsible for the formulation of US trade policy and the negotiation of hundreds of complex trade and investment agreements that significantly opened markets, removed regulatory barriers, and cemented protections for US investment from Europe to Asia, Africa to Latin America, and the Middle East. She also led the negotiation of global agreements to open the financial services and telecommunications sectors, remove global tariffs on information technology products, and protect intellectual property rights.
Ambassador Barshefsky is best known globally as the architect and negotiator of China's WTO agreement, which opened China's economy as a worldwide market. This agreement, of undisputed historical importance, has helped to reshape the global economic landscape. Her agreement to open the Vietnamese market was the cornerstone of the normalization of relations between the US and Vietnam; and her pursuit of pro-growth trade policies in the Middle East -through the initial creation of special economic zones to integrate Israel with her neighbors, and a Free Trade Agreement with Jordan - has been recognized as a foundation element for subsequent free trade initiatives with the Muslim Middle East.
A renowned figure among governments and policymakers around the world and in the legal profession, and long at center stage in the development of international trade policy, Ambassador Barshefsky has been honored by both Harvard and Yale law schools. Her negotiations are the subject of several Harvard Business School case studies; and her negotiating skills and legal talent have been heavily profiled in a large number of books, magazines and newspapers. She is a frequent lecturer and op-ed contributor in the US and abroad on trade and economic issues of importance, and is the recipient of a number of honorary degrees and numerous other accolades for lifetime achievement. She is recognized as one of the decade's most influential lawyers in the United States, and is a member of a broad range of foreign policy-oriented and economic institutions devoted to public policy and international relations.
Ambassador Barshefsky serves on the Boards of Directors of the American Express Company, the Estee Lauder Companies, Intel Corporation, and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. She is a Trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and is a Member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

BARSHEFSKY ON WTO MINISTERIAL


UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT: BARSHEFSKY ON WTO MINISTERIAL (ITA accord equivalent to billion
dollar world tax cut), December 16, 1996 

Singapore -- Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says that the
"landmark" agreement to eliminate tariffs on hundreds of global information
technology products is equivalent to a global tax cut totaling thousands of millions of
dollars. 
The Information Technology Agreement (ITA), concluded at the first ministerial meeting
of the World Trade Organization that concluded in Singapore December 13, will go into
effect once countries representing 90 percent of world trade in the products covered under
the accord sign the pact. Currently, 28 countries representing 84 percent of global trade
in information technology products have committed to the ITA, Barshefsky said. 
"There is absolutely no question that implementation will begin in 1997," she
said in a press conference here December 13 following the ministerial conference. 
Barshefsky also expressed satisfaction that ministers gave the go-ahead to the WTO to
begin studies of transparency in government procurement, investment and competition
policies. 
Barshefsky said that good progress had been made at the WTO meeting on advancing
negotiations in basic telecommunications services and on reaffirming Uruguay Round
commitments to move forward with negotiations on agricultural sector liberalization in
1999. 
She also commented on the mention of labor issues in the WTO declaration and the
importance of collaboration between the WTO and the International Labor Organization in
assuring continued public support for trade agreements negotiations. 
Following is an unofficial transcript of the Barshefsky briefing: 
(begin transcript) 
Let me say that I have been looking forward to this press conference because this is
the first time I have sat down in five days. Let me first introduce the people who are up
here, my deputy Jeff Lane, our chief ITA negotiators Dorothy Dwoskin and Andy Stoler. Andy
also is our number two in our Geneva office. There are many other people whose names I
would like to go through, Matt Rohde and Barbara Chattin, Clayton Parker, Margaret
Sullivan, and, I apologize, but any one of a number of people who have been working just
day and night to bring the ITA to fruition. But of all, I particularly want to single out
Dorothy Dwoskin for her tireless, absolutely tireless efforts. 
Let me also begin by thanking the Singapore Government, and in particular Minister Yeo,
who with very deft handling was able to bring to conclusion a ministerial declaration that
dealt with many subjects formally of contention among the ministerial participants,
whether on agriculture or textiles, competition policy, labor standards, investment. All
these issues presented complexity and his very able skillful handling of these matters is
what helped bring the ministerial declaration to conclusion. Also Director-General
Ruggiero, who helped put everything together, the ministerial declaration as well as his
assistance with respect to the ITA. 
I would also before I begin, thank all of the countries who worked so hard with the
United States to reach what really is a landmark agreement with respect to information
technology. 
Just a short while ago, President Clinton phoned, and he expressed has delight with the
outcome of the ministerial and also his personal gratitude to the many countries that
participated. In particular, he wanted me to express his gratitude to the APEC nations
which contributed. As you know, the President was very forceful at the APEC meetings in
Manila with respect to the need for APEC leaders to endorse and work toward conclusion of
an ITA by the Singapore Ministerial. That goal having been achieved, the President wanted
me particularly to thank his APEC colleagues for this achievement. 
The Information Technology Agreement, which was achieved, will eliminate to zero
tariffs on hundreds of global information technology products, whether semi-conductors or
telecommunications equipment, computers, computer equipment, software, a huge gamut of
products. Product coverage at present represents five hundred billion dollars, one half
trillion dollars, in global trade. That is based on 1995 figures, so the half trillion
figure is quite understated relative to what we knew was a significant important in trade
in these products in 1996. 
The movement to zero by the year 2000 in all of these products really constitutes a
global tax cut. It means that the creation of the information superhighway will he
encouraged and promoted, not taxed. It means that countries, which produce and export
these products will gain not only from tariff productions, which are very significant, but
also with respect to what we know happens when tariffs are reduced. 
We know from 50 years of GATT experience, you reduce tariffs, trade increases
exponentially, and that is exactly what will happen here. So we have not only the savings
from a global tax cut, which for U.S. industries, based on last year's figures, would have
totalled over up a billion dollars, but you have, in addition, the spur of a very rapidly
increased trade volumes and trade values in these products. 
Countries that participate in the agreement will eliminate tariffs on IT products by
the year 2000 on a maximum range of product coverage. In a very few limited cases, and
this is spelled out with quite particularity, in limited cases, it may take a few more
years beyond the year 2000 to get to zero tariffs. And, of course, the United States
position in Geneva, for months and months, has been absolutely that flexibility needs to
be built into the agreement on IT products because, of course, we are dealing with
economies that are both very developed but also much less developed, but the exception
from zero by the year 2000 are explicitly "limited". 
Let me talk a minute about the schedule that is set out in the documents that you will
review, if I can find my schedule. If you'll bear with me for one moment. It was right
here. O.K. This is all spelled out in the documents that you will see. 13 December, 1996
is our ministerial declaration. It specifies the countries that have already, and the
document is about 23 pages long, that have already committed to the ITA. 
Let me read you the list of countries. It is 28 countries representing 84 percent of
global trade in IT products. Those countries are Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, the
European Communities -- that is the EC fifteen-- Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan,
Korea, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. 
Apart from these 28 countries, three additional countries have told us, and have issued
letters of intent today, which you will see, that they intend fully to participate in what
is going to be a short Geneva process, and I will take you through the schedule, and to
participate in the ITA that will bring total global product coverage, I'm sorry, total
trade volume coverage to 94 percent. Our threshold for automatic implementation of the
agreement is 90 percent, or approximately 90 percent, of global trade coverage. With the
84 percent commitments today, (and) what will be an additional nine percent within the
next week or two, there is no question this agreement is a full go ahead. There is
absolutely no question that implementation will begin in 1997. 
Let me then go through the chronology for you as to what happens now. 13 December is
today. That's the ministerial declaration, copies of which will be available when the copy
machines can churn them out. 31 January, 1997, so at the end of January, technical
discussions in Geneva must be completed. The technical discussions revolve around the
staging out of the tariffs between now and the year 2000. The agreement specifies that
tariffs will be cut one quarter, one quarter, one quarter, one quarter, the first tranche
beginning July, 1997, and ending in January, 2000. But the agreement also specifies that
all of that may be accelerated for countries which wish to do so, and the agreement
specifies that there is some alternative form of staging provided you get to zero in 2000.
That's acceptable as well. 
I've had extensive discussions with the European Union over the last three days, and
will have further discussions in Geneva. It would be our hope that, at a minimum, we and
the European Union would accelerate our tariff cuts. We would not wait to the year 2000 to
go to zero, but those discussions will happen in Geneva. Then on March 1, 1997, this is
the deadline for submitting all of the staging cuts which have been agreed. So all the
technical details are then formally submitted in document form. On April 1, 1997, that is
the deadline for all the countries to review everything that has been submitted, and to
determine whether two criteria have been met for the automatic implementation of the ITA
beginning in July. 
Criterion number one: Do we have approximately 90 percent of global trade in IT
products covered? We're already there. We know that is going to be a yes. Number two: Are
all countries satisfied with the staging commitments that have been made, that is the way
the tariffs will be cut to get to zero. I have absolute confidence the answer to that will
be yes as well. 
Then July 1, 1997, is the deadline for tariff bindings. One of the important points of
this agreement is all the tariff cuts will be bound. They cannot be raised again. This is
very significant, particularly in the developing world, where many tariffs are not bound
firmly but can float within a range. These tariffs are all bound. July 1, 1997, is the
deadline for tariff binding and the first tariff cut. 
January 1, 1998, deadline for second tariff cut. January 1, 1999, the deadline for the
third January 1, 2000, deadline for the final cut, that's zero. In the limited
circumstance in which additional time is needed on specified products that will have
already been spelled out in the schedules and agreed to, as part of the two criterion that
have to be satisfied, and then those cuts will proceed. However, it has been agreed they
will be staged. All this has been spelled out and is agreed to already formally by 84
percent of world trade in these products with the other nine percent coming on board
before we begin our process in Geneva in several weeks. 
Now, let me say simply that in the United States about 1.8 million jobs are hinged to
high technology products, and in the last four years alone, even though the U.S. faces
very substantial tariff barriers around the world to these products, U.S. exports in these
products has increased 42 percent. 
Imagine the rate of increase when tariffs are at zero. Let me give you a few examples.
In countries like Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, tariffs are as much as six times
those in the United States on a variety of products. In semiconductors in Europe, for
example, some tariffs are as high an 14 percent. U.S. is at zero. So the benefits of the
agreement certainly for the United States will be substantial, but the benefits for Asia,
for Europe and other countries will be equally substantial. 
As a final point, let me say that the ITA agreement delivers on the focus of the
President with respect: first, to the importance of the multilateral system as an on-going
vehicle for trade liberalization; second, the importance of Asia to the United States
economy; and third, the importance of market access as a means to foster our own domestic
economic prosperity as well as a means to foster global growth. 
I would repeat again that but for the President's accomplishments at the Manila
leaders' meeting with respect to the ITA commitment by the Asian nations there would have
been no possible way to have this agreement emerge here at Singapore. 
Now let me spend just one moment on the Singapore declaration, which is the first
declaration, of course, that's come out of the meeting. It is the other document that you
will see today, with regard to the issues in that declaration, the United States is very
pleased. We think a very good balance has been achieved in the document, and the aims that
we sat out to accomplish by and large I think we have achieved. 
On procurement, transparency in government procurement, there is agreed that there will
be a study which will explicitly lead to an agreement on transparency in government
procurement. This was a principal United States objective because access to government
procurement markets worldwide is terribly limited, and we know many of those markets are
characterized by substantial bribery and corruption. The greater the transparency, the
greater the due process in government purchasing, the better chance the United States and
other countries have to compete on a level playing field. 
Second, with respect to labor rights, since the Eisenhower Administration, the United
states has sought a framework from which we can pursue our labor objective in the context
of global trade. We are talking about core labor standards, as you know, as enunciated by
the ILO and by the UN. This is an area where the interests, the underlying interests, of
developed and developing economies are the same, and this was very clear from the
discussions that were held. As you may know, the core labor standards issue dominated
three days of discussions among the ministers. The interesting thing was that for all the
parties present the commitment to observing core labor standards, the commitment to
increasing prosperity and social welfare, is unquestioned and viewed by the developing
world, an well as the developed world, as an unquestioned series of principles, so that
has never been in doubt. 
For the United States, the debate has never been about protectionism, on the one hand,
or barriers, on the other. It has been to achieve an enunciated consensus on the critical
importance of worker welfare and the critical importance of striving to maximize worker
welfare as we do trade agreements. 
As you see from the ministerial declaration, or you will, we have achieved explicit
reference to core labor standards and commitments to core labor standards. In the 50 years
of GATT, we were never able to do that. And in addition, the document notes that there
will continue to be an existing collaboration between the WTO Secretariat and the ILO
Secretariat, which coordinate already on many issues. 
The declaration also makes plain principles with which the United States absolutely
agrees: that labor standards should not be used for protectionist purposes and that
genuine comparative advantage of lower wage countries should not be undermined. 
I'd make one additional note. That in the chairman's summing up statement additional
comments were made with respective to the subject pertaining to the WTO agenda and
likewise. In the heads of delegation plenary, which was held immediately before the
closing session, the chairman made clear, upon reading the same statement, that his
statement was his own, there was no consensus on his statement, that the legal consensus
and binding consensus is that which appears in the ministerial declaration. We think that
this is very important and needs to be noted. 
In basic telecommunications, very good progress was made this week in advancing the
negotiations on basic telecom. Reed Hundt, the chairman of our Federal Communications
Commission, and I co-hosted a meeting on Monday (December 9) with a number of delegations
interested in the global talks on telecommunications services liberalization. We expected
perhaps 10 or 12 delegations. We had 32 delegations, virtually all of which represented
ministerial level. There was an increasing amount of interest in these talks. Some
countries indicated their offers would improve. We encourage that. We hope the ITA
agreement will lead toward improvement in those telecom offers, after all the IT agreement
are the cars and the trucks on the road, but the telecom agreement is the road. So, we
hope the ITA agreement will lead to better offers in the telecom area. Certainly, as you
all know, as we have said repeatedly, the United States must see -- must see, improved
offers from a variety of nations if the talks are successfully conclude on February 15. 
On the subject of agriculture, one of the key issues was to look at the implementation
of Uruguay Round commitments. For the United States, this is particularly important with
respect to agriculture. The ministerial declaration says that the reform process will
continue, that we will remain true to the timeframes set out in Marrakesh, which means
negotiations begin in 1999, which means the preparatory work will be completed by 1999 for
those negotiations. This is very good news for U.S. agriculture. But, let me say, U.S.
agriculture faces serious impediments around the world. Import barriers, state trading
enterprises, export subsidies, unjustifiable and non-scientific sanitary and
phyto-sanitary regulations hamper U.S. exports. The outcome of the ministerial gives us an
opportunity to attack these problems head-on, but these problems most be resolved. Let me
say that with respect to agriculture, there was a very large U.S. agriculture delegation
that came here at considerable sacrifice, and we are very grateful for the work that they
did. 
On investment, the U.S. goal had been a modest work program which would not interfere
with completion of investment negotiations on-going now in the OECD. That aim has been
accomplished. 
With respect to competition policy, we have ensured that work on competition will not
threaten our laws which protect principles of fair pricing and fair competition. The work
plan is expected to focus on the problems of cartels and other private, anti-competitive
behavior which can impede foreign market access. 
All in all, I apologize for the length of this explanation, but all in all, the United
States is very pleased with the outcome of the first ministerial conference, as well as
with the outcome of the ITA negotiations. We look forward to continuing a leadership role
in the WTO, and we look forward particularly working in Geneva toward the implementation
of the ITA agreement, July of 1997. With that, let me please invite questions. 
QUESTION: It has been a long stated goal of the Clinton administration that trade
agreements have to be a two-way street. How does that philosophy jell with the ITA and its
application to China? Are you extending these deals to China on an MFN basis without China
making commitments, or how do you expect to handle that issue? 
ANSWER: First, let me say that, as in any tariff negotiation, you want a critical mass
of those countries who are the major producers and exporters so that you avoid free
riders. This is why we set a very high threshold on the kick-in for the ITA. We have
already achieved it, but the threshold will be approximately 90 percent of global trade
covered. This is, of course, as you know, an agreement within the WTO, and we will
certainly look at the question of its application to China as we proceed. 
Q: There is no decision yet on China? 
A: We will look at that as we proceed. 
Q: There was so much agreement and unanimity in observing core labor standards and the
ILO convention. Why were three days spent on just negotiating words to be put into the
declaration? 
A: I think that's a very good question, because, as you know, the question is: What is
the proper role of the WTO as a trade institution with respect to the issue of core
standards or, more broadly, worker welfare? This is a complex debate. For some countries,
the link is obvious and apparent. For other countries, a linkage is to be avoided between
WTO or trade agreements, on the one hand, and worker issues, on the other. That is the
ideological debate, and the text attempts to reconcile the ideological debate by putting
forward principles with which we can all agree. No one wants to use labor standards for
protectionist purposes, and if there is a genuine comparative advantage in the developing
world, no one wishes to put into question that genuine comparative advantage. But by the
same token, it is acknowledged well the ILO and WTO do work together. That is the fact. It
is current reality, and the importance of the declaration is the explicit indication of
the continuing collaboration that will occur in the future. But the ideological debate is,
as I have described. As a practical matter, as a practical, political matter, the issue is
really not very far apart. The WTO is committed to trade liberalization through trade
agreements negotiation. If working people, whether in the United States, or the European
Union, or in Indonesia, or Brazil, or Argentina, or Mexico, or Russia, if working people
believe trade agreements threaten their jobs, if working people believe trade agreements
lead to workers dislocation, there will be an erosion in the constituency for trade
agreement and trade liberalization, and the foundation and existence of the WTO itself
will be threatened. As a practical matter, if working people don't believe these
agreements are in their interests, politicians who are elected by working people won't be
able to negotiate them, and that threatens the free trading system. 
We, therefore, must as a practical matter, ideology aside, recognize that issues of
worker welfare and worker rights are absolutely a part of the trade agreements debate,
whether ideologically one is happy about that or not. 
Q: Just a technical clarification on ITA. You may have misspoken, or I may have
misheard you. Before you said three additional countries have today told us...that will
bring the total coverage to 94 percent. Your press release says six other countries bring
it from 85 to 91 percent. What other countries? 
A: I do apologize. Three are Asian countries. Three are not. I apologize. It is six. We
are correct in our release, and I misspoke. We have the 28 countries that are listed. That
is the 84 percent. Six additional countries -- three Asian, three non-Asian -- have
already provided their intent to actively participate in Geneva and to join in the ITA.
For these countries, by and large, the problem had to do with not enough time to really go
through the product coverage scope. They just needed more time. That will then increase
the coverage to above the trigger threshold. 
Q: Above 90 percent? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Above 94 percent? 
A: Whatever the number was in the release. 
Q: The number would be just over 90? 
A: I thought the number was 94. I thought that was the secretariat number, but let me
ask Dorothy (Dwoskin). 
Q: What Dorothy is saying is (it is) safest to say "just above 90" because
the data are preliminary but, as the secretariat worked out the data, their initial
projection was 94 percent. In any event, we will be above the threshold, whether it is
just above 90 or 94 percent, we will be above the threshold. 
A: Let me make one comment on the product coverage. You will receive a 14-page product
coverage document. That has been agreed. This is the summary. The 14-page single space
document is the summary of the product coverage. Were we to go through the products, the
sub-products and the sub-sub-products, you'd be looking at a massive, massive, massive
document. So this was the summary, which we thought would be the easiest and, in terms of
copying, the cheapest thing we could provide. 
Q: If I am not mistaken, I think you said that the study with regard to competition
should not threaten our roles, you said. Do you include in those roles say legislation on
anti-dumping? 
A: Oh, no question. There's no question that from the point of view of the United
States and, indeed, also the European Union the anti-dumping laws are not on the table. No
question about that. 
Q: Is that the understanding at this ministerial meeting is undertaking this study on
competition and investments? 
A: The study on competition is intended to focus on competition policy (anti-trust) --
in other words, anti-competitive practices that would impede market access, private
anti-competitive practices largely. 
Q: Oh, yes, it's to my surprise, but I just wanted to have confirmation. 
Q: Given your remarks about the importance of Asian countries in securing a deal on the
ITA, would the U.S. be sympathetic to looking at an Asian candidate as a successor to
Renato Ruggiero? 
A: I don't want to respond to that. Renato Ruggiero has...is it two years left on his
term, 1999? So come ask me in 1999. 
Q: As part of this collaboration between the ILO and the WTO, would you see the WTO as
promoting, endorsing, enforcing core labor standards? Secondly, Sir Leon Brittan has been
talking about this millennium round that he wants to launch by the year 2000. After this
meeting in Singapore, are you convinced that such an inter-sectoral round is necessary?
You know, a global comprehensive world trade round. 
A: With respect to your first question, plainly, labor standards are set in the ILO.
There is no desire on the part of any WTO member, including the United States, to set or
define labor standards in the WTO. So there's no question about that. With respect to the
notion of a global round, there really has been virtually no discussion. One of the goals
of the United States -- and perhaps an over-arching goal of the United States in this
ministerial meeting -- was to establish the principle that the WTO was in many ways
fundamentally different from the GATT system. One, that the WTO would be a forum in which
members, trade concerns could be discussed -- whether it is this core labor standards
issue, or agriculture, or competition policy, any one of a number of issues. That
principle has been established. This is a forum in which ideas and discussion even of
controversial issues can take place. Number two: of principal importance to the United
States was to establish the fact that major trade liberalization could occur through the
WTO without having to call for a global round, without having to wait for a global round.
Because if we had to wait for a global round for the next bit of liberalization, the world
would be waiting perhaps until well after the turn of the century, and then if the Uruguay
Round in a guide, they would wait another eight years after that. We wanted to establish
the notion that we could proceed a pace with market opening, with trade growth on an
absolutely routine basis. The ITA establishes that principle. Both of those goals were
very important to the United States and to many other countries here, and I think the WTO
will be strengthened for those goals having been achieved. Thank you very, very much.

Charlene Barshefsky Interview | Wide Angle
China’s membership in the World Trade Organization received strong disapproval from those critical of its poor human rights record. However, China was still able to garner support, most notably from the United States. Charlene Barshefsky, U.S. Trade Representative in the Clinton administration, was the chief negotiator propelling China’s entry into the WTO. In this video segment from the Wide Angle film "To Have and Have Not," Barshefsky discusses how the people of China may benefit from its inclusion in the WTO.

Background Essay
                    



Print
                    




Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, a former U.S. Trade Representative for the Clinton administration, discusses her views on economic change in China. She believes that economic engagement with the west will lead China to greater political pluralism.Since the late 1970s, China has shifted from a centrally planned economy that was largely closed to international trade to a more market-oriented economy that has a rapidly growing private sector and is a major player in the global economy. Reforms began in the agricultural, industrial, and financial sectors, and labor regulations were relaxed. The government also focused on foreign trade as a major vehicle for economic growth, and to encourage foreign investment, China created special economic zones in coastal cities. As the result of adopting economic reforms and joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001, China's per capita income has grown at an average annual rate of more than 8% over the last three decades. While poverty has been drastically reduced, this rapid growth has been accompanied by rising income inequalities, especially between rural and urban areas.One specific change China has been forced to embrace as a result of joining the WTO is to liberalize the movement of labor within the country. During the Maoist era of the 1950s, China instituted an inherited residency permit system that defined where its citizens could work. This system, or "hukou," made it extremely difficult for rural residents to leave their hometowns and move to cities to work. Restructuring the hukou system has been a very controversial topic even though many Community Party leaders recognize it is an impediment to economic progress. The system still exists, but enforcement of the residency permits has been relaxed in recent years. By the early 21st century an estimated 200 million Chinese lived outside their officially-registered areas. While it is easier for these migrants to work in cities than ever before, they are still unofficial residents of the cities and as a result have very limited access to education and government services. Many are forced to live a precarious existence in company dormitories or shanty towns, and in several respects occupy a social and economic status similar to illegal immigrants. The Wide Angle film "To Have and Have Not" explores the human side of China's newly liberalized market economy. In the film, the increasing income gap between rich and poor is highlighted in vivid detail. The gated communities, luxury vehicles, and seemingly boundless consumption of China's newly rich is seen in stark contrast to the plight of migrant workers, who struggle to eke out a living and to educate their children at the margins of urban society. 








Discussion Questions
                    



Print
                    




What is Charlene Barshefsky's position on the relationship between political openness in China and economic engagement with the West? At the beginning of the segment Daljit Dhaliwal says, "We know that China has an appalling human rights record." What might be some of the human costs of rapid economic growth in China? China is currently experiencing rapid economic and political change. What other examples of rapidly transforming economies and societies can you name from your knowledge of world history? What elements do these examples have in common with the current situation in China? How might they differ?

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Barshefsky was raised in a Jewish family on the North Side of Chicago, to Gustave, a Polish immigrant and chemical engineer, who died in 1995, and Miriam, a Russian immigrant and retired substitute teacher.[2] She has one brother, Alvin Barshefsky, and one sister, Annette Weinshank.[2] In 1968, Barshefsky graduated from Von Steuben High School.[2] In 1972, Barshefsky graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor's degree double majoring in English and Political Science. In 1975, she earned her J.D. from the Columbus School of Law of The Catholic University of America.
Barshefsky was nominated by former President Bill Clinton to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative along with Rufus Yerxa and Richard W. Fisher. In 1999 she was the primary negotiator with China's Zhu Rongji, laying out the terms for China's eventual entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Her negotiations have been analyzed in Harvard Business School case studies.[1]
Legal practice[edit]
As of June 2012, Barshefsky is a Senior International Partner at WilmerHale. Her legal practice focuses on international business transactions, commercial agreements, and regulatory impediments to exporting and investment. Specifically, her expertise lies in "crafting market penetration strategies for goods, services, and investment and devising practical solutions to market access barriers". Her clients include Fortune 100 and other multinational companies that services like trade litigation, dispute resolution, and government relations strategies. She also advises foreign corporations on commercial and regulatory issues in the United States.[1]
Barshefsky has written and lectured extensively on both U.S. and foreign trade laws and public procurement regimes. She was a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. She previously served as Vice Chair of the International Law Section of the American Bar Association as well as a member of its governing council and chair of its Publications Committee.
Personal life[edit]
Outside of her legal practice, Ambassador Barshefsky participates in several professional organizations; she is a board member of the America-China Society, a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Trilateral Commission. She also serves on the boards of Intel, American Express, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Estée Lauder, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[1] She also sits on the advisory board for America Abroad Media.[3]
Barshefsky lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband. They have two daughters.

Early life, education, and career[edit]
Barshefsky was raised in a Jewish family on the North Side of Chicago, to Gustave, a Polish immigrant and chemical engineer, who died in 1995, and Miriam, a Russian immigrant and retired substitute teacher.[2] She has one brother, Alvin Barshefsky, and one sister, Annette Weinshank.[2] In 1968, Barshefsky graduated from Von Steuben High School.[2] In 1972, Barshefsky graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a bachelor's degree double majoring in English and Political Science. In 1975, she earned her J.D. from the Columbus School of Law of The Catholic University of America.
Barshefsky was nominated by former President Bill Clinton to serve as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative along with Rufus Yerxa and Richard W. Fisher. In 1999 she was the primary negotiator with China's Zhu Rongji, laying out the terms for China's eventual entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. Her negotiations have been analyzed in Harvard Business School case studies.[1]
Legal practice[edit]
As of June 2012, Barshefsky is a Senior International Partner at WilmerHale. Her legal practice focuses on international business transactions, commercial agreements, and regulatory impediments to exporting and investment. Specifically, her expertise lies in "crafting market penetration strategies for goods, services, and investment and devising practical solutions to market access barriers". Her clients include Fortune 100 and other multinational companies that services like trade litigation, dispute resolution, and government relations strategies. She also advises foreign corporations on commercial and regulatory issues in the United States.[1]
Barshefsky has written and lectured extensively on both U.S. and foreign trade laws and public procurement regimes. She was a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. She previously served as Vice Chair of the International Law Section of the American Bar Association as well as a member of its governing council and chair of its Publications Committee.
Personal life[edit]
Outside of her legal practice, Ambassador Barshefsky participates in several professional organizations; she is a board member of the America-China Society, a fellow of the Foreign Policy Association, and a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Trilateral Commission. She also serves on the boards of Intel, American Express, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Estée Lauder, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[1] She also sits on the advisory board for America Abroad Media.[3]
Barshefsky lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband. They have two daughters.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
