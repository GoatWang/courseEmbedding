Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

United Kingdom

DIAM International is the London based asset management business of the DIAM Group, headquartered in Tokyo, with over USD 146 billion AUM (as of 30th September 2014) worldwide. DIAM International have been servicing their clients in EMEA for over 30 years, including public and private sector pension funds, financial institutions and large institutional investors.  The success of the DIAM Group stems from the range of unconstrained, active, quant and index equity strategies they offer, which include Global, Global Emerging Markets, Japan, Asia and Europe as well as fixed income and alternative solutions.In order to meet GIPS® requirements and establish an automated solution for monthly performance and reporting, VPD Composites, part of VPD Risk & Performance, was chosen. This would import data direct from SimCorp Dimension, perform reconciliations and calculations, and using the VPD Web Portal, distribute results to teams across DIAM International.Jan Weber, Chief Financial Officer at DIAM International commented: "Following an extensive search, we migrated to VPD for our GIPS® solution as it was a modern, robust and flexible Composite management tool that interfaced well with our existing systems. It is fully automated so will also produce our suite of monthly performance reports. As VPD Composites is a core VPD product, we are confident that we have selected a future-proofed solution which will adapt to our needs."The implementation began in September 2014 and VPD Composites went into production November 2014.“VPD has worked with DIAM International for many years and I am delighted they have chosen VPD Composites as their GIPS® management and performance reporting solution. Our project team was able to convert from their existing system to VPD Composites swiftly, and as with all solutions that are part of VPD Risk & Performance, we have interfaced with the existing data sources at DIAM International to deliver a seamless process.  I am very proud that DIAM International have already gone live with the solution, and I value our on-going partnership”, says Johan Lundman, Managing Director at VPD Financial Software Consulting Ltd.
