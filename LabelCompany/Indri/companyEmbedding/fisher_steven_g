Steve Fisher  
United States



video channelsphoto albumsnewsbiography



Hailing from Bloomington, MN, Steven G. (Steve) Fisher is an accomplished drummer/percussionist and a well-known figure in the field of electronic percussion. Steve Fisher has held a variety of positions in his 20+ years at Roland, but currently serves as Product Marketing Manager Drums & Percussion Products for Roland US. He is also a long-standing member of the Percussion Research and Development Team for parent company Roland Japan. And if that wasn't enough, Steve is also a sought-after clinician and demonstrator - not only in the United States but internationally as different Roland families around the world invite him to demonstrate Roland products at their music shows and festivals. Steve Fisher credits his very supportive parents and the music programs at his school with helping him develop his talents. "My high school band director, Dr. Earl Benson, was one of the key people that encouraged and helped me with pursuing a career in music." Perhaps that's why from a very early age Steve Fisher knew he wanted to attend North Texas State University, which he eventually did. While performing with the prestigious 1 O'clock Jazz Band during his senior year, Steve Fisher was picked up by jazz great Maynard Ferguson. "I was on the band when he made his transition to his 'electronic band' format. It was at that time that I realized that although guitar and keyboard players had their electronic counter-parts to their acoustic instruments, drum set players didnt. I used electronic pads and drum machines, but there was yet to be a fully-functioning electronic drum set." During this time of his life, Steve Fisher had the opportunity to travel with several other artists as well, eventually leading him to move to Los Angeles where he started recording on albums, jingles and movie soundtracks. It became one of his most treasured accomplishments, and it ultimately led him to where he is today. In the late 1980s Steve had been invited by Roland to work at one of their national trade shows and it was at this show that Steve was first introduced to Mr. Ikutaro Kakehashi, the founder of Roland. After a discussion about the current and future of electronic percussion products, Steve was invited to visit Mr. Kakehashi in Japan and assist with the creation of the world's first-ever electronic drum set, the TDE-7K. This is what started it all for Steve and Roland: he joined Roland USA. full time and continued to work with Roland Japan on the research and development of new products, including the Roland V-Drums.

Soap Sticks for Oilfield
    


Soap Sticks for Oilfield made by Fisher Stevens contain surfactant in 
              a solid stick form and are specially formulated as brine and brine/condensate 
              foamers and friction reducers for both salt and fresh water producing 
              gas wells. Another application is as a pressure reducer in water 
              disposal systems.
The primary application of the Soap Sticks is to foam the water 
              in gas wells, which are loaded up. This increases the flow rate 
              of the well by lowering the hydrostatic head on the formation. The 
              foaming of the water, combined with the increased flow rate, allows 
              the well to unload the fluid, achieving a higher rate of production. 
              The foaming action will often clean the well bore of deposits, which 
              build up.
Soap Sticks are most effective by dropping them in the well when 
              the flow rate begins decreasing. The agitation of the gas flow through 
              the water facilitates the foaming of the water when the stick is 
              dropped. If a well is dead, Soap Sticks are effective when used 
              in combination with swabbing the well. The foaming action assists 
              in the removal of the fluid by keeping the fluid column lighter 
              while swabbing, helping to recover more fluid on each swab run. 
              The foaming fluid left in the well after swabbing combined with 
              gas flow from the zone can keep the well from loading up so quickly.
The soap stick will start dissolving immediately on contact with 
              the water in the well. With agitation, the stick will completely 
              dissolve in four to six hours. This dissolution rate will vary. Sticks will drop 
              approximately 100 feet per minute through solid water. This will 
              vary with the amount of gas which is passing though the fluid. The 
              Soap Stick is soluble in water and is insoluble in oil.
We recommend the use of one to three sticks in a well in any 
              one application. Every well is different in the way it will perform. 
              Experiment with the number of sticks used and the time of their 
              use to find the best combination for the individual well.
Directions: Remove Soap Stick from paper tube before dropping in 
              well. This may be done by peeling off paper tube or pushing soap 
              stick from the tube.


Soap Sticks For Enhanced Gas Well Production
    Surfactants in a solid stick are formulated as brine and brine/condensate foamers for both salt and fresh 
    water producing gas wells. The agitation of gas flow past the soap stick generates foam, which lightens 
    the column of water in the well. This allows the well to unload fluid, thus generating greater gas flow.
