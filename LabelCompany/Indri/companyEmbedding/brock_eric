Home  » by author, illustrator » A - B » Eric J. BrockISBN 9781565548701ERIC BROCK'S SHREVEPORTDescriptionAbout the AuthorDetailsReviewsToday, Shreveport boasts the largest collection of important twentieth-century buildings in the state of Louisiana, and is surpassed only by New Orleans in the number of locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Well-known Shreveport historian Eric J. Brock details the history of the city’s commerce, civic development, neighborhoods, architecture, cemeteries, peculiar events, culture, religion, and education. Based on his columns for the long-running weekly series, “The Presence of the Past,” which appeared weekly in the Shreveport Journal Page, it is the result of many years of documentation and research.
One can witness the breakup of the Great Raft, relive the yellow fever epidemic of 1873, sing along at the Louisiana Hayride, and retrace the steps of Martin Luther King, Jr. Written in response to an overwhelming number of requests and suggestions for a book of its kind, Eric Brock’s Shreveport should fill the void for academic books depicting the area.
About the Author
 Eric J. Brock is a lifelong resident of Shreveport and has written countless newspaper and magazine articles about the city’s history and other Louisiana subjects. He is active in historic preservation, and is a past and present board member for such organizations as the Historic Preservation of Shreveport, the Louisiana Preservation Alliance, the Highland Area Partnership of Shreveport, and the Oakland Cemetery Preservation Society of Shreveport.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
