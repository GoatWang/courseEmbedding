 One of our guiding principles is that we will communicate with our shareholders as candidly as possible because we believe shareholders benefit from understanding our corporate philosophy and approach. Our views and opinions regarding the prospects of the Company are "forward looking statements" which may or may not be accurate and may be materially different over future periods. Forward looking statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of such words as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update or alter any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated.

Letter from the President 


Welcome to Bexil Corporation!

Our objective is simple, straightforward, and sharply  focused: to increase book  value per share over time. We believe that long term stockholders will  benefit from a rising book value as market recognition builds and investors  come to appreciate Bexil's intrinsic value as well.  Having the value of  your investment in Bexil grow is as important to us as it is to you --  management and affiliates own over 30% of Bexil's shares.

We appreciate and thank you for your interest in Bexil. 





Sincerely, 




Thomas B. Winmill
President
