Exhibit 10.22
 
EXECUTION VERSION
 
MANAGEMENT SERVICES
AGREEMENT
 
 

This MANAGEMENT
SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of
October 25, 2013 (the “Effective Date”), is made by and
among NM Mariposa Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Holdings”), The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Neiman Marcus”), and ACOF Operating
Manager III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“Manager”).
 

WHEREAS, Holdings and
Neiman Marcus desire to obtain from Manager, and Manager desires to
provide certain management and financial services to Holdings and
its subsidiaries;

 

WHEREAS, Manager has
provided services to Holdings and Mariposa Merger Sub LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub”), in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of September 9, 2013 (the “Merger
Agreement”), by and among Holdings, Mariposa Merger Sub LLC
and Neiman Marcus Group LTD Inc., a Delaware corporation;
and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement, ACOF Operating Manager IV,
LLC and CPPIB Equity Investments Inc. are each entering into
separate management services agreements with Holdings and Neiman
Marcus on terms and conditions substantially identical to those
contained herein.

 

NOW THEREFORE, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
 








1.



Retention . Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, Holdings and Neiman Marcus hereby retain Manager
to provide certain agreed upon management and financial services to
Holdings and its subsidiaries during the term of this Agreement. No
minimum number of hours is required to be devoted by Manager on a
weekly, monthly, annual or other basis.



 








2.



Term . The term of this Agreement (the
“Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
terminate on the date upon which Holdings and Manager mutually
agree to terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, (a) the obligations to pay amounts due
pursuant to Section 3 hereof with respect to periods prior to the
termination hereof, and (b) the provisions of Sections 4
through 7 hereof, shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.



 








3.



Reimbursement of Expenses; Advisory
Fees .
Holdings and Neiman Marcus shall, jointly and severally, pay to, or
on behalf of, Manager, within 30 days of submission of itemized
expense statements and other documentation in accordance with
reasonable procedures specified by Neiman Marcus, all actual
out-of-pocket third party expenses (excluding allocation of
internal expenses) incurred by Manager or any Manager Related Party
(as defined below) (or



 



 

 
incurred on such Person’s
behalf by any other Persons) in connection with (a) the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (b) the
services provided hereunder. Such expenses shall include, among
other things, (x) any independent professionals and organizations,
including independent accountants, outside legal counsel and
consultants, (y) costs of any outside services and independent
contractors such as couriers, business publications, on-line
financial services and similar services and (z) transportation, per
diem costs, word processing expenses and any similar expenses (in
each case, to the extent they are out-of-pocket third party
expenses). In connection with (i) advisory services rendered by
Manager with respect to any merger, acquisition, recapitalization,
divestiture, financing, refinancing or other similar transaction in
which Holdings or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries may
be, or may consider becoming, involved or (ii) a termination of
this Agreement, subject to compliance with Section 4.07 of the
Stockholders Agreement, Holdings may agree that Holdings or Neiman
Marcus shall pay a fee to Manager in an amount to be mutually
agreed upon.
 








4.



Decisions/Authority of Management
Advisor .
Holdings and its subsidiaries shall make all decisions with regard
to any matter upon which Manager has rendered its advice and
consultation, and there shall be no liability to Manager or any
Manager Related Party for any such advice accepted or rejected by
Holdings or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement. For any services provided hereunder, or under any
other arrangement arising out of this Agreement, Manager and the
Manager Related Parties shall be acting solely as independent
contractors and not as agents of Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
creating a partnership, joint venture or similar relationship of
any kind, or an employee/employer relationship, between the parties
hereto (or any of their respective Related Persons). Manager shall
have no authority to enter into any agreement or to make any
representation, commitment or warranty binding upon Holdings or any
of its subsidiaries or to obtain or incur any right, obligation or
liability on behalf of Holdings or any of its subsidiaries. Manager
shall have complete charge of any of its personnel who render
advice and consultation to Holdings or any of its subsidiaries
under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or
construed to enlarge the fiduciary duties and responsibilities, if
any, of Manager or any Manager Related Party, including in any of
their respective capacities as stockholders or directors of
Holdings or any of its subsidiaries.



 








5.



Indemnification.
 



 








(a)



Holdings and Neiman Marcus shall,
jointly and severally:



 
(i)indemnify Manager and each
Manager Related Party (collectively, the “Indemnified
Parties”) to the fullest extent permitted by law, from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint
or several, directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based
upon, or arising out of the rendering of any advice or performance
of any services by any Indemnified Party for Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries, in each case, except for any such loss, claim, damage
or liability resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party as determined by a
final, non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and
 



 

 
 
(ii)promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Parties for all costs and expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees and expenses and the reasonable costs and
expenses of enforcing this Section 5), as incurred, in connection
with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any
pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising
therefrom, whether or not any Indemnified Party is a party and
whether or not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or
brought by or on behalf of Holdings or any of its subsidiaries and
whether or not such claim, action or proceeding results in any
liability.
 








(b)



Neither Manager nor any Manager
Related Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect,
in contract or tort or otherwise) to Holdings or any of its
Affiliates, or any of the security holders or creditors of Holdings
or any of their respective Affiliates directly or indirectly caused
by, related to, based upon, or arising out of (i) the engagement of
Manager pursuant to this Agreement, the performance of the services
to be performed hereunder, or the rendering of any advice or
performance of any services by Manager or any Manager Related Party
or (ii) any Outside Activities (as defined below). Holdings and
Neiman Marcus shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Manager and
each Manager Related Party, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
from and against any and all such liabilities to which Manager or
any Manager Related Party becomes subject.



 








(c)



Manager makes no representations or
warranties, express or implied, in respect of the services to be
provided by it hereunder.



 








(d)



For the avoidance of doubt, the
indemnity and expense reimbursement obligations set forth in this
Section 5 shall be in addition to any other rights, remedies or
indemnification that the Indemnified Parties may have or be
entitled to under either Holdings’ or Neiman Marcus’
organizational documents, applicable law or otherwise, and all such
rights and protections shall remain operative and in full force and
effect following the Term.
