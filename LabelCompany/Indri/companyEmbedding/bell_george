500 days & 700 miles in the line of fire.
George Bell never cared to talk much about his wartime experiences. He was just ‘doing his bit’ for King and Country..... no big deal. 

It wasn’t until after my father died in 1995 that I was compelled to find out more. Based mainly on Brigade War Diaries from the National Archives in Kew, the REME Museum in Reading and the Imperial War Museum in London, George Bell’s War brings together my curious research and confirms all I have been thinking for years  .......   My father, my hero.

There were hundreds of thousands just like my dear Dad, each and every one with a one in three chance of coming to significant harm on foreign soil. 

Ordinary men in the prime of their lives. 

In this, the 70th anniversary year of the liberation of Western Europe, I hope you feel as much pride reading this little book as I got from compiling it.

God bless them all.

                    By Elizabeth Fothergill
                

                                        Apr 11, 2014
                


                                The diary narrative of this book is a siphon, taking the reader on a specific journey in time; a soldier obeying orders without context and without question, trusting without choice that the mission would contribute to the overall war effort. "He (George Bell) did his bit", and so did so many others in various times and places, none of them pausing to truly recognize the summative impact of their service. Using diary excerpts and archived artifacts, David Bell has captured a rare first-person perspective from inside the war that we only know from the outside.

 The Fit Is Great
 I love this jacket I have it in navy and rose. The fit is great I love an A line shape. I have many of them in different styles. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5stars because the sleeves are bell sleeves and I have short arms. I try to cuff it up but it flops back. I wish he could make a shorter bell sleeve.

 Nice jacket
 I ordered this jacket in the navy and a size large. It fit great every where except the length and it was way to long. I loved the bell sleeves and the jacket is of excellent quality. Very nice lining and the material of the jacket is really nice. I ordered up a size so I could wear a top under the jacket. If you are a tall person this jacket would really look nice on you but if you are 5'3" and under it is long. I gave it 4 stars because of the length of the jacket. I have returned the jacket.

 Best Purchase Ever!!
 I've had this jacket for awhile now and I love it!! I get so many compliments when I wear it, it's great!! It's one of my favorite jackets. I love George Simonton, he's really knows how to cut for a woman's body. it runs a little big, but it's very comfy!! I wanna get the magenta someday, I have it in the navy it's my favorite color with a little metallics in it. Ladies get this jacket, you won't be disappointed!!

 Not For The Very Small
 This is the second item I've returned that was passed the 30 day policy. As I said before everyone doesn't jump right into something they have just purchased. Make sure you try everything on as soon as you get it. Otherwise you maybe stuck with something you can't wear. Or better yet maybe QVC should have better measurements. If you are a size XS or smaller, this is not the jacket for you.

 Absolutely GORGEOUS!
 Got the jacket yesterday and I never expected for it to be so stunning. Size 1X fits perfectly. Purchased both navy and magenta. Both colors so rich and classy. Extemely well constructed. Sturdy fabric. Can be worn with jeans or a dressy outfit. The bell sleeve is so unique and is just the right touch to make this an item that you won't see yourself coming and going. Mr. Simonton you never cease to amaze me. Thank you for sharing your talent.
Love love love it!

 Runs large but it is beautiful
 This item does run a bit large. I am a big lady so it was a welcome surprise! The arms don't run larger so they were a bit snug. I received many compliments when I wore this jacket in navy blue! I would buy in different colors and for the price you can't beat it!
 03-25-11
 Nice Spring Jacket but oversized !! Too big
 I always love giving George Simmonton garments as gifts but with this purchased when I opened the package i saw right off that this was cut oversized. It seemed to be one to two sizes too big. I loved the quality and design of this jacket. The quality of George Simmontons clothing is way above all others. I bought the navy and it is a beautiful color. Sure did not want to have to send this back. Debating if I should order a size smaller.
George if you read this please bring this back with more shape not so boxy !! Maybe add some princess seams to make the jacket more fitted and more shape so it is not so large. Also, I loved the bell sleeves.
 03-18-11
 Stunning Jacket!
 I just received the navy jacket today and it is GEORGEOUS! What a wonderful addition to my jacket collection. Very nicely made, good fit (very generous) and the finishing touches are just stunning. With the easy pay and free shipping, don't pass this one up ladies!!!
 03-11-11
 Perfect for Spring
 I just received this jacket in magenta and the color is flattering since I have grey hair. I usually wear a 1X and I'm 5 ft tall but I got an XL and it is perfect and the length is good for me too. I have short arms and hem most coat sleeves but these are not lined and so easy to cut off 2 in. and hem by hand. People seem to complain about the long sleeves but you can fix them yourself so easily. The style is slimming on me too. It looks great with navy, grey, beige or white and with a scarf.
 03-08-11
 HURRY LADIES...BUY THIS JACKET YOU WILL LOVE IT!
 This jacket is a "true" designer look. I have the navy. It is so classy. What a great outfit for Easter Sunday. Thanks George for designer pieces that I can afford!
 03-04-11
 Very pretty but runs HUGE
 I ordered a small, my normal size and it swallowed me up. You might consider sizing down. It is well executed and very stylish. The fabric is very substantial.

About Bell Forest Products…


Birdseye Maple & Curly Maple

Located in Northern Michigan, we are in the center of Birdseye Maple Country. Each week local loggers harvest Birdseye Maple and Curly Maple (Tiger Maple) trees and bring them to area log bids. We regularly visit these bids to choose the best logs available. Once the auction has finished, the logs are delivered to our sawmill located one-half mile from our warehouse. We mill up the Birdseye Maple and Curly Maple (Tiger Maple) into lumber and then stack it into one of our dehumidification kilns, where it stays for about one month, until dry.

Curly Maple (Tiger Maple)

Exotic Wood
Cue Builders, Bowl & Pen Turners, Bowyers, Game Call Makers, and many other specialty woodworkers love the look of nicely finished exotic wood. With the power of the Internet we are able to provide our over fifty species of exotic wood to woodworkers from around the world. As each new niche woodworking market develops, we are eager to provide the exotic wood species and sizes that meet their demand.
Exotic Wood Blanks

Wholesale & Custom Milling Available
In addition to our retail website we offer a full line of exotic lumber at wholesale. If you are a lumberyard or custom carpenter looking for a couple hundred, or a few thousand, board feet of Birdseye Maple, Curly Maple, or any of the exotics, please contact us. We regularly ship freight quantities of lumber all around the United States, Canada, and overseas.
If you are in need of custom milling for your business, please contact us. Our family business owns a full sawmill, two dehumidification kilns, and dozens of shop tools from industrial planers to multiple dowelling machines. Our rates are extremely competitive. Go make some sawdust!

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
