Reel-to-Reel



Home  /  CVD Engineering  /  Reel-to-Reel 








Reel-to-Reel Technology

CVD Equipment Corporation’s reel-to-reel (roll-to-roll) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process tools deposit materials on a continuous roll of metal foils, plastic sheets, fibers, and other materials in place of individual substrates. The technology has been used for superconductor tape production*, nanomaterial synthesis, aerospace materials, and ALD coatings. Reel-to-reel processing offers high production volumes at a low cost. In-line reel-to-reel processing is often preferred over batch processing for applications where multiple in-line processing steps are required.
We have developed reel-to-reel systems for many applications. Custom systems can be engineered to accommodate various substrate widths and lengths.
*CVD systems have set world records for superconductivity (>300,330 amp-meter performance in 1,065 meter length of 2G HTS wire)

Process Software



Home  /  Parts & Services  /  Process Software 









Our CVDWinPrC™ process control software suite is built on a National Instruments LabWindows™ software platform. It generates the programmable, rampable analog setpoints, and dwell times required for precise gas flow, pressure, and temperature controlled profiles. The software suite is comprised of the following four programs: CVDprocessControl, CVDdataViewer, CVDrecipeEditor, and CVDconfigEditor.
Typical basic operator learning time for the CVDWinPrC™ software suite is two (2) hours. Numerous user configurable software features are incorporated to optimize the productivity of each system. The system can also be connected to the internet allowing CVD Equipment Corporation to view the current status of the system and have remote system operation (after local permission is given) to help train  new operators, upload new software features, and assist in diagnosing system problems. During a power outage, there is no loss of programs or recipes.  The software suite has multi-level password protection (Owner, Engineer, Service Technician, Operator) to prevent unauthorized recipe program changes, improper digital, or analog output status changes.
CVDWinPrC™ is the system control software suite used for manual or automatic process operation and system control as well as to view system status. System status is viewed from multiple windows showing various system information including control panel, status messages, time dependent charts of selected analog, and/or digital process variables, digital, and analog output status, etc.




The CVDWinPrC™ process software executes process recipe time and event driven sequences, setting digital, and analog outputs required for process operation of gas valves, gas flows, temperatures, pressures, heaters, pumps, etc. Further, on a real time basis, it monitors and logs all analog and digital parameters, including flow, pressure, and temperature data, valve states, process deviations, safety status, and graphically displays in real time graphs of user selected analog and digital system parameters (gas flows, pressures, and temperatures). The control panel displays the process step, elapsed sequence time, process set points, process values, and other system relevant parameters.
In the event a process parameter (gas flow, temperature, or pressure) is out of a programmed deviation band, the user has the option to automatically switch to a preprogrammed abort mode or to another preprogrammed process sequence.
The CVDWinPrC™ software has realtime multi-parameter, time sequenced graphing features that allow you to compare previous run graphs to look for process changes. Saved graphs of previous process runs can be recalled at any time, including during an ongoing process run, to allow ease of comparison of process, or system parameters.




All process data is saved. The CVDdataViewer program allows the user to select which data is exported to a CSV format for importing into Excel™ or other program for further analysis.  This allows the user to create professional looking process graphs and to combine the data from multiple process runs into one graph for easier comparison.



The CVDrecipeEditor program is used for the generation and editing of process recipes that are used by CVDWinPrC™. At each process step each process variable can be controlled, ramped, used for alarms, process branching, etc.




The CVDconfigEditor program is used to define the name of all available process variables (analog, digital input, and outputs, parameter setup for the PLC and thermal controller configurations, etc.) and to setup the initial system configuration.
A battery back-up (UPS) provides power for uninterrupted real time monitoring of all system functions during a power failure and allows for a preprogrammed orderly shutdown on an abort condition by supplying power to the system PLC and PC running the CVDWinPrC™ software suite. The battery back-up system does not power the vacuum pump(s) or heating system during a power failure.

Gas & Chemical



Home  /  Systems  /  Gas & Chemical 







Gas & Chemical
Many processes require the use of hazardous gases which can be flammable, toxic, or pyrophoric. Industry standards and government regulations mandate the proper storage and safe delivery of these gases to the process tools to ensure that hazards to personnel are minimized. Post process effluent gases also need to be properly treated and neutralized to meet environmental safety standards.
We offer a complete line of gas storage, gas delivery, and gas abatement systems to meet any process requirement. Our turnkey solutions allow you to configure a totally integrated system, including safety interlocks and interconnecting gas lines, to support your production projects safely and with peace of mind.

CVD Equipment Corporation Offers Three Dimensional Graphene™ Products






Business Wire




Nov 29, 2011 5:40 PM EST













 


















































  (NASDAQ: CVV) CVD Equipment Corporation (CVD), today launched a new line of chemical vapor deposited three dimensional graphene products that will be marketed under the trade name CVD3  D  Graphene™ and is expected to enable new high performance products.  Karlheinz Strobl, V.P. of Business Development, states, “The CVD3  D  Graphene™ cellular material platform is based on a three dimensional graphene-foam like material having several two dimensional (a few atomic layers thick) graphene sheets that are mechanically and electrically fully interconnected in three dimensions. This novel, highly customizable material platform enables the preservation of many of the high performance material properties of the traditional one atom thick two dimensional graphene sheets. Such three dimensional graphene materials can be further functionalized by chemical vapor deposition, electro deposition and/or chemical grafting to develop even more advanced materials for high performance product developments. This new nano-material platform interconnects the two dimensional nano world with the three dimensional macroscopic world of products in a more manufacturable manner. The novel material platform is already being explored by innovators for a growing range of product applications. It is anticipated that as additional variations of the material are developed, more growth market opportunities will become available.”  " CVD Materials Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of CVD Equipment Corporation that focuses on providing a range of nano-enabled materials and products,” said Leonard Rosenbaum, President. “By leveraging our custom equipment design and manufacturing capabilities with the process development and manufacturing capabilities of our Application Laboratory, CVD Materials Corporation can optimally focus on shortening the time to market for novel 'nano-enhanced' material products. With the commercialization of CVD3  D  Graphene™ cellular materials using a range of Nickel foam templates and by tuning the thickness of the carbon film layers we can provide an expanded range of CVDGraphene™ research materials that enables our customers to develop new products, including: higher performance batteries; ultracapacitors; and gas, liquid and bio sensors.”  About CVD Equipment Corporation  CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ: CVV) is a designer and manufacturer of custom and standard state-of-the-art equipment used in the development, design and manufacture of advanced electronic components, materials and coatings for research and industrial applications. CVD offers a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control, and other equipment that is used by customers to research, design and manufacture semiconductors, solar cells, graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, LEDs, MEMS, smart glass coatings, battery and/or ultra capacitor materials, medical coatings, industrial coatings and equipment for surface mounting of components onto printed circuit boards.

What Researchers are Saying About Our Systems
I built two CVD systems when setting up my lab. They were basically clones of a system I had used previously, so the design was already in my mind and mostly down on paper. However, I severely underestimated the time involved in selecting all the proper pieces and parts. By the time things finally came together and the first system came on-line, I found myself wishing I had simply purchased complete solutions from a company that had already invested the time to engineer a reliable system. As a new faculty member, funds are a limited resource, but time is even more so. Quickly getting the ball rolling on research is worth more than what one might save with a home-built approach.
- Erik Einarsson, Ph.D, Assistant Professor"I am glad to share with you the good news that ever since the very first batch of samples we continued to produce long and uniform silicon nanowires. Suffice to say that members of our research group are all impressed with the turn-key reliability as well as extensive safety features of this LPCVD system which greatly satisfy the needs of our fundamental research program in nanomaterials. We also appreciate the custom system design effort to cater to our needs from your  expert team and your ability to deliver and install in a timely manner."
- Jie Xiang, Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering"The FN/CVD Application & Research Lab provides our company with one-stop CNT process capabilities and technical staff support that we simply cannot get anywhere else and that help us accelerate the commercialization of our proprietary thin film technologies"
- Vincent Stenger, Ph.D, Principal Research Engineer"EasyTube® provides a very versatile platform for synthesizing various semiconductor nanowires. The configuration allows for consistent nanowire growths."
- Yi Gu, Ph.D, Assistant Professor of Physics | Gu Research Group"The researchers at the University of Cincinnati partnered with FirstNano®, a division of CVD Equipment Corp. of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., to use their laboratory and a specialized furnace called EasyTube® 3000.  With this equipment, the research team succeeded to produce 18 millimeter long CNT array which is considered the longest aligned CNTs reported ever."
- Dr. Vesselin Shanov, Associate Professor of Chemical and Materials Engineering "It has been a pleasurable interaction with the FirstNano® process and development team. Collectively, collaborations between the Cornell Nanoscale Facility and FirstNano® have yielded single wall carbon nanotube growth from lithographically defined catalyst pads on full four inch wafers. Incorporating wafer scale nanoscale fabrication processes with predefined carbon based systems represents a major step forward in creating complex carbon based nanostructures. This enhanced functionality raises intriguing possibilities in modern scientific research of widely disparate endeavors."
- B. Rob Ilic, Ph.D, Research Associate | User Program Manager"The purchase of the EasyTube® 3000 will enlarge the spectrum of our research with the growth of heterostructured nanowires, their doping, and with the possibility to extend the growth to a wide variety of other materials thanks to the liquid precursor kits. Our projects cover fundamental aspects (growth, carrier transport …) as well as potential applications (Nanoelectronics, Solar Energy, Nanophotonics, MEMS, and Sensors)."
- Pascal Gentile , Laboratory of Physics of Materials and Microstructures

Magnet Generator System:


 











Hydraulically Driven Generator System provides superior, reliable performance in magnet operations.


Fast, clean load release increases productivity. Discharge times can be adjusted for various material weights.


Electrical components are designed for 100% duty cycle, easy access and serviceability.


Baldor Generator and Hubbell Controller - proven and accepted in the scrap recycling industry.
	
High-thermal capacity varistor limits voltage spikes and provides essential circuit protection.
	
Amp and volt meters, conveniently mounted on the controller door, helps monitor the 230 volt electrical system.
	
Tachometer, also mounted on the controller door, indicates the generator speed and assists with diagnosing the hydraulic system.
	
All electrical circuits are fused.


Includes safety on-off switch for maintenance.





Hydraulic components include:

Young control valve that keeps the generator running at optimum speed, turns off the generator during grapple operation, and permits dialing in the correct flow to prevent "hunting".
	
Piston motor offers reduced noise.
	
Dedicated pump ensures a constant flow of oil.
	

Controls in the cab allow operating a magnet or grapple, or a magnet and grapple simultaneously.    Includes a cab mounted volt meter and generator on-off switch.

Available in 15kw, 20kw, 25kw, 33kw and 60kw systems.

Conveniently mounts inside a cab riser.
