Have you been invited to receive a free Catapult Health Preventive Checkup at your workplace?
The information here is designed to communicate the benefits of a preventive checkup, answer your questions, and prepare you for your checkup!

Why participate?
What does a Checkup include?
How do I prepare for my checkup?
How do I know if I am eligible?
How does this compare with a physical exam by my doctor?
Will there be out-of-pocket costs?
Who will review my results with me?
How do I schedule an appointment?
What should I expect the day of the Checkup?
How do my results get to my doctor?
What if I don't have a doctor?
How is my privacy protected?
How can I get a Vaccine Information Statement?


Why participate?
You will learn accurate, actionable information about yourself and your risks related to diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
A certified Nurse Practitioner will answer your healthcare questions and review your results with you in a private setting. Your information will also be sent to your doctor. If you don't have a doctor, Catapult can help you find one.
You will leave with a Personal Action Plan that will help you reduce your risks and improve your quality of life.
What does a Checkup include?
Immediate lab-accurate results for Glucose, Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides, AST, ALT, Blood Pressure, Height, Weight, Body Mass Index, Abdominal Circumference and A1C (if appropriate)
A detailed personal health report
Review of current medications, health conditions, and your personal report with a certified Nurse Practitioner
Delivery of your results to your doctor
How do I prepare for my checkup?
Do not eat or drink (besides water) for at least 8 hours prior to your appointment.
Drink as much water as you'd like prior to your appointment.
Please be on time.
Take your medications as prescribed the morning of your checkup, and bring your prescriptions or other medications you're currently taking with you to your appointment.
You'll need to bare your upper arm for blood pressure measurement.
Make a list of items you want to discuss with your Nurse Practitioner.
If you have a primary care physician, bring his or her name with you.
Catapult Health recommends all pregnant women visit their regular OB/GYN for all pre-natal care, including blood testing, and participation in this health evaluation is therefore not available for pregnant women. If you are pregnant and already made an appointment, please cancel your appointment.
How do I know if I am eligible?
Your employer will be communicating who is eligible for this benefit. If you have become eligible in less than 45 days prior to the Checkup, please bring your health insurance card with you.
How does this compare with a physical exam by my doctor?
Your Catapult Checkup focuses on preventive care, whereas an exam by your doctor likely includes more invasive tests that require more privacy than is typically available in a workplace setting.
Will there be out-of-pocket costs?
No. Your employer will pay 100%.
Who will review my results with me?
A highly-skilled Catapult Nurse Practitioner will review your results and answer your questions. Nurse Practitioners have advanced degrees that qualify them to diagnose medical problems, order treatments, and even prescribe medications. However, any need for new or adjustments to current medications will be referred back to your doctor.
How do I schedule an appointment?
Check with your employer to get a web address where you can choose the date and time of your appointment.  If you don't have internet access, your employer will have another sign-up option for you.
What should I expect the day of the Checkup?
Results! You will sign in and provide information that allows Catapult to securely identify you in the system. A Catapult Health Technician will administer your tests (including a finger stick to draw a few drops of blood) and you will answer a few questions about your health history using a touch screen computer. A personal report will be produced and you will meet privately one-on-one with a Catapult Nurse Practitioner. The entire visit usually takes about 45 minutes.
What else is available?
In some situations Catapult is able to administer flu shots and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis or whooping cough) vaccinations, which are needed at least once every 10 years.
How do my results get to my doctor?
Within 24 hours your results will be encrypted and sent securely by eFax to your doctor. Catapult has most doctors' names and fax numbers on file, but just in case please bring your doctor's fax number if possible.
What if I don't have a doctor?
It is important to have doctor who can care for you when you need it. This is often referred to as a Primary Care Physician or PCP. Your health plan has a web site where you can choose a provider based on your preferences (gender, languages, locations, etc.). Not all doctors are accepting new patients. Please call the office of the doctor in whom you are interested to see if they accept new patients and your insurance.
How is my privacy protected?
Catapult respects each person's right to privacy and complies with or exceeds all State and Federal requirements. Your results will be seen only by you and the Catapult health professionals–never by your employer or co-workers. Privacy screens, results reporting policies, minimal use of paper forms, and other procedures are in place to maximize protection of private information.
How can I get a Vaccine Information Statement?
Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are information sheets produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). VISs explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine. Below are links to information about the vaccinations currently offered by Catapult Health.
Influenza (English)
Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (English)
Influenza (español)
Tétanos, difteria y tos ferina (español)

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.
