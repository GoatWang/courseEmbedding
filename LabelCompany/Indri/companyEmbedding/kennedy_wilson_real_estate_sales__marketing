How Real Estate Companies Can Use Automated Lead Scoring To Get More Appointments and Interested Buyers





In this use case you'll learn:

How to re-activate an old list and identify those contacts who are still interested
Identify and tag your contact's exact interests so that you can send them targeted follow-up
Automate your sales process for maximum efficiency


Tags
CRM, Marketing Automation, Real Estate, Small Business, Use Case 





Many real estate companies collect email addresses on their web site and within advertisements. People looking for a new place to live visit their property listings and submit forms to receive more information such as whether a location is available, facilities nearby, price, etc. They also usually collect leads through real estate trade-shows, potential buyers coming to their offices, etc. but the vast majority of contacts come from the webforms that exist in each of their listings.

When they ask a question about a property, a real estate company invites them to opt-into their newsletter list so they can be updated with news, offers, price changes, etc. A savvy real estate company can quickly generate a substantial list of leads and want to begin leveraging their list to generate more business. Many teams use traditional email marketing campaigns, but marketing automation open up new possibilities and have many advantages over autoresponders and traditional email marketing services such as Mailchimp and Aweber.
1. The context
A real estate company who is new to marketing automation should create well-defined goals:

You’d probably like to “reactivate” old contacts to see if they’d like to search a new house. Some contacts are actively looking for a new apartment at one time, but you might not of heard back from them. You need to find out: ‘Are they still interested? Have they found a new house?’ Once the contacts are reactivated, you can build your relationship with them and help them find a property if they are still looking.
You can leverage the CRM component of ActiveCampaign to better manage your best leads and deals and automated email marketing to get back to less interested people so that you can focus on your best opportunities and use automation to turn lukewarm prospects into solid deals.

2. The campaign and some of the ActiveCampaign features used
Activating people: Who is still interested?
If your list is older, you need to start with figuring out who is still interested.
You can easily create a one-time campaign for this. Using the RSS feed from your site you can prepare this in less than 30 mins:

Categorizing people: Who is interested in what?
Using ActiveCampaign’s Site Tracking feature you can see which contacts visit which listings:

 
You can create an automation to apply a tag that can identifies who is interested in not only what kind of property but also what area:

By doing this for all the areas you cover, you can create profile of exactly what potential buyer is interested in:

Sending targeted campaigns
Decide how you define interests and then follow-up on those interests. You might choose something like:

If a contact has visited at least 2 or 3 listing of the same area, automation with send specific listings about that area.
If a contact visited a property individual page more than 5-6 times, create deal and manual follow up.


If someone has visited a certain listing 5 or 6 times they are probably really interested in it and they may want to make an appointment  to visit the property. For this purpose, you could create an automation:


If a contact visited a page more than 5-6 times, create a deal and manually follow up. The reason to create a Deal? Because that’s going to allow them to contact that potential buyer in a more individual way by contacting him through their Gmail account (those emails can be tracked within ActiveCampaign).
If a contact does not reply to the email invitation where the real estate company tries to book an appointment for a visit, try with another channel of communication like a phone call or SMS.
If the contact comes back to the site after doing a manual follow-up, move him automatically into another stage of the deal, try to get an appointment.

Setting up an SMS is as easy as including an email in an automation. It implies an additional cost per SMS but its return on investment can be really high.

Usually the sales team distributes the work without assigning a sales person specifically to a deal. For this reason, having a CRM where everyone can access to the status of every deal is essential.
Your whole team can have their personal email accounts synced with the tool, so it’s pretty easy to handle any deal no matter if they have previously worked on it or if it has been one of your colleagues.
If there is a person on your team who especially good at closing deals, he could handle that particular aspect. You can automatically create tasks for him when the deal moves to that stage of your pipeline.

About  

Meyers Research, a Kennedy Wilson Company, combines experienced real estate and technology advisors with leading data to provide our clients with a clear perspective and a strategic path forward. Based in Beverly Hills, we are home to 150 experts in 10 offices across the country.
 
COMPANY FOOTPRINT
We provide clients with a national perspective and local expertise. Our advisory team delves into each market to understand what’s happening on the ground. Here are the studies completed since 2013:

 
INDUSTRY PARTNERS
Meyers Research brings real estate, technology and data together to help clients, community and industry innovate. Meyers Research partnerships bring together companies and organizations from the worlds of real estate, urban economics, technology, data, business and education to collaborate. For partner inquiries email hello@meyersresearchllc.com.

Meyers Research is collaborating with BDX to provide unparalleled depth and breadth of data for sales and marketing teams. BDX is the nation’s leading provider of digital marketing solutions for home builders and was formed by a consortium of 32 of the largest builders.

Meyers Research has partnered with HomeAid America to shine light upon and rally more support for building shelters in communities around the country. HomeAid is a leading national non-profit provider of housing for today’s transitional homeless.
 

 
Meyers Research annually hosts an economic forecast session at the East Coast’s largest trade show hosted by the New Jersey Builders Association. The Atlantic Builders Convention attendees gain up-to-date information about the latest market trends, government policies and technical developments at educational seminars.
 

 
Meyers Research is an active participant in the planning of PCBC, the largest home building trade show representing the West Coast region. The annual two-day conference, product display, and business exchange is open to anyone professionally involved in the building industry.
 

 
Meyers Research is hosting with Pirch Frame events for inspiring vision and experience. Together we are aligned in driving our industry to challenge the status quo in communities.
 

 
Meyers Research is working with Professional Builder as a media sponsor. Professional Builder provides breaking news, industry trends, product innovations, and best practices for the U.S. home building industry.
 

 
Meyers Research is also a committed member of the Urban Land Institute, which provides leadership in the responsible use of land and in creating and sustaining thriving communities worldwide. Being an independent global nonprofit, it’s supported by members representing the entire spectrum of real estate development and land use disciplines.
 
 
 
UNIVERSITY PARTNERS
Meyers Research builds relationships with premier universities who are on the forefront of thought leadership and practice of creating and sustaining thriving communities.
 

 
Meyers Research has joined efforts with the Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation to produce quarterly reports on the current state of the East Coast housing market. Meyers Research Chief Economist, Kevin Gillen, Ph.D. leads the research and analysis which gets published on our blog.
 

 
Meyers Research is a long-term sponsor of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, which seeks to advance real estate knowledge, inform business practice, and address timely issues that affect the real estate industry, the urban economy, and public policy.

Kennedy Wilson Strengthens Commercial Real Estate Sales Capabilities




Rob Hannan joins company as managing director of investment sales






March 01, 2011 08:10 AM Eastern Standard Time



BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mary Ricks, executive vice chair of international real estate investment 
      and services firm Kennedy 
      Wilson (NYSE: KW), today announced that Rob Hannan has joined 
      the company as managing director of investment sales. Kennedy Wilson 
      operates as a top provider of real estate services to various 
      institutional clients and government agencies.
    


      “Rob will be a great asset to the company as we expand our commercial 
      sales group,” stated Ricks. “He brings a wealth of experience in Kennedy 
      Wilson’s core markets, and we are pleased to welcome him to our team.”
    

      Hannan joins Kennedy Wilson from CB Richard Ellis, where he specialized 
      in the sale of investment properties and distressed assets for 
      institutional clients, lenders, special servicers and real estate 
      developers. During his six year tenure with the firm, he participated in 
      over $6 billion of investment property sales throughout the West Coast, 
      with an emphasis on Southern California, Las Vegas, and Hawaii.
    

      “I am excited to join a company that not only focuses on the West Coast 
      but also has significant experience in Hawaii,” commented Hannan. “I was 
      raised in Hawaii and know the area very well. I believe in the market 
      and look forward to bringing my knowledge and relationships to Kennedy 
      Wilson.”
    

      Prior to working at CBRE, Hannan was instrumental in introducing 
      Honolulu as an investment market at Santa Monica-based REIT Douglas 
      Emmett, Inc., leading to the company’s acquisition of more than $300 
      million of office and multifamily product in Hawaii. Hannan began his 
      real estate career at PM Realty Advisors, where he helped to acquire 
      assets across all product types and assisted in the portfolio management 
      of separate core accounts. He is a graduate of Boston College.

How Real Estate Companies Can Use Automated Lead Scoring To Get More Appointments and Interested Buyers





In this use case you'll learn:

How to re-activate an old list and identify those contacts who are still interested
Identify and tag your contact's exact interests so that you can send them targeted follow-up
Automate your sales process for maximum efficiency


Tags
CRM, Marketing Automation, Real Estate, Small Business, Use Case 





Many real estate companies collect email addresses on their web site and within advertisements. People looking for a new place to live visit their property listings and submit forms to receive more information such as whether a location is available, facilities nearby, price, etc. They also usually collect leads through real estate trade-shows, potential buyers coming to their offices, etc. but the vast majority of contacts come from the webforms that exist in each of their listings.

When they ask a question about a property, a real estate company invites them to opt-into their newsletter list so they can be updated with news, offers, price changes, etc. A savvy real estate company can quickly generate a substantial list of leads and want to begin leveraging their list to generate more business. Many teams use traditional email marketing campaigns, but marketing automation open up new possibilities and have many advantages over autoresponders and traditional email marketing services such as Mailchimp and Aweber.
1. The context
A real estate company who is new to marketing automation should create well-defined goals:

You’d probably like to “reactivate” old contacts to see if they’d like to search a new house. Some contacts are actively looking for a new apartment at one time, but you might not of heard back from them. You need to find out: ‘Are they still interested? Have they found a new house?’ Once the contacts are reactivated, you can build your relationship with them and help them find a property if they are still looking.
You can leverage the CRM component of ActiveCampaign to better manage your best leads and deals and automated email marketing to get back to less interested people so that you can focus on your best opportunities and use automation to turn lukewarm prospects into solid deals.

2. The campaign and some of the ActiveCampaign features used
Activating people: Who is still interested?
If your list is older, you need to start with figuring out who is still interested.
You can easily create a one-time campaign for this. Using the RSS feed from your site you can prepare this in less than 30 mins:

Categorizing people: Who is interested in what?
Using ActiveCampaign’s Site Tracking feature you can see which contacts visit which listings:

 
You can create an automation to apply a tag that can identifies who is interested in not only what kind of property but also what area:

By doing this for all the areas you cover, you can create profile of exactly what potential buyer is interested in:

Sending targeted campaigns
Decide how you define interests and then follow-up on those interests. You might choose something like:

If a contact has visited at least 2 or 3 listing of the same area, automation with send specific listings about that area.
If a contact visited a property individual page more than 5-6 times, create deal and manual follow up.


If someone has visited a certain listing 5 or 6 times they are probably really interested in it and they may want to make an appointment  to visit the property. For this purpose, you could create an automation:


If a contact visited a page more than 5-6 times, create a deal and manually follow up. The reason to create a Deal? Because that’s going to allow them to contact that potential buyer in a more individual way by contacting him through their Gmail account (those emails can be tracked within ActiveCampaign).
If a contact does not reply to the email invitation where the real estate company tries to book an appointment for a visit, try with another channel of communication like a phone call or SMS.
If the contact comes back to the site after doing a manual follow-up, move him automatically into another stage of the deal, try to get an appointment.

Setting up an SMS is as easy as including an email in an automation. It implies an additional cost per SMS but its return on investment can be really high.

Usually the sales team distributes the work without assigning a sales person specifically to a deal. For this reason, having a CRM where everyone can access to the status of every deal is essential.
Your whole team can have their personal email accounts synced with the tool, so it’s pretty easy to handle any deal no matter if they have previously worked on it or if it has been one of your colleagues.
If there is a person on your team who especially good at closing deals, he could handle that particular aspect. You can automatically create tasks for him when the deal moves to that stage of your pipeline.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
