Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited Provides Earnings Guidance for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 26 17
Sunfonda Group Holdings Limited provides earnings guidance for the six months ended June 30, 2017. For the period, the company expected that there would be a substantial increase in the Group's consolidated profit for the six months ended 30 June 2017, and that the profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 would be not less than 400% of that for the same period last year. The Board believes that the increase in profit attributable to owners of the parent for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was mainly attributed to improvement of the Group's operational integrated management efficiency; significant increase in gross profit margin of new automobiles as a result of the major brands' prominent performance with more clear advantage of the brand portfolio; and stable growth in income from after-sales services with rapid development of other derivative businesses.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
