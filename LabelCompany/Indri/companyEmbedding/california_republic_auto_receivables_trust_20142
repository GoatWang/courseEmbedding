RECEIVABLES
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”)
is made as of June 1, 2014, by and between CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC
BANK, a California corporation (in such capacity and for purposes
of this Agreement only, the “Seller”), and CALIFORNIA
REPUBLIC FUNDING, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
“Purchaser”).

WHEREAS, in the regular course of its business, motor vehicle
retail installment sale contracts and motor vehicle loans secured
in each case by an automobile, sport utility vehicle, light duty
truck or similar motor vehicle (“Auto Receivables”)
were assigned by dealers to the Seller located in the state where
such dealer was located;

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller a portfolio of
Auto Receivables (the “Receivables”);

WHEREAS, Seller is willing to sell such Receivables to
Purchaser;

WHEREAS, Seller is selling such Receivables to Purchaser and
Purchaser is buying such Receivables for the purpose of selling
those Receivables to California Republic Auto Receivables Trust
2014-2 which will in turn issue notes and certificates backed by
the cash flow from those Receivables in a transaction contemplated
by the parties to this Agreement and the other Basic Documents (as
defined below) to be a “securitization” as that term is
defined in 12 CFR §360.6 (the “FDIC Rule”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in reliance upon the foregoing recitals, in
consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

Section 1.01. Definitions . Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein are used in this Agreement as defined in
Appendix A of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of
June 1, 2014, among California Republic Auto Receivables Trust
2014-2, as Issuer, California Republic Funding, LLC, as Depositor,
California Republic Bank, as Seller, Servicer, Administrator and
Custodian, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Indenture
Trustee, and CSC Logic, Inc., as Backup Servicer or in the Amended
and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2014,
between California Republic Funding, LLC, as Depositor, and
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Owner Trustee.

Section 1.02. Other Interpretive Provisions . For
purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) accounting terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement,
and accounting terms partly defined in this Agreement to the extent
not defined, shall have the respective meanings given to them under
GAAP; (b) terms defined in Article 9 of the California UCC and
not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used as defined in that
Article; (c) the words “hereof,”
“herein” and “hereunder” and words of
similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (d) references to any
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit are references to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits in or to this Agreement and
references to any paragraph, subsection, clause or other
subdivision within


any Section or
definition refer to such paragraph, subsection, clause or other
subdivision of such Section or definition; (e) the term
“including” means “including without
limitation”; (f) except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, references to any agreement, law or regulation refer to
that agreement, law or regulation as amended from time to time and
include any successor law or regulation; (g) references to any
Person include that Person’s successors and assigns; and
(h) headings are for purposes of reference only and shall not
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision
hereof.

ARTICLE II
PURCHASE AND
SALE OF RECEIVABLES

Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale of Receivables .
Effective as of the Closing Date and immediately prior to the
transactions pursuant to the Indenture, the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, and the Trust Agreement, Seller does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to Purchaser,
without recourse (subject to the obligations herein), all right,
title and interest of Seller in and to the Conveyed Assets.

The sale, transfer, assignment, setting over and conveyance made
hereunder shall not constitute and is not intended to result in an
assumption by Purchaser of any obligation of Seller to the
Obligors, the Dealers or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables and the other assets and properties conveyed hereunder
or any agreement, document or instrument related thereto.

It is the intention of the parties hereto that, other than for
federal, State and local income, single business or franchise tax
purposes, the transfer and assignment of the Conveyed Assets on the
Closing Date constitutes an absolute sale (and not a pledge to
secure debt or other obligations of the Seller) of the Conveyed

Advantages of a living trust

Keep more money in the family by avoiding potentially lengthy and expensive court proceedings.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?

Will vs. Living Trust: What's Best for You?
by Mary S. Yamin-Garone, December 2009





 
 
 
You have worked hard for your money and made every attempt to be a conscientious saver. So it's only natural that you want some control over what happens to your assets after your die. Even if you are a person of modest means, you have an estate—and several strategies to choose from to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes and in a timely fashion: your estate plan. The right strategy depends on your individual circumstances. For some, a living trust can be a useful and practical tool. For others, it may be a waste of time and money. What is a living trust anyway? And how does it differ from a last will?
What Is a Will?
A will is a written document—signed and witnessed—that indicates how your property will be distributed at the time of your death. It is revocable and subject to amendment at any time during your lifetime. It also allows you to appoint a guardian for your minor children. More about writing a will.
What Is a Living Trust?
A living trust provides lifetime and after-death property management. If you are serving as your own trustee, the trust instrument will provide for a successor upon your death or incapacity. Court intervention is not required. Livings trusts also are used to manage property. If a person is disabled by accident or illness, the successor trustee can manage the trust property. As a result, the expense, publicity, and inconvenience of court-supervised distribution of your estate can be avoided.
If a living trust is properly written and funded you can:
Avoid probate on your assets
Plan for the possibility of your own incapacity
Control what happens to your property after you are gone
Use it for any size estate; and
Prevent your financial affairs from becoming a matter of public record
While a trust sounds appealing, there are drawbacks. A living trust is more expensive to set up than a typical will because it must be actively managed after it is created. Most importantly, however, a living trust is useless unless it is funded. A living trust only can control those assets that have been placed into it. If your assets have not been transferred or if you die without funding the trust, the trust will be of no benefit as your estate will still be subject to probate and there may be significant estate tax issues.
Will vs. Living Trust Considerations
There are many positive reasons to establish a trust but do not overlook the fact that it will involve more upfront effort and expense. To determine if you should make the extra effort and invest in the expense of a trust, answer these questions:
Is informal probate an available option? Most states have an expedited or simplified form of probate for estates under a certain dollar threshold (that dollar value varies by state). If your estate could pass under an expedited form of probate, or if you live in a state where probate is not a complex or burdensome process, a will could be appropriate.
Do you have minor children? A trust allows you to establish provisions specifying when a child will be entitled to any assets held in trust.
Do you have children, grandchildren, or other dependents with special needs? In those instances the access or control those heirs have over their inherited property may need to be limited. With a standard will your property can be passed on to those heirs but a will alone does not allow you to exercise much control over their use of the property.
Will your estate be subject to estate taxes? If the value of your estate exceeds the current estate tax threshold, you may wish to consider setting up a trust with tax planning provisions. The estate tax threshold frequently changes, so be sure to check with the IRS to determine whether or not estate tax is a concern for you.
Will you actively manage your estate plan? If not, a living trust may not be a suitable solution. Again, a trust will only be beneficial if assets are transferred into it.
So what is best for you? In many respects, a living trust and a will accomplish similar objectives. A trust, however, allows you to realize other objectives that a will cannot. But those advantages don't come without a price. Whether or not a living trust is better for you than a will depends on whether the additional advantages are worth the cost. When choosing, remember that one size does not fit all. What is right for one person may not be right for everyone. Your estate plan should be prepared in a way that best meets the needs of you and your family.
This article does not address all the intricacies associated with last wills and living trusts. Consulting with a competent attorney can help you make the right decision.

No matter where you are in the process, an attorney from our vetted network is available to help:




Getting started
You can speak with an attorney about your wishes, get answers to questions, and learn how your Estate Plan will work. Book a consultation on our site or via our Estate Planning app.





While you're working on it
As you're completing our self-guided questionnaire, an attorney is available to answer questions along the way. Once you're done, we'll handle the legal forms and send them to you with instructions on what you need to do to finalize it.





When it's done and beyond
After we've conducted our Peace of Mind ReviewTM and you download and sign your documents, an attorney is available to you for a year to make updates and answer any other legal questions.








Your Estate Plan comes with a Last Will and Testament OR a Living Trust.

Usually, people start the process when major life changes occur, like:




Loss of loved ones
As much as we don't want to think about it, everyone experiences the painful loss of loved ones. It's important to plan for the unexpected to lessen the stress during these unfortunate times.





Marriage
You've probably talked about who gets what and who would be in charge, but it's good to get it in writing so you both know there would be a plan if something unexpected happened.





Kids
More additions to the family, more people to consider. An Estate Plan allows you to plan for your children's future and choose their legal guardians.





Home
Anything you own can be included, but it's usually the big things that come to mind first. You can leave your property or anything else to family and loved ones with an Estate Plan.










Despite its name, Estate Plans aren't just for people with mansions. Here's a simple breakdown:








Last Will & Testament OR Living Trust
You pick one. A Last Will & Testament is where you specify what you want to happen when you're no longer here. A Living Trust allows you to state who receives your things when you pass away, but transfers them to a trust while you're still alive.



Power of Attorney
This allows you to put someone in charge of handling financial and legal matters for you if you're unable to do so (e.g. you're in the hospital and cannot speak for yourself).



Living Will (Advance Healthcare Directive)
This allows you to put someone in charge of making life or death decisions for you if can't (e.g. you don't want to stay on life support if you have a terminal condition, but cannot communicate that yourself).



1 year of attorney advice
This gives you the guidance you need during and after the creation of your Estate Plan. An independent attorney is there to help you update it and answer questions for legal matters such as marriage, personal injury, bankruptcy, home sales, employment agreements, and much more.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common Questions

How do I know if I need a will or a trust?
This is one of the most common questions that comes up when planning your estate. They accomplish many of the same things, but a Last Will often has to go through the probate process, while a fully funded living trust avoids probate.  But a last will is easy to create, while transferring your assets into a trust can be time consuming and require additional paperwork. However, we know that this simplified explanation is often not enough to help make this difficult decision. It's for that reason that our Estate Plan Bundle comes with a full year of our Personal Legal Plan. You can purchase the bundle, and immediately schedule a consultation with an attorney in your state to help you make this decision. Many people have to decide based on their unique personal factors (state laws, family situation, size of estate etc...), and the help of an attorney is invaluable to fully explore those details.


Do I need to speak with an attorney before starting my documents?
No, but we highly recommend it. Based on your needs, where you live and the value of your assets, a Living Trust may be more appropriate than a Last Will. An attorney who knows the laws of your state is in the best position to provide that guidance. We encourage you to make that determination before starting the Last Will questionnaire.


What if I need to make changes to my documents?
When life changes come up, many people do choose to update their Estate Planning documents, and we make that easy. One key benefit of the Estate Plan Bundle is that it comes with one full year of our Personal Legal Plan. And along with getting advice from attorneys, your membership allows you to revise your documents as often as you need to at no additional cost. 


Are LegalZoom Last Wills and Living Trusts state-specific?
Yes. Our team of experienced attorneys have designed these documents to meet the specific laws and requirements of each U.S. state.


What happens after I order my bundle?
Once you order your bundle, you decide how to start building your Estate Plan. If you have the information you need, you can jump right in and begin filling out our simple online questionnaires. If you have legal questions, you can schedule a consultation with an independent attorney in your state for help. If you have questions about our questionnaire or other technical questions, you can contact our customer care team. Once all of your questions are answered and you've submitted your questionnaires to us, we'll review your work and create your documents, sending them to you in the mail. When they arrive, make sure you're happy with them, and then follow our simple instructions for signing. Once signed, they're done! All that's left is to keep them someplace safe, and know that you can always come back to us if you need to make changes in the future.
