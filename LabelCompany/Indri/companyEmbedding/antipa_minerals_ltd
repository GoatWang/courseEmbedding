The Citadel Project is located approximately 75km north of Newcrest’s giant Telfer gold-copper-silver mine and includes the gold-copper-silver±tungsten Mineral Resources at the Calibre and Magnum deposits for a total of 1.2 million ounces of gold and 139,000 tonnes of copper, with mineralisation at both deposits remaining open in all directions, and the high-grade polymetallic Corker deposit. Under the terms of Farm-in and Joint Venture agreements Rio Tinto can fund up to $60 million of exploration expenditure to earn up to a 75% interest in Antipa’s Citadel Project.The Company's North Telfer Project consists of 1,285 sqkm of granted tenure and 17 sqkm of ground currently under application. The North Telfer Project extends from the southern boundary of the Citadel Project, which is subject to the Rio Tinto Farm-in Agreement, to within 20km of the Telfer mine and 30km of the O’Callaghans tungsten and base metal deposit. The North Telfer Project hosts a number of historically defined gold ± copper prospects including “walk-up” drilling targets at the high-grade Minyari deposit, WACA deposit and Judes prospect.The Paterson Project consists of 1,527 sqkm of granted tenure which the Company acquired from the Mark Creasy controlled company Kitchener Resources Pty Ltd. The Paterson Project hosts several historical prospects and extends the Company’s ground holding to within 5km of Telfer and 7km of O’Callaghans.The Company’s Telfer Dome Project consists of a further 164 sqkm of exploration licences (including both granted tenements and applications), which come to within 5km of Telfer and 7km of O’Callaghans and hosts several historical prospects.

​​The Calibre gold-copper-silver-tungsten deposit Inferred Mineral Resource estimated and reported in accordance with JORC 2012 by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants is 47.8 million tonnes grading 0.56 g/t gold and 0.17% copper for 867,000 ounces of gold and 81,000 tonnes of copper.The Magnum gold-copper-silver deposit Inferred Mineral Resource estimated and reported in accordance with JORC 2012 by Cube Consulting is 16.1 million tonnes grading 0.66 g/t gold and 0.36% copper for 339,000 ounces of gold and 58,000 tonnes of copper.At both Calibre and Magnum there is significant potential to delineate high grade mineralisation trends and in doing so increase the average gold and copper grades of both deposits; and also increase the size of both Mineral Resources significantly which remain open in all directions.

Telfer Dome Project
The Company's Telfer Dome Project is located in northwest Western Australia approximately 400km east of Port Headland and 1,300km north northeast of Perth. The Project is located within the Paterson Province and currently consists of 8 exploration licenses co﻿vering an area of approximately 167 sqkm (including 2 granted exploration licenses covering 6.4 sqkm) of highly prospective but grossly underexplored Proterozoic stratigraphy situated around the Telfer Dome.The project area dovetails with Antipa's wholly owned Paterson Project. Tenement boundaries in the southern tenements extend to within 5km of Newcrest's giant Telfer gold-copper-silver mine and 7km of Newcrest's O'Callaghans tungsten-base metal deposit, which is one of the world's largest tungsten deposits.The Telfer Dome Project hosts historically defined prospects such as Tim’s Dome, Wobbley’s Gossan, Bean Counter’s Gossan, Joy’s Gossan, Hasties Retreat and areas surrounding the Proto prospect and Black Hills deposit, which based on surface geochemistry (e.g. rockchips and/or soils) and/or shallow Aircore/RAB/Auger drill results require investigation by drilling.​Additionally, and importantly, the Project extends the Company’s tenement holding into regions of minimal cover and to within close proximity to major infrastructure; including the Telfer Gold and Nifty Copper mines with processing plants, airfields and village facilities (i.e. accommodation and messing), power generation stations, Telfer natural gas pipeline, road network including to port facilities in Port Hedland, etc.

Paterson ProvinceAntipa's wholly owned Citadel, Paterson, North Telfer and Telfer Dome Projects are located within the Proterozoic Paterson Province in the northwest of Western Australia approximately 400km east of Port Hedland and 1,300km north northeast of Perth. Under the terms of Farm-in and Joint Venture agreements, announced in October 2015, Rio Tinto can fund up to $60 million of exploration expenditure to earn up to a 75% interest in Antipa’s Citadel Project.Western Australia’s Paterson Province is considered to be highly prospective for giant mineral deposits but remains grossly underexplored. The Paterson Province hosts several world-class mineral deposits which are located within close proximity to Antipa's Projects, including; Australia's third largest gold producer Newcrest's giant Telfer gold-copper-silver mine, Metals X's Nifty copper mine, Newcrest's O'Callaghans tungsten and base metal skarn deposit and Cameco Corporation-Mitsubishi Corporation's Kintyre uranium deposit. The region also hosts Consolidated Minerals Ltd’s high-grade Woodie Woodie manganese mine and significant potash deposits (e.g. Reward Minerals Ltd’s LD Project).​

Corporate StrategyThe principle strategy of Antipa is to concentrate on mineral provinces which have the potential to host world class deposits and which have either been ignored in the past or have not been subject to modern exploration techniques, therefore offering high leverage exploration potential.The strategy of the Company will be driven by a Board and Management team with proven technical and commercial skills. The Board will take a disciplined approach to all exploration and development decisions to ensure they are consistent with both the strategy of the Company and the interests of shareholders.The Company will also consider the acquisition of complementary assets both in Australia and internationally as opportunities arise provided they satisfy the strategic approach adopted by the Company.



 
Key ObjectivesEvaluate the Calibre gold-copper-silver-tungsten deposit, with the goal of defining the extent and continuity of mineralisation, particularly with respect to high-grade mineralisation, and determine the deposit's economic potential.Evaluate the Magnum gold-copper-silver deposit, with the goal of defining the extent and continuity of the mineralisation, particularly with respect to high-grade mineralisation, and determine the deposit's economic potential.Undertake aggressive exploration of the broader, under-explored 30 sqkm Magnum Dome region for additional occurrences of  primarily gold and copper mineralisation to more accurately determine the economic potential of the Camp style mineral complex.Undertake regional exploration of the broader Citadel, North Telfer, Paterson and Telfer Dome Projects where both historic and Antipa exploration has delineated a number of geophysical, geochemical and conceptual targets which remain untested, and also high-grade deposits such as the Minyari and WACA deposits.Pursue other Australian and international strategic exploration or mining opportunities should they arise.

Citadel Project
The Citadel Project is located within the Paterson Province and consists of seven exploration licenses covering an area of approximately 1,111 sqkm (and a further related 225 sqkm of tenement applications) of highly prospective but grossly under-explored Proterozoic stratigraphy. Under the terms of Farm-in and Joint Venture agreements, announced in October 2015, Rio Tinto can fund up to $60 million of exploration expenditure to earn up to a 75% interest in Antipa’s Citadel Project.​The Citadel Project hosts the Calibre gold-copper-silver-tungsten deposit and the Magnum gold-copper-silver deposit with combined (JORC 2012) Mineral Resources, open in all directions, of 1.2M ounces of gold, 139,000 tonnes of copper and 1.4M ounces of silver, being testimony to the project's significant potential:Calibre deposit JORC Code (2012 Edition) Inferred Mineral Resource of 47.8 million tonnes at 0.56 g/t Au, 0.17% Cu, 0.60 g/t Ag and 0.03% W for 867,000 oz gold, 80,800 tonnes of copper, 918,000 ounces of silver and 14,200 tonnes of tungsten. Magnum deposit JORC Code (2012 Edition) Inferred Mineral Resource of 16.1 million tonnes at 0.66 g/t Au, 0.36% Cu and 0.99 g/t Ag for 339,000 oz gold, 57,800 tonnes of copper and 511,000 ounces of silver.

Minyari - WACA
In January 2015 Newcrest Mining Limited relinquished several mining leases located within the Company’s North Telfer Project area. This ground, which hosts substantial gold ± copper mineralisation, was successfully amalgamated into Antipa's North Telfer exploration licences in December 2015. As a consequence the North Telfer Project now hosts a number of historically defined gold ± copper prospects including “walk-up” high-grade drilling targets at the Minyari deposit, WACA deposit and Judes prospect.The Minyari Dome hosts several mineral systems, including both the Minyari and WACA deposits where at the former significant high-grade gold mineralisation occurs from within one to several metres of the surface, including high to very high grade oxide and primary (sulphide) gold ± copper mineralisation. The vast majority of historic drilling in the area is shallow Aircore/RAB/RC in nature (generally less than 40 to 50 metres deep).Across the Minyari Dome, including locally at the Minyari and WACA deposits, highly favourable geological conditions exist for high-grade gold mineralisation, including; the domal structure itself, carbonate bearing reactive host rocks (including the Formation which hosts the Telfer deposit), excellent structural framework showing a high degree of similarity to structures which control mineralisation across the Telfer Dome and fertile granites. The Company has interpreted a Telfer style model for high-grade gold mineralisation involving blind thrust controlled enechelon high-grade gold vein and fold corridors may be applied to the Minyari Dome. These high-grade opportunities have not been not tested by drilling (although these high-grade mineralisation controls appears evident from the very limited deeper RC ± diamond drilling and also exposures within the shallow “metallurgical sampling” open pit at the Minyari deposit).​The Company has completed its validation of the historic data and technical review including the identification of significant high-grade North Telfer Project drilling targets.​Significant high grade gold (with copper) mineralisation has been identified at Minyari and WACA with strong exploration upside.
