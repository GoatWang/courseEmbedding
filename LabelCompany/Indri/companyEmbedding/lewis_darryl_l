More than 300,000 lives have been saved in the last 30 years. Florida volunteer opportunities include training to be victim advocates and helping strengthen laws.Wrongful DeathIn Wellington, an equestrian and golf community in Palm Beach County, a resident driving a golf cart with friends on board stood up to wipe moisture from the windshield while approaching a curve in the road. As she jerked the cartâ€™s steering wheel to the left, a woman passenger was thrown out of the cart and onto the paved road, where she forcefully struck her head. The passenger was evacuated by helicopter to a local hospital, where she died of her injuries a few days later.The golf cart driver and her passengers had been drinking at a Super Bowl party, and a blood test showed that the driverâ€™s blood alcohol level was almost twice the legal limit in Florida. She was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Searcy Denney attorneys Chris Searcy, Karen Terry and Brian Sullivan represented the parents of the golf cart accident victim and filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the driver and the owners of the golf cart. After a contentious, long-drawn-out process, on the eve of the scheduled trial the defendants agreed to settle the matter for $4 million.Traffic ViolationsBut more than 16% of large truck drivers in fatal crashes had at least one previous speeding conviction, about the same rate as for drivers of passenger cars.FraudThe globalization of our economy has had a tremendous impact upon corporations, often at the expense of entrepreneurs.
