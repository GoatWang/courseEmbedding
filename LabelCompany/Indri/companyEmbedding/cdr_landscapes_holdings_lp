with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on May 26, 2016 (the Original 13D and, as amended through the date hereof, the Schedule 13D). The Schedule 13D remains in full force and effect, except as
specifically amended by this Amendment No. 1. The Schedule 13D is filed by the Reporting Persons as defined in Item 2 of the Original 13D. The Schedule 13D relates to shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the Common Stock), of SiteOne
Landscape Supply, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Issuer). This Amendment No. 1 is being filed to reflect the sale of 6,753,137 shares of the Issuers Common Stock (including shares sold pursuant to the underwriters option
to purchase additional shares) by the undersigned on December 5, 2016. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Original 13D.    Item 5 Interest in Securities of the Issuer (a)  (i) CD&R Landscapes is the beneficial owner of 11,046,541 shares of the Issuers Common Stock, representing approximately 27.9% of
the Issuers Common Stock, based on 39,551,533 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on December 5, 2016.  (ii) CD&R Associates VIII, Ltd., as the general partner of CD&R Landscapes, may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common
Stock in which the CD&R Landscapes has beneficial ownership.    6  (iii) CD&R Associates VIII, L.P., as the sole stockholder of CD&R Associates VIII, Ltd.,
may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common Stock in which CD&R Landscapes has beneficial ownership.  (iv) CD&R
Investment Associates VIII, Ltd., as the general partner of CD&R Associates VIII, L.P., may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common Stock in which CD&R Landscapes has beneficial ownership.  Each of CD&R Associates VIII, Ltd., CD&R Associates VIII, L.P. and CD&R Investment Associates VIII, Ltd. expressly disclaims
beneficial ownership of the shares of the Issuers Common Stock in which CD&R Landscapes has beneficial ownership. CD&R Investment Associates VIII, Ltd. is managed by a two-person board of directors. Donald J. Gogel and Kevin J. Conway,
as the directors of CD&R Investment Associates VIII, Ltd., may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the shares of the Issuers Common Stock in which CD&R Landscapes has beneficial ownership. Such persons expressly disclaim such
beneficial ownership. Investment and voting decisions with respect to the shares of the Issuers Common Stock held by CD&R Landscapes are made by an investment committee of limited partners of CD&R Associates VIII, L.P., currently
consisting of more than ten individuals (the Investment Committee). As of the date hereof, the investment professionals who have effective voting control of the Investment Committee are Michael G. Babiarz, Vindi Banga, James G. Berges,

Nathan K. Sleeper, Sonja Terraneo and David H. Wasserman. All members of the Investment Committee expressly disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of the Issuers Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by CD&R Landscapes.  (v) By virtue of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated May 12, 2016, (the Stockholders Agreement), by and
among the Issuer, Deere and CD&R Landscapes, CD&R Landscapes and Deere may constitute a group within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). As of
the date of this filing, Deere was the beneficial owner of 5,889,341 shares of the Issuers Common Stock. As members of the group, CD&R Landscapes and Deere may be deemed to beneficially own the Issuers Common Stock beneficially owned
by the members of the group as a whole. Each of the Reporting Persons expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of the Issuers Common Stock held by Deere.  (vi) Neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be construed as an admission that any of the Reporting Persons is,
for the purpose of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, the beneficial owner of the Issuers Common Stock other than those which are directly held by CD&R Landscapes as of the date hereof.  (vii) Except as described in Sections (a)(i)  (v) of this Item 5, no other person is a beneficial owner of the Issuers Common
Stock in which CD&R Landscapes has direct beneficial ownership.  (b) In addition to the description set forth above in this Item 5(a),
see the cover pages of this Schedule 13D for indications of the respective voting powers and disposition powers of the Reporting Persons.  (c) On December 5, 2016, CD&R Landscapes sold in an underwritten secondary public offering 6,753,137 shares of the Issuers Common
Stock (including shares sold pursuant to the underwriters option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $33.00 per share.  The response to Item 6 of this Schedule 13D is incorporated herein by reference.  (d) Not applicable.  (e) Not
applicable.    7  Item 6 Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with respect to Securities of the Issuer Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement  The Stockholders Agreement grants CD&R Landscapes the right to designate for nomination for election to the Issuers board of
directors a number of CD&R designees equal to:         at least 20% of the total number of directors comprising the Issuers board of directors at such time as long as CD&R Landscapes owns at least 15% but less than 30% of the outstanding shares of the
Issuers Common Stock; and        at least 10% of the total number of directors comprising the Issuers board of directors at such time as long as CD&R Landscapes owns at least 5% but less than 15% of the outstanding shares of the Issuers
Common Stock. The Stockholders Agreement grants Deere the right to designate for nomination for election to the
Issuers board of directors a number of Deere designees equal to:         at least 10% of the total number of directors comprising the Issuers board of directors at such time as long as Deere owns at least 5% but less than 15% of the outstanding shares of the Issuers Common Stock.
For purposes of calculating the number of CD&R designees and Deere designees that the CD&R Landscapes and Deere,
respectively, are entitled to nominate pursuant to the formulas outlined above, any fractional amounts will be rounded up to the nearest whole number and the calculation will be made on a pro forma basis after taking into account any increase in the
size of the Issuers board of directors.  With respect to any vacancy of a CD&R-designated director or a Deere-designated
director, CD&R Landscapes and Deere, as applicable, will have the right to designate a new director for election by a majority of the remaining directors then in office.  The Stockholders Agreement provides that a CD&R designee will serve as the Chairman of the Issuers board of directors as long as the
CD&R Landscapes owns at least 25% of the outstanding shares of the Issuers Common Stock.  The Stockholders Agreement also grants
to CD&R Landscapes and Deere certain other rights, including specified information and access rights for CD&R Landscapes.  The
foregoing description of the Stockholders Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stockholders Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference.

the Indemnification Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference.  Lock Up Agreement  CD&R Landscapes has signed a lock-up letter agreement (the Lock-Up Agreement) under which it has agreed, subject to certain
exceptions, that, without the prior written waiver of Goldman Sachs & Co. and UBS Securities LLC, it will not, during the period ending 90 days after November 29, 2016, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make
