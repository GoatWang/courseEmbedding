Bio, Cook, Donald G.


COOK, DONALD GILBERT
Name: Donald Gilbert Cook
Rank/Branch: O3/US Marine Corps
Unit: COMMCO, 3rd Marine Division
Date of Birth: 09 August 1934 (Brooklyn NY)
Home City of Record: Essex Junction VT (also listed in some places as
New York NY and Burlington VT)
Date of Loss: 31 December 1964
Country of Loss: South Vietnam
Loss Coordinates: 104517N 1073622E (YS850900)
Status (in 1973): Prisoner of War
Category: 1
Acft/Vehicle/Ground: Ground
Refno: 0050
Other Personnel In Incident: (none missing)
REMARKS: ON PRG DIC LIST 671208
Source: Compiled from one or more of the following: raw data from U.S.
Government agency sources, correspondence with POW/MIA families,
published sources, interviews. Updated by the P.O.W. NETWORK in 2008.
SYNOPSIS: Donald Cook was an advisor to the 4th Battalion, Vietnamese Marine
Corps operating in the Delta when they engaged the enemy on New Year's Eve,
1964. Cook was wounded in the leg during the battle and subsequently captured
by the Viet Cong. Cook was then 30 years old.
During his years of captivity in camps north of Saigon, Cook set an example
difficult to emulate by his fellow POWs. He jeopardized his own health and
well-being by sharing his already meager supply of food and scarce medicines
with other prisoners who were more ill than he. According to one released POW,
Cook was so hard-nosed that he "would have stopped shitting if he had thought
Charlie was using it for fertilizer." Cook became nearly legendary in his
refusal to betray the Military Code of Conduct.
Air Force Colonel Norman Gaddis, upon his return from captivity, described the
impossible task of adhering to the Code of Conduct. Gaddis said that he did not
know anyone who had refused to cooperate with their captives after having been
tortured to do so, and those who had refused were "not with us today."
Cook refused to cooperate with his captors in any way. On one occasion, a
pistol was put to his head as a threat to cooperate. Cook calmly recited the
nomenclature of the parts of the pistol. He would give them nothing.
According to the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) list provided to
the U.S. in Paris in 1973, Donald Cook died of malaria in South Vietnam on
December 8, 1967 while being moved from one camp to another. The Vietnamese
provided this information to the U.S. in 1973, but have not yet "discovered"
the location of his remains. For his extraordinary actions during his
captivity, Donald Cook was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, and has
been promoted to the rank of Colonel. Alive or dead, Donald Cook is still a
prisoner of war.
Medal of Honor
COOK, DONALD GILBERT
Rank and organization: Colonel, United States Marine Corps. Prisoner of War
by the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam
Place and date: Vietnam, 31 December, 1964 to 8 December, 1967
Entered service at: Brooklyn, New York
Born: 9 August 1934, Brooklyn, New York
Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life
above and beyond the call of duty while interned as a Prisoner of War by the
Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 31 December 1964 to 8
December 1967. Despite the fact that by so doing he would bring about
harsher treatment for himself, Colonel (then Captain) Cook established
himself as the senior prisoner, even though in actuality he was not.
Repeatedly assuming more than his share of harsh treatment, Colonel Cook
willingly and unselfishly put the interests of his comrades before that of
his own well-being and, eventually, his life. Giving more needy men his
medicine and drug allowance while constantly nursing them, he risked
infection from contagious diseases while in a rapidly deteriorating state of
health. This unselfish and exemplary conduct, coupled with his refusal to
stray even the slightest from the Code of Conduct, earned him the deepest
respect from not only his fellow prisoners, but his captors as well. Rather
than negotiate for his own release or better treatment, he steadfastly
frustrated attempts by the Viet Cong to break his indomitable spirit, and
passed this same resolve on to the men whose well-being he so closely
associated himself. Knowing his refusals would prevent his release prior to
the end of the war, and also knowing his chances for prolonged survival
would be small in the event of continued refusal, he chose nevertheless to
adhere to a Code of Conduct far above that which could be expected. His
personal valor and exceptional spirit of loyalty in the face of almost
certain death reflected the highest credit upon Colonel Cook, the Marine
Corps. and the United States Naval Service.
 

Defense POW/MIA Weekly Update

NAVY COMMISSIONS SHIP TO HONOR POW
Aegis Guided Missile Destroyer Donald Cook (DDG 75) was commissioned in
December in Philadelphia.
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was the
ceremony's principal speaker. Laurette Cook, widow of the ship's namesake,
is the ship's sponsor. In the time-honored Navy tradition, Mrs. Cook gave
the order to "man our ship and bring her to life!"
The ship honors Col. Donald G. Cook, US Marine Corps (1934-1967), who was
posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry as a prisoner of war.
While assigned to the Communications Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd
Marine Division in Saigon, Republic of Vietnam, in Dec. 1964, Cook volunte
ered to conduct a search and recovery mission for a downed American
helicopter. Ambushed on arrival at the site, he was wounded in the leg and
captured.
Despite enduring deprivation, exposure, malnutrition and disease, Cook
committed himself to providing inspiration for his fellow prisoners to
endure and survive during his incarceration in a prison camp near the
Cambodian border. Resisting all
attempts to break his will, he never veered from the Code of Conduct. He
shared food, led daily exercises, provided first aid for injured prisoners
and distributed what meager quantities of medicine were available, often
surrendering his own rations and medicine to aid fellow prisoners whose
conditions were more serious than his own. Reports indicate Cook died in
captivity after he succumbed to malaria on Dec. 8, 1967.
Donald Cook is the 25th of 51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers currently
authorized by Congress. The destroyer carries Tomahawk cruise missiles, as
well as Standard missiles to intercept hostile aircraft and missiles at
extended ranges. Donald Cook is also equipped with the Phalanx Close-In
Weapons System and Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, which are fired from
stand-alone launchers.
Donald Cook is crewed by 25 officers and 350 enlisted personnel. The ship
was built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, is 505 feet in length, has a
waterline beam of 66 feet and displaces approximately 8,580 tons when fully
loaded. Four gas-turbine engines power the ship to speeds in excess of 30
knots.

Subject: Marine Col Donald Gilbert Cook Posthumous MOH
....  you might be interested to know that I have written a
biography about Colonel Donald Gilbert Cook. He was the first Marine
captured in Vietnam, and the first and only Marine to ever earn the Medal of
Honor in captivity. The USS DONALD COOK (DDG-75) was named in his honor. The
ship's motto epitomizes Cook's life: Faith Without Fear.

Cook was captured on December 31, 1964, while serving as an observer with
the Fourth Battalion (Killer Sharks) of Vietnamese Marines at the Battle of
Binh Gia. The Viet Cong held cook in a series of primitive jungle POW camps.
For nearly three years, Cook led ten fellow POWs in captivity, always
looking out for their health and welfare, while complying with the spirit
and intent of the Code of Conduct. He reportedly died on December 8, 1967,
on a forced march to a new camp. Cook was declared officially dead in
February 1980. His remains have never been recovered. His wife and four
children survived him, as well as seven of his former POW comrades.

Description
Colonel Donald Gilbert Cook was the first U.S. Marine captured in Vietnam;
the first and only Marine in history to earn the Medal of Honor while in
captivity; and the first Marine POW to have a U.S. Navy ship named in his
honor, the USS Donald Cook (DDG-75). On December 31, 1964, while serving as
an observer with a South Vietnamese Marine Corps battalion on a combat
operation against Viet Cong forces, he was captured near the village of Binh
Gia in South Vietnam. Until his death in captivity in December 1967, Cook
led ten POWs in a series of primitive jungle camps. His leadership and
adherence to the U.S. Military Code of Conduct earned him the nation's
highest military award, but Cook never received historical attention
commensurate with his enormous accomplishments.
This is the first book-length biography of Colonel Donald G. Cook. With
background information on Cook's life and prewar career, the book
concentrates especially on his three years in captivity, and is the first
book exclusively about a Marine POW held in South Vietnam. It covers the ten
other POWs under his command, including Sgt. Harold George Bennett (the
first American POW executed in Vietnam) and Sgt. Isaac Camacho (the first
American POW to escape in Vietnam). The author outlines the circumstances
surrounding Cook's Medal of Honor citation and death. Throughout, Cook's
adherence to the Corps' traditional leadership principles and knowledge of
the Code of Conduct are highlighted, and his biography is a unique case
study of exemplary leadership under extremely difficult conditions. Nearly
70 photographs are included.
About the Author
Retired Marine Colonel Donald L. Price earned the Silver Star, three Bronze
Stars and the Purple Heart for service in Vietnam. He lives in Sierra Vista,
Arizona.

Page ContentColonel Donald G. Cook, USMC


Bath Iron Work's fourteenth ARLEIGH BURKE Class Destroyer is named to honor Marine Corps hero Colonel Donald G. Cook for his extraordinary courage and exemplary behavior while a prisoner of war in Vietnam from 1964-1967.
Donald Cook grew up in Brooklyn, New York where he excelled at sports and earned the nickname "Bayridge Bomber" for his athletic prowess in football.  Upon graduation from St. Francis Xavier High School, he enrolled at St. Michael's College in Vermont where he flourished academically, athletically and socially.  It was there where he met his bride-to-be, Laurette Giroux.  In 1956, Cook graduated, joined the Marine Corps Reserve and married Laurette.
In 1957, Cook completed Officer Candidate School and went on to Communications Officer School.  His effectiveness in various communications roles at Camp Pendleton earned him a regular commission in the Marine Corps.  After attending the Army Intelligence School in Maryland, Cook was assigned as Officer-in-Charge of the 1st Interrogator-Translator Team with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Hawaii.  It was during this time that Cook became an expert on the affairs of American POWs in Korea, detailed the Communist indoctrination techniques and applied those techniques in realistic training scenarios for Marines.  
In December 1964, Cook was ordered to the Communications Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Marine Division in Saigon, Republic of Vietnam.  On December 31, 1964, Donald Cook volunteered to conduct a search-and-recovery mission for a downed American helicopter pilot and set off with the 4th Vietnamese Marines.  Ambushed on their arrival at the site, Cook was wounded in the leg and captured while attempting to rally his Vietnamese allies.
Incarcerated in a prison camp near the Cambodian border, Cook established himself as the senior American officer in defiance of his captor's attempts to eliminate all semblances of military rank and structure among prisoners.  Enduring deprivation, exposure, malnutrition and disease, Cook nonetheless committed himself to providing inspiration for his fellow prisoners to endure and survive.  He shared food, led daily exercises, provided first aid for injured prisoners and distributed what meager quantities of medicine were available.  He often surrendered his own rations and medicine to aid prisoners whose conditions were more desperate than his own.
It was reported in 1973 that Cook had succumbed to malaria on December 8, 1967.  On May 15, 1980, a memorial stone was placed in Arlington National Cemetery and a flag was presented to his wife Laurette.  The following day, Colonel Donald G. Cook was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  The ship's motto "Faith Without Fear" epitomizes his courage and faith in God and country.

Biography[edit]
Donald Cook was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Xavier High School in New York City and St. Michael's College in Vermont. In 1956 he enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private but was quickly sent for officer training at the OCS in Quantico, Virginia. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1957. He held a series of assignments in the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam in late 1964, where he served as an advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Division until he was wounded and captured by the Viet Cong several weeks later. He was held as a prisoner of war by the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam from December 31, 1964 until his death from malaria at age 33. He was posthumously promoted from Captain to Colonel.
Although his body was never recovered, his official memorial stone (cenotaph) can be found in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA, Memorial Section MI Lot 110.[1]

Statue of Col. Cook on the campus of St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont



For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while interned as a Prisoner of War by the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 31 December 1964 to 8 December 1967. Despite the fact that by so doing he would bring about harsher treatment for himself, Colonel (then Captain) Cook established himself as the senior prisoner, even though in actuality he was not. Repeatedly assuming more than his share of responsibility for their health, Colonel Cook willingly and unselfishly put the interests of his comrades before that of his own well-being and, eventually, his life. Giving more needy men his medicine and drug allowance while constantly nursing them, he risked infection from contagious diseases while in a rapidly deteriorating state of health. This unselfish and exemplary conduct, coupled with his refusal to stray even the slightest from the Code of Conduct, earned him the deepest respect from not only his fellow prisoners, but his captors as well. Rather than negotiate for his own release or better treatment, he steadfastly frustrated attempts by the Viet Cong to break his indomitable spirit and passed this same resolve on to the men whose well-being he so closely associated himself. Knowing his refusals would prevent his release prior to the end of the war, and also knowing his chances for prolonged survival would be small in the event of continued refusal, he chose nevertheless to adhere to a Code of Conduct far above that which could be expected. His personal valor and exceptional spirit of loyalty in the face of almost certain death reflected the highest credit upon Colonel Cook, the Marine Corps, and the United States Naval Service.

Biography[edit]
Donald Cook was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Xavier High School in New York City and St. Michael's College in Vermont. In 1956 he enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private but was quickly sent for officer training at the OCS in Quantico, Virginia. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1957. He held a series of assignments in the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam in late 1964, where he served as an advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Division until he was wounded and captured by the Viet Cong several weeks later. He was held as a prisoner of war by the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam from December 31, 1964 until his death from malaria at age 33. He was posthumously promoted from Captain to Colonel.
Although his body was never recovered, his official memorial stone (cenotaph) can be found in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA, Memorial Section MI Lot 110.[1]

Medal of Honor citation[edit]




Statue of Col. Cook on the campus of St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont



For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while interned as a Prisoner of War by the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 31 December 1964 to 8 December 1967. Despite the fact that by so doing he would bring about harsher treatment for himself, Colonel (then Captain) Cook established himself as the senior prisoner, even though in actuality he was not. Repeatedly assuming more than his share of responsibility for their health, Colonel Cook willingly and unselfishly put the interests of his comrades before that of his own well-being and, eventually, his life. Giving more needy men his medicine and drug allowance while constantly nursing them, he risked infection from contagious diseases while in a rapidly deteriorating state of health. This unselfish and exemplary conduct, coupled with his refusal to stray even the slightest from the Code of Conduct, earned him the deepest respect from not only his fellow prisoners, but his captors as well. Rather than negotiate for his own release or better treatment, he steadfastly frustrated attempts by the Viet Cong to break his indomitable spirit and passed this same resolve on to the men whose well-being he so closely associated himself. Knowing his refusals would prevent his release prior to the end of the war, and also knowing his chances for prolonged survival would be small in the event of continued refusal, he chose nevertheless to adhere to a Code of Conduct far above that which could be expected. His personal valor and exceptional spirit of loyalty in the face of almost certain death reflected the highest credit upon Colonel Cook, the Marine Corps, and the United States Naval Service.

Legacy[edit]
The United States Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) is named in his honor.[2]
Cook Hall at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center, Presidio of Monterey, in Monterey, California, is named after Donald Cook, who graduated from the school's Chinese Mandarin course in May 1961. Cook Hall was dedicated in late 2014 and is the largest and most modern academic building of the DLIFLC campus.[3]
Colonel Donald G. Cook is honored with a 'Freedom Tree' on the Vermont State House lawn.[4]
Colonel Donald G. Cook Chapter 5 Disabled American Veterans (DAV) of Burlington, Vermont is named in his honor. Col. Donald G. Cook Chapter 5 DAV assists veterans in obtaining compensation for their service-connected disabilities, raises funds to support the DAV travel service for disabled veterans to the White River Junction, Vermont Veterans Hospital, and generally serves the needs of disabled Veterans in Burlington and the surrounding areas.
Saint Michael's College bestows the Colonel Donald G. Cook '56 Award to alumni for unselfish service to others. It is the College’s most prestigious alumni award.[5]
The Colonel Donald G. Cook award is presented to a United States Marine Corps active duty (officer or enlisted) or Government Civilian intelligence professional to recognize professional excellence and exceptional dedication to duty in Marine Corps Intelligence. Annually presented, the award is sponsored by the National Military Intelligence Association (NMIA).[6]
