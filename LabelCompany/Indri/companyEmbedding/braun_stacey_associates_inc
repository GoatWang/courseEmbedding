Titanium Coating
Intelligent Sonic Technology


The obvious first: All Braun shavers go in straight lines, not in circles as you might know it from rotary shavers. We consider this shaving movement more intuitive and efficient. Test by an independent institute prove e.g. that Series 9 captures more hair in one stroke than any other shaver*.
Furthermore, Braun‘s Series 9 and Series 7 are the world‘s only shavers with intelligent Sonic Technology that 160 times per minute read and automatically adapt to the densitity of your beard. The shaver provides extra power exactly where you need it for fewer strokes and a more personalized shave.

Closeness & skin comfort
Fewer strokes minimize the risk of skin irritation, it‘s that simple. That‘s why many men with sensitive skin chose the efficiency of a Braun electric shaver.
For ultimate skin protection, Braun puts an ultra-thin foil between your skin and the super-sharp blades. Each foil comes with a unique pattern of 1,064 ergonomically formed holes that captures each hair in the perfect angle. This way, you get the long-lasting closeness you want without your skin ever making direct contact with the blades.











Gentleness

Braun shavers (Series 3 and above) have pressure sensitive blades that perfectly adapt to your skin. The premium models (Series 5 and above) also come with a dynamic flexible head that keeps maximum contact along facial contours.

















Wet or dry shaving experience


Some men told us that they prefer using their electric shaver with water, foam or gel for better gliding and a refreshing skin experience. That‘s why most Braun shavers are „Wet&Dry“, easily recognizable by the icon on pack or the model name.
This gives you the ultimate choice to shave with any method you want. By the way: All Braun shavers are 100% waterproof up to 5 meters, so you can perfectly rinse and clean them under running water.
















Perfect ergonomics

Braun Series shaver were designed to fit your hand naturally and intuitively. The ergonomic, curved shape and the perfect positioning of the interface touch points allow best handling in every situation.











Easy maintenance

Whilst every Braun shaver is fully washable under running water, our proprietary Clean&Charge Station automatically maintains your shaver at its maximum performance. Using a Braun Clean&Charge Station is in fact 10 times more hygienic than simply under tap water, and your shaver feels and smells like new every day.

                            The Braun Series 9 can be submerged in up to 5 meter deep water. Which means it is fully washable and you can comfortably rinse it under running water for easy cleaning.
                        

























                    Use Wet&Dry or in the shower.

                            For Braun, good design is so much more than what meets the eye. Every detail matters and forms a perfect fusion of form and function to create the best shaving experience for many years in use:  ergonomics, materials, surfaces, interfaces. Like the textured MultiHeadLock switch that provides an ideal grip position for your thumb during shaving.

Discover Braun’s step by step guide and learn how to look after your shaver using Braun Clean and Renew. Find out how to professionally clean it yourself!












1. Professional cleaning
New shaver feeling at the touch of a button 
Some Braun Series shaver models come with a Clean&Charge cleaning device. So you just push a button, and it cleans, dries and recharges your shaver automatically. So easy and absolutely hygienic.

2. Manually cleaning
Rinsing under running hot water
Almost every Braun shaver can be rinsed quickly and easily under running hot water. The cleaning effect can be improved by using a bit of standard liquid soap. And another tip: to give your shaver optimal care, you should put a drop of oil on the cutter block once in a while.














Cleaning with the brush
After removing the cutter head, the cutter block is easy to clean with the brush. When you’re done, switch the shaver on fort wo or three seconds. Careful: Never, ever clean the cutter foil with the brush. 




Cleaning with the cleaning spray
The cleaning spray helps clean your shaver thoroughly, removing all traces of sebum. After spraying both cutter parts, the soaked residues are easy to remove.














3. Maintaining
For 100% performance, replace all cutter parts every 18 months
After 18 months, you have shaved as many hairs as there are blades of grass on a soccer field! So it`s definitely high time to replace the cutter parts for your shaver to deliver 100% performance again. Since the cutter foil and cutter operate like the two parts of a pair of scissors, they inevitably wear out after so much high performance.

Investment Education vs. Comprehensive Investment Advice

We act as a Financial “Coach” to Participants
No financial products are sold

Advice is unbiased, objective and customized specifically for the member
Consultations are performed by a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) from Stacey Braun Associates, Inc. only
Consultations are held locally at Employer Facilities or a convenient agreed upon location
Personalized service is more effective than computer models and generic material containing investment jargon.
The program is designed to establish long-term relationships between participants and CFP’s or RIA’s with whom they meet. Participants are encouraged to contact their CFP/RIA with any follow-up questions, particularly as their financial situation changes or in response to implementing the advice the receive.


The Stacey Braun Defined Contribution Financial Planning Program

As mentioned above, our programs can be customized to the fit the needs of any employer.  Programs can be offered and paid for in variety of manners. Often, employers will attach one of our financial planning programs to a defined contribution plan. Our programs are a great compliment to a retirement program because they provide comprehensive investment advice.  Comprehensive investment advice is superior to the basic investment education feature included, but under-used in most defined contribution plans.
The basic education feature is usually designed solely to satisfy DOL education requirements which means that education is limited, formula driven and does not consider the particular financial situation of the individual.


Investment Education vs. Comprehensive Investment Advice


Investment Education
Comprehensive Investment Advice


General investment education, materials and plan information
Personalized investment advice and education


General asset allocation models
Customized asset allocation development


Tailored to group
Tailored to the individual


May not review/consider other financial matters
Other financial matters reviewed and considered


Generic Seminars
Multiple seminars, multiple individual consultations and ongoing assistance


A major goal of any of our Corporate Financial Planning Programs is to assist employees in using their qualified retirement plans effectively in conjunction with their personal financial objectives and employer benefits.
Please contact us for additional information.



Individual Investment Management
Individual Investment Management
In 2001, Stacey Braun created a “boutique” financial planning and investment division that is staffed with Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), Certified Financial Planners (CFP) and Enrolled Agents (EA) to assist you with our comprehensive approach to investment planning and to provide you with a wide array of financial services.


Investment Philosophy
Stacey Braun considers a client’s complete financial situation in order to construct a comprehensive investment strategy. We develop a portfolio for each client based upon their tolerance for risk, investment timeframe, cash flow needs, tax considerations and overall financial goals.
Each portfolio is tailored to the individual in accordance with their financial goals. We do not use model portfolios commonly sold through brokerage firms. Accounts are reviewed daily and changes are made to the accounts periodically based on market dynamics, fund performance, account re-balancing and changes to an individual’s goals. We have access to thousands of mutual funds, equities, exchange-traded funds (ETF’s), government and agency securities, corporate/government/municipal bonds and REIT’s that can be used to build a diversified portfolio.
Our personalized approach allows clients to have direct access to their portfolio manager and a Certified Financial Planner is available to address financial matters that a client may have.


Investments
Stacey Braun attempts to achieve strong investment performance through proper diversification of portfolio assets. Through our institutional relationship with Charles Schwab & Company (custodian), we have access to low cost, load-waived and institutional investments, some of which are not available to the general public without commisions. Listed below are some of the fund families and investments that might be used by Stacey Braun in the management of individual accounts.

Personalized Service
Our personalized service sets us apart from other investment management firms – whether it’s a large brokerage house or a local mutual fund salesman.
Our comprehensive approach to asset management seeks to ensure that each account is invested according to a client’s specific needs and is in accordance with their entire financial situation. We are always available to discuss our clients’ accounts and other financial concerns that arise. Our “small company” atmosphere fosters low turnover amongst our portfolio managers and financial advisors and emphasizes client satisfaction.


Fee Based
Stacey Braun follows a fee-based approach to asset management which benefits clients in the following manner:

No Conflict of Interest – We are not paid by any investment company or based upon frequency of trades;  we can objectively construct a portfolio that’s appropriate for each client.


No Commissions – No brokerage commissions are paid to, or accepted by, Stacey Braun Associates, Inc.


No Deferred Sales Charges – The investment products we select do not carry deferred sales charges.  Investments are liquid and can be sold at any time (a 90-day short–term redemption fee may be applied by some mutual funds).


No Time Commitments – The contract between the client and Stacey Braun can be terminated at any time upon client request.

Financial Planning Programs: Unions
Why do members need financial planning?

Everyone can benefit from financial planning. In our experience union members utilize our services because

They are unsure if they have enough money for retirement
They have excessive debt or live paycheck to paycheck
They are not sure if they are invested properly or how to invest according to their individual financial circumstance
They have questions regarding their taxes
They do not know if they have adequate or appropriate insurance
They are not properly utilizing their employer and/or union benefits
They are purchasing a home or other large asset
They want to rollover their retirement account
They want to learn about options regarding long-term care
They are unaware of education funding methods
They have financial questions and don’t know who to ask



Stacey Braun offers two types of Financial Planning Programs for Unions, General Programs and Retirement Plan Programs. Both Programs are designed to offer objective financial planning advice directly to the member (and the member’s family, if so requested) by a Certified Financial Planner® and/or Registered Investment Advisor.  Both can also be modified to suit the particular needs of the Union.

Financial Planning Programs: Corporations
FINANCIAL PLANNING PROGRAMS: CORPORATIONS

Stacey Braun’s Corporate Financial Planning Program is a comprehensive service built around:

Investment Advice
Financial Planning
Benefit Coordination



An employee who is not distracted by his or her financial situation is a more productive employee:Employees experiencing financial stress spent 13% of the workday dealing with money matters while on the job— Consumer Credit Counseling Service

When you consider:Almost 2/3 (61%) of Americans report having serious financial problems— Kaiser Family Foundation
56% of those surveyed report that stress related to finances has increased in the last 12 months— PwC Financial Wellness Survey
50% of people age 45 and up have not calculated their retirement savings need— Wall Street Journal
It should come as no surprise that:Employees are increasingly interested in professional advice regarding critical decisions about their retirement savings (49%), overall financial situation (44%) and their benefits (47%)— Met Life Study of Employee Benefits Trends



Stacey Braun’s financial planning programs for corporations are designed to assist employees with their financial decisions and objectives while insuring that they utilize employer provided benefits optimally.
Our programs can be customized to the fit the needs of any employer.  The following are features contained in our programs:
Financial Planning Topics Covered

Retirement Planning
Debt Management/Budgeting
Education Planning (529 Plans)
Estate/Inheritance Planning
Financial Advice on Divorce Matters
Life, Disability, Health and Long-Term Care Insurance
Tax Planning
Home Purchase/Financing

Participant will be educated on available benefits
Assist with employee on-boarding and explanation of benefits
Provide terminated employees financial assistance upon layoffs or downsizing
Provide tax guidance with respect to qualified retirement plans, qualified/non-qualified stock options and executive compensation arrangements



Investment Education vs. Comprehensive Investment Advice

We act as a Financial “Coach” to Participants
No financial products are sold
Participants are entitled to a free, annual and confidential one-on-one professional consultation
Advice is unbiased, objective and customized specifically for the member
Consultations are performed by a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) from Stacey Braun Associates, Inc. only
Consultations are held locally at Employer Facilities or a convenient agreed upon location
Personalized service is more effective than computer models and generic material containing investment jargon.
The program is designed to establish long-term relationships between participants and CFP’s or RIA’s with whom they meet. Participants are encouraged to contact their CFP/RIA with any follow-up questions, particularly as their financial situation changes or in response to implementing the advice the receive.


The Stacey Braun Defined Contribution Financial Planning Program

As mentioned above, our programs can be customized to the fit the needs of any employer.  Programs can be offered and paid for in variety of manners. Often, employers will attach one of our financial planning programs to a defined contribution plan. Our programs are a great compliment to a retirement program because they provide comprehensive investment advice.  Comprehensive investment advice is superior to the basic investment education feature included, but under-used in most defined contribution plans.
The basic education feature is usually designed solely to satisfy DOL education requirements which means that education is limited, formula driven and does not consider the particular financial situation of the individual.


Investment Education vs. Comprehensive Investment Advice


Investment Education
Comprehensive Investment Advice


General investment education, materials and plan information
Personalized investment advice and education


General asset allocation models
Customized asset allocation development


Tailored to group
Tailored to the individual


May not review/consider other financial matters
Other financial matters reviewed and considered


Generic Seminars
Multiple seminars, multiple individual consultations and ongoing assistance


A major goal of any of our Corporate Financial Planning Programs is to assist employees in using their qualified retirement plans effectively in conjunction with their personal financial objectives and employer benefits.
Please contact us for additional information.



Individual Investment Management
Individual Investment Management
In 2001, Stacey Braun created a “boutique” financial planning and investment division that is staffed with Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), Certified Financial Planners (CFP) and Enrolled Agents (EA) to assist you with our comprehensive approach to investment planning and to provide you with a wide array of financial services.


Investment Philosophy
Stacey Braun considers a client’s complete financial situation in order to construct a comprehensive investment strategy. We develop a portfolio for each client based upon their tolerance for risk, investment timeframe, cash flow needs, tax considerations and overall financial goals.
Each portfolio is tailored to the individual in accordance with their financial goals. We do not use model portfolios commonly sold through brokerage firms. Accounts are reviewed daily and changes are made to the accounts periodically based on market dynamics, fund performance, account re-balancing and changes to an individual’s goals. We have access to thousands of mutual funds, equities, exchange-traded funds (ETF’s), government and agency securities, corporate/government/municipal bonds and REIT’s that can be used to build a diversified portfolio.
Our personalized approach allows clients to have direct access to their portfolio manager and a Certified Financial Planner is available to address financial matters that a client may have.


Investments
Stacey Braun attempts to achieve strong investment performance through proper diversification of portfolio assets. Through our institutional relationship with Charles Schwab & Company (custodian), we have access to low cost, load-waived and institutional investments, some of which are not available to the general public without commisions. Listed below are some of the fund families and investments that might be used by Stacey Braun in the management of individual accounts.

Personalized Service
Our personalized service sets us apart from other investment management firms – whether it’s a large brokerage house or a local mutual fund salesman.
Our comprehensive approach to asset management seeks to ensure that each account is invested according to a client’s specific needs and is in accordance with their entire financial situation. We are always available to discuss our clients’ accounts and other financial concerns that arise. Our “small company” atmosphere fosters low turnover amongst our portfolio managers and financial advisors and emphasizes client satisfaction.


Fee Based
Stacey Braun follows a fee-based approach to asset management which benefits clients in the following manner:

No Conflict of Interest – We are not paid by any investment company or based upon frequency of trades;  we can objectively construct a portfolio that’s appropriate for each client.


No Commissions – No brokerage commissions are paid to, or accepted by, Stacey Braun Associates, Inc.


No Deferred Sales Charges – The investment products we select do not carry deferred sales charges.  Investments are liquid and can be sold at any time (a 90-day short–term redemption fee may be applied by some mutual funds).


No Time Commitments – The contract between the client and Stacey Braun can be terminated at any time upon client request.


Why Stacey Braun?

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Discover Braun’s step by step guide and learn how to look after your shaver using Braun Clean and Renew. Find out how to professionally clean it yourself!












1. Professional cleaning
New shaver feeling at the touch of a button 
Some Braun Series shaver models come with a Clean&Charge cleaning device. So you just push a button, and it cleans, dries and recharges your shaver automatically. So easy and absolutely hygienic.
Learn more about Braun’s Clean&Charge Station












2. Manually cleaning
Rinsing under running hot water
Almost every Braun shaver can be rinsed quickly and easily under running hot water. The cleaning effect can be improved by using a bit of standard liquid soap. And another tip: to give your shaver optimal care, you should put a drop of oil on the cutter block once in a while.














Cleaning with the brush
After removing the cutter head, the cutter block is easy to clean with the brush. When you’re done, switch the shaver on fort wo or three seconds. Careful: Never, ever clean the cutter foil with the brush. 




Cleaning with the cleaning spray
The cleaning spray helps clean your shaver thoroughly, removing all traces of sebum. After spraying both cutter parts, the soaked residues are easy to remove.














3. Maintaining
For 100% performance, replace all cutter parts every 18 months
After 18 months, you have shaved as many hairs as there are blades of grass on a soccer field! So it`s definitely high time to replace the cutter parts for your shaver to deliver 100% performance again. Since the cutter foil and cutter operate like the two parts of a pair of scissors, they inevitably wear out after so much high performance.

                            The Braun Series 9 can be submerged in up to 5 meter deep water. Which means it is fully washable and you can comfortably rinse it under running water for easy cleaning.
                        

























                    Use Wet&Dry or in the shower.

                            For Braun, good design is so much more than what meets the eye. Every detail matters and forms a perfect fusion of form and function to create the best shaving experience for many years in use:  ergonomics, materials, surfaces, interfaces. Like the textured MultiHeadLock switch that provides an ideal grip position for your thumb during shaving.

                            Stacey Braun Associates Inc. is an investment advisory company that was established in 1977, and provides 
                            asset management
                            and financial planning services 
                            to institutions and individuals.
                        

Stacey Braun Associates, Inc. was founded in 1977 for the primary purpose of providing asset management services to labor-management pension funds, union and corporate organizations as well as individuals. In 1977 Stacey Braun’s assets under management totaled approximately $60 million. Today, the Firm manages over $3.5 billion. Since we do not advertise our growth has been derived from investment manager searches and referrals based upon the Company’s investment performance.
Stacey Braun is a Registered Investment Advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended and accepts designation as a fiduciary under ERISA. The firm specializes in separate account management.
In 2001, our Financial Planning Division was created in response to a need for objective programs that would help the employees and union members of our institutional clients better comprehend their personal finances and help them attain their financial goals. A founding concept was that these services would be offered in an unbiased fashion and without sales pressure. Twelve years later, our Financial Planning Programs are available to over 600,000 participants in the tri-state area.
The growth of this division, as well as the multitude of positive evaluations we have received from participants speaks to the effectiveness and popularity of our financial planning programs.
Stacey Braun is an independent, employee owned business with no affiliations to other companies.
