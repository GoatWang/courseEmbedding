Casoro CapitalNewsAnnouncementsCasoro Capital announces start of $50M real estate fund


 Casoro Capital announces start of $50M real estate fund

					By Jessica Lee-Wen on March 30, 2015 				



Casoro Capital has announced the launch of a private equity real estate fund today. Casoro is looking to raise $50M for Casoro Capital Real Estate Fund I, LP. This fund will focus on the Texas multifamily market, particularly in Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston. The fund targets high net worth, family offices, and institutions.
Casoro Capital is a new Private Equity company recently formed by Austin-based real estate company, The PPA Group. The new firm will concentrate on developing and raising money for discretionary multifamily real estate funds that are attractive for high net worth individuals, family offices, and institutions.
The company has been met with a lot of positive feedback and interest by the industry.
“Being born out of an operations company will set us apart,” says Casoro Capital’s Principal and The PPA Group’s President and CEO, Monte K. Lee-Wen. “Because we are vertically integrated, we will be able to financially underwrite investment opportunities more thoroughly.”
The new company will leverage their financial expertise and operational experience in acquiring and repositioning multifamily properties below replacement cost with upside potential within what they call their “local” markets. The advantage of becoming knowledge experts in specific markets (what they call their local markets) is that they know the smallest details about the area which benefits everyone throughout the investment process.
The limited partnership interests in Casoro Capital Real Estate Fund I, LP (the “Fund”) are offered under a separate private offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any State’s securities laws, and are sold for investment only pursuant to an exemption from registration with the SEC and in compliance with any applicable state or other securities laws. The information set forth herein does not purport to be complete and no obligation to update or otherwise revise such information is being assumed. It is meant to be read in conjunction with the Fund’s Offering Memorandum and does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, by anyone in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized or in which the making of such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Please refer to the Fund’s full legal disclaimer here.
