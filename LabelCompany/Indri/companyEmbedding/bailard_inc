Morningstar Ratings metrics. Morningstar Ratings are based solely on a proprietary mathematical formula based on measures of risk and performance that it recalculates each month. The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.

Company Name: Bailard Inc.
Location: Foster City, CA
Nature of Business: Financial advisory
Founded: 1969
Revenue: $16.9 million
Number of Employees: 49
Average Tenure: 13 years
Established in 1969, Bailard is the product of three graduates of the Stanford business school who formed one of the first fee-only financial planning practices in the country. Now with 49 employees, the firm offers Wealth Management, Institutional Equity Strategies and Alternative Investments, and is lauded by clients for their straight-forward, honest and responsive approach. The firm has built its culture by creating an environment of open communication, trust, integrity and a focus on doing the right thing, which they say “eliminates the conflict between an employee’s desire to do well and the desire to do good”. Despite a disastrous turn in the industry in 2008, Bailard has remained profitable, retaining generous benefits even for part-time staff and boasting an average advisory client retention rate of 98% for the past five years. Their diverse staff maintains an average tenure of 13 years and has worked together to avoid lay-offs during tough times, with leadership taking steep cuts in compensation and general staff sharing lighter cutbacks. Having successfully transitioned from a founder/owner model to a management model in the late 80’s, the firm named a 24-year employee CEO in 2008, and has focused on its long-term health by intentionally developing promising junior employees for future leadership opportunities.
