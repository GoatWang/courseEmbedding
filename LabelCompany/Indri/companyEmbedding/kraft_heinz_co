        2 Things That Could Bring the Kraft-Heinz Company Down
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Billy Duberstein)

        Updated 7 hrs ago





























































































To investors, the Kraft-Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) may seem like a can't-miss investment: A portfolio of beloved household brands, huge scale, and top-notch management in 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B), which combined own about 50% of the company.However, even Buffett himself said in his 1987 shareholder letter, "When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact." 
Right now, the consumer-packaged goods business is facing several structural headwinds, and even Kraft-Heinz is not immune, posting a 3.1% year-over-year sales decline in the first quarter. Here are two big dangers Kraft-Heinz shareholders need to be aware of.Image source: Getty Images.Grocery consolidationLarge consumer packaged goods companies mostly sell through brick-and-mortar retailers. Often, profit sharing between producer and distributor is determined through delicate negotiations. Thus, if a retailer has sufficient scale, it can afford to be a tough negotiator and drive supplier prices down. This is how Wal-Mart Stores was able to become a very profitable business while also maintaining a reputation for rock-bottom prices.In this light, the ongoing price war in the grocery business combined with Amazon's recent buyout of Whole Foods is likely to spur much greater consolidation in a fragmented U.S. grocery industry. On a recent conference call, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen stated, "Everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out."This is not good for Kraft-Heinz. First, an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could result in Amazon bringing Whole Foods' prices from "Whole Paycheck" levels down closer to those of consumer packaged goods brands.Second, consolidation could very well mean Kraft-Heinz will be weakened in producer-distributor negotiations. For instance, consumer packaged goods companies often get preferred shelf placements and end caps due to their ability to pay slotting fees, pay-to-stay fees, and display fees to grocery stores. If you have, say, the scale of Wal-Mart (25% market share -- by far the largest player), you are likely able to negotiate higher fees (or bigger discounts) for access to your large store base.While Kraft-Heinz is a global company, it still gets almost 80% of its sales from the U.S. and Canada, where consolidation is likely to happen. That could be why the company has been trying so hard to purchase Unilever (NYSE: UN), which is much more globally diversified, getting only 17% of its sales from North America. Private label's rise
Another trend threatening Kraft-Heinz's franchise is the rise of private-label brands. Private-label brands are owned by the retailers themselves, such as Costco's Kirkland, Kroger's Simple Truth, and Whole Foods' 365 Everyday. Retailers often give these brands prime placement on their own store shelves, while pricing them far below big-name brands. Since retailers don't need to spend vast sums on marketing and display fees as large consumer packaged goods companies do, these brands are still very profitable despite their bargain prices.Since the Great Recession, cost-conscious customers have been turning increasingly to private labels. Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow estimates private label sales have increased 3.5% annually since 2012, taking market share from the rest of the industry. Moreover, the percentage of consumers who can name a favorite brand has declined, with the age of transparency enabling customers to seek out products based on ingredients and benefits, according to a 2015 Time, Inc./Yougov study. As such, many consumers are simply turning to the cheapest selection, which is usually a private label. A dangerous comboPutting these two trends together -- the consolidation of grocery retailers, all with their own private labels -- is a potentially dangerous mix for Kraft Heinz. To combat these headwinds, the company is turning to innovation to keep customers interested, including removing nitrates from Oscar Meyer hot dogs and artificial dyes from Kraft's classic macaroni and cheese. The company has also launched new products, such as Heinz Seriously Good Sauces, Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, and Devour frozen dinners, which the company claims are performing very well.
Still, with the company posting year-over-year sales declines, it remains to be seen if these new innovations can offset declines in legacy brands and these two large headwinds. While the company is in good hands, Kraft-Heinz investors should still proceed with caution.10 stocks we like better than The Kraft Heinz CompanyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        2 Things That Could Bring the Kraft-Heinz Company Down
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Billy Duberstein)

            Jul 24, 2017
        Updated 8 hrs ago





























































































To investors, the Kraft-Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC) may seem like a can't-miss investment: A portfolio of beloved household brands, huge scale, and top-notch management in 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B), which combined own about 50% of the company.However, even Buffett himself said in his 1987 shareholder letter, "When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact." 
Right now, the consumer-packaged goods business is facing several structural headwinds, and even Kraft-Heinz is not immune, posting a 3.1% year-over-year sales decline in the first quarter. Here are two big dangers Kraft-Heinz shareholders need to be aware of.Image source: Getty Images.Grocery consolidationLarge consumer packaged goods companies mostly sell through brick-and-mortar retailers. Often, profit sharing between producer and distributor is determined through delicate negotiations. Thus, if a retailer has sufficient scale, it can afford to be a tough negotiator and drive supplier prices down. This is how Wal-Mart Stores was able to become a very profitable business while also maintaining a reputation for rock-bottom prices.In this light, the ongoing price war in the grocery business combined with Amazon's recent buyout of Whole Foods is likely to spur much greater consolidation in a fragmented U.S. grocery industry. On a recent conference call, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen stated, "Everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out."This is not good for Kraft-Heinz. First, an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could result in Amazon bringing Whole Foods' prices from "Whole Paycheck" levels down closer to those of consumer packaged goods brands.Second, consolidation could very well mean Kraft-Heinz will be weakened in producer-distributor negotiations. For instance, consumer packaged goods companies often get preferred shelf placements and end caps due to their ability to pay slotting fees, pay-to-stay fees, and display fees to grocery stores. If you have, say, the scale of Wal-Mart (25% market share -- by far the largest player), you are likely able to negotiate higher fees (or bigger discounts) for access to your large store base.While Kraft-Heinz is a global company, it still gets almost 80% of its sales from the U.S. and Canada, where consolidation is likely to happen. That could be why the company has been trying so hard to purchase Unilever (NYSE: UN), which is much more globally diversified, getting only 17% of its sales from North America. Private label's rise
Another trend threatening Kraft-Heinz's franchise is the rise of private-label brands. Private-label brands are owned by the retailers themselves, such as Costco's Kirkland, Kroger's Simple Truth, and Whole Foods' 365 Everyday. Retailers often give these brands prime placement on their own store shelves, while pricing them far below big-name brands. Since retailers don't need to spend vast sums on marketing and display fees as large consumer packaged goods companies do, these brands are still very profitable despite their bargain prices.Since the Great Recession, cost-conscious customers have been turning increasingly to private labels. Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow estimates private label sales have increased 3.5% annually since 2012, taking market share from the rest of the industry. Moreover, the percentage of consumers who can name a favorite brand has declined, with the age of transparency enabling customers to seek out products based on ingredients and benefits, according to a 2015 Time, Inc./Yougov study. As such, many consumers are simply turning to the cheapest selection, which is usually a private label. A dangerous comboPutting these two trends together -- the consolidation of grocery retailers, all with their own private labels -- is a potentially dangerous mix for Kraft Heinz. To combat these headwinds, the company is turning to innovation to keep customers interested, including removing nitrates from Oscar Meyer hot dogs and artificial dyes from Kraft's classic macaroni and cheese. The company has also launched new products, such as Heinz Seriously Good Sauces, Cracker Barrel Mac & Cheese, and Devour frozen dinners, which the company claims are performing very well.
Still, with the company posting year-over-year sales declines, it remains to be seen if these new innovations can offset declines in legacy brands and these two large headwinds. While the company is in good hands, Kraft-Heinz investors should still proceed with caution.10 stocks we like better than The Kraft Heinz CompanyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

                The History Behind Kraft Heinz Co.            


    By Rebecca McClay | Updated July 19, 2017 — 11:04 AM EDT    






Share





















































Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC), now the fifth-largest food and beverage company worldwide, is the result of decades of takeovers in a growth strategy that shows no signs of slowing.
Most recently, the food products giant has had Unilever plc (UL) in its acquisition crosshairs. Kraft Heinz failed to takeover Unilever with a $143 billion bid in February, but some analysts say it will likely return soon with a sweetened bid of up to $200 billion. (For more, see also: 6 Companies Kraft Heinz Could Swallow Up Next.)
Now with more than 200 household brands under its umbrella, Kraft Heinz has roots that date back to the late 1800s through its Pittsburgh-based Heinz line, and back to the early 1900s through its Chicago-based Kraft line. The two companies merged in 2015, in a massive deal spurred on by 3G Capital and Berkshire after decades of absorbing brands like Nabisco, Post and Oscar Mayer.
Heinz Began With Ketchup
The H.J. Heinz Company was founded by American entrepreneur Henry John Heinz, son of German immigrants. He began a small food business with his brother and cousin in 1876. Heinz Tomato Ketchup was among the company’s first products, and it is now Heinz’s most iconic brand, claiming more than 50% of the market share for ketchup in the U.S.
Heinz eventually bought out his partners and established the H. J. Heinz Co. in 1888. That company was incorporated in 1905 with Heinz serving as the first president, a position he held throughout his life as he built more than 20 processing plants throughout the country.
During the Great Depression in the 1930s, Heinz became a top-seller in ready-to-eat meals and baby food under the leadership of Howard Heinz, Henry Heinz's son. During World War Two, Heinz provided food aid to the United Kingdom and then expanded its international presence with new plants in several countries in the post-war years.




Over the next few decades, Heinz continued to grow with brand acquisitions like Starkist Tuna and Ore-Ida until Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital bought the company for $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, the investors pursued the massive merger with Kraft Foods Group. (For more, see also: Why Kraft Heinz Will Be a Winner Long-Term.)
Kraft Started With Cheese
Kraft’s origins began with Canadian immigrant James L. Kraft, who started a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago with his brothers. They incorporated it in 1909. By 1914, J.L. Kraft and Bros. Company was selling 31 varieties of cheese, and in 1916 it patented a pasteurized processed cheese that gave cheese a longer shelf life.
Meanwhile, a company called National Dairy Products Corporation was aggressively acquiring dozens of small dairy products companies throughout the U.S., and eventually snapped up Kraft in 1930. National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corp. in 1969.
Phillip Morris Companies then acquired Kraft in 1988 after taking over General Foods in 1985. Philip Morris then acquired Nabisco Holdings in 2000 and integrated the companies into Kraft General Foods, which it began to sell off in 2007. Through the share sales, Kraft Foods Inc. became a fully independent public corporation.
As its own company, Kraft Foods continued an aggressive streak of mergers, buying French biscuit company Groupe Danone for $7 billion in 2007 and British candy company Cadbury for more than $19 billion in 2010. Then in 2012, Kraft Foods divided into two: a U.S. grocery products company called Kraft Foods Group Inc. and an international snacks company called Mondelez International.
Kraft Foods Group produced brands like Oscar Mayer, Oreo, Philadelphia cream cheese, Tang and Maxwell House among many others. It was an independent public company listed on the Nasdaq exchange for about four years before merging with H.J. Heinz Company in 2015, creating the third-largest U.S. foods company. (For more, see also: Unilever Earnings Guide Way for Kraft Heinz.)
Today's Kraft Heinz Co. holds more than 200 iconic brands that together draw in about $26.5 billion in annual net sales. Among them: Heinz, Kraft, Jell-O, Velveeta, Kool-Aid and Lunchables. Kraft shares are down 3% year to date, and down 5.7% the past year.

During World War Two, Heinz provided food aid to the United Kingdom and then expanded its international presence with new plants in several countries in the post-war years.




Over the next few decades, Heinz continued to grow with brand acquisitions like Starkist Tuna and Ore-Ida until Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital bought the company for $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, the investors pursued the massive merger with Kraft Foods Group. (For more, see also: Why Kraft Heinz Will Be a Winner Long-Term.)
Kraft Started With Cheese
Kraft’s origins began with Canadian immigrant James L. Kraft, who started a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago with his brothers. They incorporated it in 1909. By 1914, J.L. Kraft and Bros. Company was selling 31 varieties of cheese, and in 1916 it patented a pasteurized processed cheese that gave cheese a longer shelf life.
Meanwhile, a company called National Dairy Products Corporation was aggressively acquiring dozens of small dairy products companies throughout the U.S., and eventually snapped up Kraft in 1930. National Dairy changed its name to Kraftco Corp. in 1969.
Phillip Morris Companies then acquired Kraft in 1988 after taking over General Foods in 1985. Philip Morris then acquired Nabisco Holdings in 2000 and integrated the companies into Kraft General Foods, which it began to sell off in 2007. Through the share sales, Kraft Foods Inc. became a fully independent public corporation.
As its own company, Kraft Foods continued an aggressive streak of mergers, buying French biscuit company Groupe Danone for $7 billion in 2007 and British candy company Cadbury for more than $19 billion in 2010. Then in 2012, Kraft Foods divided into two: a U.S. grocery products company called Kraft Foods Group Inc. and an international snacks company called Mondelez International.
Kraft Foods Group produced brands like Oscar Mayer, Oreo, Philadelphia cream cheese, Tang and Maxwell House among many others. It was an independent public company listed on the Nasdaq exchange for about four years before merging with H.J. Heinz Company in 2015, creating the third-largest U.S. foods company.

Today's Kraft Heinz Co. holds more than 200 iconic brands that together draw in about $26.5 billion in annual net sales. Among them: Heinz, Kraft, Jell-O, Velveeta, Kool-Aid and Lunchables. Kraft shares are down 3% year to date, and down 5.7% the past year.

The Kraft Heinz Company is an American food company formed by the merger of Kraft Foods Group and Heinz in 2015.[3] The merger was backed by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, which invested US$10 billion in the deal, making Kraft Heinz worth about US$46 billion.[4][5] In 2015, the Kraft Heinz Company had 13 different brands with $500 million or more each in annual sales.[6]

Merger[edit]
The merger was agreed by the boards of both companies, with approval by shareholders (at the shareholders meeting) and regulatory authorities.[3][6] The new company became the world's fifth-largest food and beverage company[7] and the third-largest in the US.[3] The company is headquartered in both Pittsburgh and Chicago.[8] The companies completed the merger on July 2, 2015.[1]
Under the merger, Kraft's shareholders received 49% of shares in the combined company, plus a one-time dividend of US$16.50 per share.[9] Fortune reports that sluggish growth for Kraft in the US market is due to consumers turning to natural and organic ingredients.[10]
Alex Behring, 3G Capital's managing partner, is the chairman of the new company; Bernardo Hees, also a partner of 3G Capital and Heinz's chief executive officer (CEO), is the CEO of the new company; and John Cahill, Kraft's CEO, is the vice chairman of the new company.[10]
The merger did not affect the naming rights to Heinz Field, home of the Pittsburgh Steelers.[11]
On February 17, 2017, it was reported that Kraft Heinz Co. had made a $143 billion approach to take over the British-Dutch multinational Unilever, a significantly larger competitor with 126,000 more employees and £24bn larger revenue than Kraft Heinz.[12] Unilever declined the initial proposal.[13] The take over was subsequently abandoned on 19 February soon after UK Prime Minister Theresa May had ordered a scrutiny of the deal.[12]

Chicago is said to be one of those towns in America that prefers mustard over ketchup on hot dogs.
So of course that is where Chicago- and Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) has gone to see if it could trick Chicagoans into going for Heinz ketchup on a hot dog instead of the preferred mustard.

                            Chicagoans are being encouraged to try a new product from Kraft Heinz.                        










 


The company timed the introduction of its cagily branded "Chicago Dog Sauce" in the Windy City to coincide with today's designation as National Hot Dog Day.
Kraft Heinz has priced the gimmicky sauce at $5 a bottle, plus shipping and handling of orders placed at chicagodogsauce.com.




The fact that Kraft Heinz isn't taking up valuable grocery store shelf space in Chicago to entice locals to try Chicago Dog Sauce certainly suggests the company doesn't have great expectations for this gimmicky little ploy.
But it's a ploy that at least will remind Chicagoans focused on mustard that Heinz ketchup will always be there as an alternative if the day ever arrives when they have a yen for the red stuff instead of the yellow on their wieners. Not likely. But you never know.
In any event, Kraft Heinz says it will support the introduction of its Chicago Dog Sauce with print and out-of-home advertising and a lot of — you guessed it — public relations outreach.
The touching tagline for this little endeavor: "Heinz Loves You Chicago. And We Want You To Love Us."

Kraft Heinz aims to boost sales with new products, cross branding

 Growth is getting harder to come by for the biggest packaged food companies as consumers look for healthier options at the supermarket and avoid some of the heavily processed fare offered by major food manufacturers. 
 Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz Co. is battling the trend by introducing products that emphasize natural and organic ingredients, adjusting some items with an upscale look and expanding into new categories. 
 The new products have been anything but revolutionary, but small changes can make a big difference with consumers, experts say. 
  Kraft Heinz since February has rolled out an organic version of its Capri Sun fruit drinks and removed all artificial flavors, colors and preservatives from its mainstay Kraft Mac & Cheese dinners. 
 The company expanded its condiment offerings in April with the introduction of Heinz branded BBQ sauces, including Kansas City Sweet & Smoky and Carolina Tangy Vinegar. 
 To appeal to premium-brand shoppers, Kraft Heinz in April introduced Classico Riserva pasta sauces, with no artificial ingredients or added sugar, and macaroni and cheese meals flavored with varieties of Cracker Barrel cheddar cheese. 
 The world's fifth-largest food and beverage company has surprised some observers with early success lifting sales during a challenging time when many of its peers have struggled to find growth. 
 The company's executive team, led by CEO Bernardo Hees, was known for its expertise in cutting costs but not for organic growth. Expenses dropped 19 percent a year after they took iconic ketchup maker H.J. Heinz private in 2013. But sales declined 5 percent to $10.9 billion over the same period as the company eliminated unprofitable products. 
 Hees pursued revenue growth through a merger with Chicago-based Kraft Foods Group in 2015. Less than a year after completing the that merger, Hees and his team are being hailed both for product development and cutting costs. 
 Kraft Heinz posted a 0.2 percent increase in U.S. sales to $4.7 billion when it announced first-quarter results last month. The company beat analysts' prediction of a sales decline in the United States with gains from high-protein Lunchables meal packs and increases from its food service business, which started selling Oscar Mayer hot dogs to fast food chain Burger King in February. Kraft Heinz and Burger king are partly owned by 3G Capital . 
  “Our emphasis on profitable sales growth is paying off,” Hees told analysts during a conference call last month. “Our market share trends are improving behind innovation and marketing investments.” 
 Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said Kraft Heinz is doing a good job of expanding existing brands to more consumers in the United States. 
 “They've always said from the beginning that they plan to focus on big bet innovation to drive sales,” she said. “However, how this innovation has translated into results has been a pleasant surprise.” 
 Raphael Moreau, an analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International in London, called Kraft Heinz's performance “counter-intuitive” given the “stagnant growth” in many food categories in which the company sells products. 
 U.S. food sales performance has been mixed in the past 12 months, according to data from market research firm Nielsen. Unit sales of pasta sauces were down 0.6 percent in the 52 weeks ended April 30. Unit sales of nuts fell 0.4 percent over the same period. But refrigerated condiments and cheese posted gains of 5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. 
 While pasta sauces may be struggling, Classico Riserva hits on a trend of consumers wanting companies to remove preservatives and other artificial ingredients from their food. Riserva has no added sugar, which fits with another desire of American shoppers. 
 “Sugar is the No. 1 thing that consumers want out of their diet,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at NPD Group, a New York research company. 
 Kraft Heinz is taking advantage of the trend in cheese with its high-protein P3 Lunchables meal pack, a co-branded product that combines Kraft cheese, Oscar Mayer meats and Planters nuts. And its BBQ sauces fit with higher demand for condiments. 
 Moreau said he would like to see Kraft Heinz build on its success with P3 Lunchables and come out with more co-branded products and healthy snacks. 
 The food manufacturers experiencing the biggest growth have products that are protein-rich and perceived as more natural, according to an April report from IRI Worldwide, a Chicago-based market research company. 
 Also a headwind for Kraft Heinz is a move by some consumers to buy from smaller companies. More than $18 billion in industry sales have shifted away from the largest companies to smaller players since 2011, the IRI report found. 
 Younger consumers are “a little less trusting of those big corporations,” Seifer said. But companies can counteract the sentiment by touting efforts around environmental sustainability and humane treatment of animals, he said. 
 Kraft Heinz in March said it would only use eggs from cage-free hens in North American products by 2025, part of an initiative pushed by the Humane Society of the United States. 
 Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said the company is “committed to pushing the boundaries of innovation” through what it calls its “big bets” strategy that thoroughly tests new products with consumers before releasing them and then puts a larger advertising budget behind their launches. The company has said it will spend $50 million more this year on advertising. 
 The company's first big bets were Heinz mustard, which was launched in 2015 and featured in a series of ads, and all-natural Kraft Mac & Cheese, introduced this spring. 
 “At Kraft Heinz, our big bets will continue to ramp up as the year progresses, covering a full spectrum of innovation. We look forward to sharing more exciting news with our consumers in the months ahead,” Mullen said.

Kraft has been wrestling with low margins and flat sales amid the shifting tastes of consumers.

First it was Budweiser beer. Then came Burger King Whoppers. Next up was Heinz ketchup.Now 3G Capital, a Brazilian private investment group that already owns a suite of America’s most prominent food and beverage brands, has struck a deal to take control of Kraft Foods, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oscar Mayer meats, Planters nuts and Jell-O.Working with the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, 3G said on Wednesday that it would merge Kraft with Heinz, the condiment and canned foods giant it acquired with Mr. Buffett in 2013.Once combined, the Kraft Heinz Company will be one of the largest food and beverage conglomerates in the world, with nearly $28 billion in annual sales, and is expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion.The mega-deal — by far the largest merger of the year — is a big bet on conventional staples of the American cupboard, even as consumers are shifting away from processed foods. Millennials and affluent consumers are seeking more local, fresh and organic products. Lower-income consumers are spending less on name brands.

“This is a doubling-down on processed, packaged, sugary foods at a time when people are moving away from them,” said Marlene Morris Towns, a professor of marketing at Georgetown University. “We’re becoming much more conscious about what we eat.” Continue reading the main story

But by uniting Kraft with Heinz, 3G intends to follow a familiar playbook: Take ownership of iconic brands, aggressively cut costs and expand internationally. The model has succeeded at Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, which 3G created by taking over Anheuser-Busch in 2008.

Buffett on Kraft-Heinz Deal


Following the merger of Kraft Foods and H. J. Heinz, the billionaire Warren E. Buffett said that the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital would hold on to their investment.

The group then acquired Burger King in 2010 and last year merged it with the Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons to form a new company, Restaurant Brands International. And in 2013, 3G and Mr. Buffett teamed up to buy Heinz, taking the ketchup maker private. Since then, its sales have grown steadily.Now, by combining Kraft and Heinz, 3G and Mr. Buffett are betting that this recipe will work with some of the biggest names in packaged and processed foods, including Kool-Aid, Velveeta and Lunchables.“Combining our two businesses, we’ll create the third-largest food and beverage company in North America and the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world,” Alex Behring, the managing partner of 3G, who will be chairman of Kraft Heinz, said on a call with investors. “The company will enjoy significantly enhanced scale in its key North American market, not only at retail but also in the food service channel.”In particular, the new owners intend to use Heinz, which generates most of its sales abroad, to expand the global appetite for Kraft, which sells almost all of its products in the United States.“Heinz currently benefits from a truly global platform, which we will leverage to expand the reach of Kraft’s brands to consumers across the globe,” Mr. Behring said.Despite the deal’s size, former regulators did not expect significant antitrust hurdles.“These product lines seem to be more complementary, but where they find any overlaps they could look for a divestiture of the overlap lines,” said Richard Dagen, a partner at Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider and a former official at the Federal Trade Commission. “Heinz mustard on Oscar Mayer hot dogs would be a nice complementary product line.” 



                Brazilian Investor 3G Capital’s Big Food Deals            

                With deals involving Burger King, Kraft and the company behind Budweiser, 3G Capital and one of its backers, Jorge Paulo Lemann, have become powerhouses in the world of food brands.            











Plans to merge Kraft and Heinz have been in the works for years. When 3G and Mr. Buffett took over Heinz, they identified Kraft as an ideal merger partner. Early this year, soon after John T. Cahill took over as chief executive, 3G and Mr. Buffett approached Kraft about a deal.

And as he was with Heinz, Mr. Buffett was instrumental in bringing the deal together. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, is investing beside 3G again and will help pay a special dividend to Kraft shareholders.“I am delighted to play a part in bringing these two winning companies and their iconic brands together,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. “I’m excited by the opportunities for what this new combined organization will achieve.”

The merger is a return to mega-deals for Mr. Buffett, who has maintained that he is hunting for “elephants,” large companies he can incorporate into the growing Berkshire conglomerate. Just last month, in his annual letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett hinted that he would like to do a deal like this with 3G.As a combined company, Kraft Heinz will have revenue of about $28 billion, with eight individual brands each reporting sales of at least $1 billion a year, and five brands with $500 million to $1 billion in sales.Heinz will control 51 percent of the combined company, while Kraft shareholders, who have yet to vote on the deal, will own 49 percent.

MARCH 26, 2015

            By The New York Times        


Kraft shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $16.50 a share, or about $10 billion, to be paid for by 3G Capital and Berkshire. The dividend represents a 27 percent premium based on Kraft’s market value of about $36 billion on Tuesday. Shares of Kraft surged more than 35.6 percent on Wednesday, to $83.17.In addition to the dividend, Kraft will hold a nearly 50 percent stake in a company expected to have a market value of more than $80 billion. Because Heinz is private, its equity value is not publicly known, but people briefed on the matter said the combined company was expected to be worth as much as $100 billion by 2017.The stake owned by 3G and Berkshire will remain privately held while the rest of the company’s stock will be publicly traded on the Nasdaq. In time, some of the stock controlled by 3G and Berkshire could be sold to public shareholders, but the companies expect to retain effective control even if their equity ownership dips below 50 percent.

From its base in Brazil, 3G has become a powerhouse in the world of food brands. With the firm, which counts the billionaire financier Jorge Paulo Lemann among its owners, Kraft will get management known for its cost-cutting skills and strategic acumen. Mr. Behring, the managing partner of 3G, will be chairman of Kraft Heinz, while Bernardo Hees, the chief executive of Heinz, will be the chief executive of the combined company.The companies estimated they could find savings of $1.7 billion annually by the end of 2017 through cost reductions and efficiencies of scale. Much of that could come from cutting jobs, something 3G is known to do after acquiring companies.The combined company intends to pay a dividend, as Kraft does today, and increase it over time. Kraft Heinz will have co-headquarters in the Chicago and Pittsburgh areas.

And while the deal represents a big bet on processed foods that are losing ground to more healthful options, analysts say products from Kraft and Heinz will be strong sellers for years. Moreover, they suggested that Kraft Heinz could introduce more healthful versions of some of the strong brands in its portfolio.“Consumption patterns move like plate tectonics, and this move to fresh has been happening over decades,” said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group. “We do expect it to have legs. But it’s going to take a while.”
