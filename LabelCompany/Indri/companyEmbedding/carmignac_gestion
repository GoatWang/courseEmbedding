Why you may ask? Let me explain...Firstly, the leader of the team - How this guy ever got this role is beyond me. He has no clue about digital at all. His lack of experience was clear from the moment I first spoke with him. Digital strategy is completely alien to him, it’s pretty much learning on the job or taking advice from various agencies. How his superiors haven’t cottoned on to him is beyond me. Carmignac recently launched a new website which was meant to be an improvement to what currently existed, however this wasn’t the case. The website looks poor and performs just as badly.Secondly, his partner in crime, who is his right hand man and just below him - this guy is something else. He spends his days at the agency or surfing the web. His knowledge is very limited in all things digital, he likes to 'talk the talk' but can’t 'walk the walk'. Like the leader of the team he has never coded a webpage or ran successful digital campaigns. Don’t believe me, head over to LinkedIn and check out their endorsements...anything digital in there? Bit odd you may ask for such positions within a successful company such as Carmignac. The reason being is these two used to work together previously...now all of a sudden they are heading up the digital operations of this European asset manager. Some might say the old saying could come into play here, "it’s not what you know, it’s who you know".If you make it past the month within this department after having to suffer constant harassment, insane decisions, poor web practice and having no say or involvement in any web related decisions then you have done amazingly well, in fact you deserve an award.In regards to the rest of the company, I found other departments to be pretty good, there are some very clever and nice people within the organisation and it is run by a very astute man, Monsieur Carmignac. Unfortunately, the company is let down on a digital side by very poor management and a lack of knowledge from senior members of the digital team.Advice to ManagementTake a good hard look at the digital team, there are massive problems there, although im sure you already know this.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Carmignac Gestion Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Carmignac Gestion 2017-06-21 15:40 PDTReviews > Carmignac Gestion There are newer employer reviews for Carmignac GestionSee Most Recent There are newer employer reviews for Carmignac GestionSee Most RecentWork at Carmignac Gestion?
