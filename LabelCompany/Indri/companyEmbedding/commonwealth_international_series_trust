                                         COMMONWEALTH INTERNATIONAL SERIES TRUST
                                                   COMMONWEALTH NEW ZEALAND FUND

Dear Shareholder,                                                               

We are pleased to present this annual report on the Commonwealth New Zealand    
Fund for the period ended October 31, 2000. The Fund's net asset value ("NAV")  
on October 31, 2000 was US$7.19 per share compared to US$9.27 at the end of our 
October 31, 1999 fiscal year.                                                   

FUND'S COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE                                                  

The Fund's strategy continues to concentrate on a diversified portfolio of small
and medium-sized stocks not readily available to individual US investors. The   
most relevant index against which to compare the Fund's performance is the New  
Zealand Small Company Index ("NZSCI") that measures the performance of small to 
medium cap stocks of the New Zealand market. From October 31 1999 to October 31 
2000, the NZSCI decreased by (-4%) in local terms or by (-24.8%) in US dollar   
terms; while the Fund's total return was (-22.0%) in United States dollars.     

The fund therefore outperformed its benchmark over the period by +2.8%. In      
analyzing comparisons of performance to the NZSCI, the reader should remember an
index does not reflect currency conversions, cash positions, brokerage costs or 
administrative or management fees incurred by the fund or individual investor.  

NEW ZEALAND MARKET OVERVIEW                                                     

The economy is growing at a steady but weak pace. Exports are robust but imports
have outpaced them. Also rising oil prices are adding to inflationary pressures 
but domestic demand remains soft thereby helping keep the lid on inflation.     
Retail sales were robust with September sales increasing 1.4% (excluding autos) 
according to Deutsche Securities NZ.                                            

A weak NZ currency, the uncertainty of the impact on business of the new Labour 
Party led government, foreign investor selling and poor performance from its    
star company (Telecom NZ) helped the market lower over the period. Going        
forward, we believe the downside risk to be limited. The government             
superannuation fund (retirement fund) will soon be allowed to invest in the     
equity market. This means that close to NZ$500 million could be injected in the 
market over the year 2001. The merger talks between the New Zealand and the     
Australian stock markets, if effected, could increase investor confidence in the
New Zealand market while attracting more foreign investments. The signs of a    
currency recovery against the US dollar and the rally in the Telecom NZ shares  
in October (up 12.3%) are good indicators of a bottoming out. Ord Minett        
forecasts a market earnings per share growth rate of 15.6% and an average 5.7%  
dividend yield, which supports a positive total market return projection for the
2001 calendar year of 20% in local terms.

STRATEGY: Although some uncertainty still remains in the market, Ord Minett     
estimates the market to be 8% undervalued in its October 2000 Equity Research   
report. A rebound in the local currency will improve sentiment. With the        
economic growth slowing down, larger cap stocks are unlikely to outperform the  
small cap stocks. We would focus on stock selection with emphasis on companies  
with increasing market positions, reliable earnings and exposure to exports. We 
believe the weaker currency has boosted their price competitiveness.            

The Australian market has provided attractive returns over the long run due to  
the country's record of stable earnings growth and moderate inflation. The      
transition into a service-oriented economy is positive for the market. Its low  
correlation with the rest of the world makes it a safe hedge. The market        
correction in 2000, coupled with the weaker currency over the year present a    
good entry opportunity into this market.                                        

We are pleased to announce that Cheikh B. Mbaye has joined our management team

                                                   COMMONWEALTH NEW ZEALAND FUND

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF                                    
COMMONWEALTH INTERNATIONAL SERIES TRUST                                         

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments of Commonwealth (formerly Capstone) New Zealand    
Fund (a series of Commonwealth (formerly Capstone) International Series Trust), 
as of October 31, 2000, the related statement of operations for the year then   
ended, the statement of changes in net assets, for each of the two years in the 
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the four years in   
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are  
the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express  
an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our  
audits. The financial highlights for the year ended October 31, 1996 were       
audited by other auditors whose report dated November 18, 1996, expressed an    
unqualified opinion on the financial highlights.                                

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial       
highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of      
October 31, 2000, by correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes  
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by      
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Commonwealth New Zealand Fund as of October 31, 2000, the results of its        
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of   
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the four years in the period then ended in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - OCTOBER 31, 2000 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                        

    Capstone New Zealand Fund (the "Fund"), is one of two series of beneficial
interest of Commonwealth International Series Trust (the "Trust"), which changed
its name from Capstone International Series Trust effective October 10, 2000.   
The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
a diversified open-end management investment company. The Fund's investment     
objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation and current income by       
investing in equity securities, debt securities, and securities convertible into
common stock of New Zealand issuers. The following is a summary of significant  
accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its 
financial statements.                                                           

A) VALUATION OF SECURITIES - Portfolio securities which are traded on securities
exchanges are valued at the last sales price on that exchange prior to the      
relevant closing or, if there is no recent last sales price available, at the   
last current bid quotation. A security which is listed or traded on more than   
one exchange is valued at the quotation on the exchange determined to be the    
primary market for such security. Fixed income securities are valued using      
market quotations or pricing services. In the absence of any applicable price,  
securities will be valued at a fair value as determined in good faith in        
accordance with procedures established by the Board of Trustees.                

B) CURRENCY TRANSLATION - For purposes of determining the Fund's net asset      
value, all assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency values
are converted into U.S. dollar values at the prevailing market rate at 14:00 GMT
on each U.S. business day, as established by the Board of Trustees. The cost of 
securities is determined by using historical exchange rates. Income is          
translated at approximate rates prevailing when accrued. The Fund does not      
isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments which is due to changes 
in foreign exchange rates from that which is due to changes in the market prices
of the investments. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and    
unrealized gains and losses from investments.                                   

C) ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS - Security transactions are accounted for on the  
trade date. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are based on the 
identified cost basis for both financial statement and Federal income tax       
purposes. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the 
ex-dividend date. Discounts and premiums on bonds purchased are amortized over  
the life of the bonds. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.

D) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES - No provision has been made for Federal income taxes   
since it is the policy of the Fund to continue to comply with the special       
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment      
companies and to distribute all of its taxable income and realized capital      
gains, to relieve it from all, or substantially all, such taxes. At October 31,
2000, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward of $73,404 which expires in 2006.
Under the United States-New Zealand tax treaty, New Zealand imposes a           
withholding tax on dividends (15%) and interest (10%) received by the Fund.     
There is currently no New Zealand tax on capital gains.

                                                   COMMONWEALTH NEW ZEALAND FUND

E) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS - The Fund distributes its net investment      
income, if any, and net realized gains (net of any capital loss carryovers)     
annually. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance    
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting 
principles. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for     
foreign currency transactions and capital loss carryovers.                      

F) USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make       
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and        
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ    
from those estimates.                                                           

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES, ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND                      
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES                                              

The Fund retains FCA Corp, ("FCA") as its Investment Adviser. Under the 
Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement"), the Adviser is paid a monthly  
fee based on the average net assets at the annual rate of .75%.                 

Effective October 7, 2000, Declaration Service Company replaced Capstone
Asset Management Company as administrator to the Fund.                          

As of October 7, 2000 Declaration Service Company replaced PFPC Inc. as 
transfer agent.                                                                 

Declaration Distributors, Inc. replaced Capstone Asset Planning Company 
("CAPCO") as Distributor of the Fund's shares effective October 7, 2000.        

  The Fund has adopted a Service and Distribution Plan (the "Plan") pursuant
to Rule 12b-1 under the Act whereby Fund assets are used to reimburse CAPCO for 
costs and expenses incurred with the distribution and marketing of shares of the
Fund and servicing of Fund shareholders. Distribution and marketing expenses    
include, among other things, printing of prospectuses, advertising literature,  
and costs of personnel involved with the promotion and distribution of the      
Fund's shares. Under the Plan, the Fund pays CAPCO an amount computed at an     
annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average net assets (including          
reinvested dividends paid with respect to those assets). Of this amount, CAPCO  
may reallocate to securities dealers (which may include CAPCO itself) and other 
financial institutions and organizations (collectively, "Service Organizations")
amounts based on the Fund's average net assets owned by stockholders for whom   
the Service Organizations have a servicing relationship. The Plan permits CAPCO 
to carry forward for a maximum of twelve months distribution expenses covered by
the Plan for which CAPCO has not yet received reimbursement. For the year ended 
October 31, 2000, the Fund paid $9,574 in 12b-1 fees. Of this amount            
approximately 7.5% was paid to Service Organizations other than CAPCO. On       
November 13, 2000, the Board of Trustees voted to approve a new Rule 12b-1 Plan 
for the Fund with First Commonwealth Holding Corp., the parent company of FCA,  
replacing CAPCO under the Plan, pending approval at a special meeting of its    
shareholders on December 22, 2000.

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund who are also officers and     
directors of the Adviser, the Administrator, Distributor or CFS, received no    
compensation from the Fund. During the year ended October 31, 2000, trustees of 
the Fund who are not "interested persons" received trustees' fees of $1,454.

      * The New Zealand Small Companies Index is a capitalization-weighted index
(adjusted in US dollars)of all New Zealand equities including those on the New  
Zealand Stock Exchange 40 index and is not an investment product available for  
purchase.                                                                       

      ** The Australian All Ordinaries Index (AAOI) is a capitalization-weighted
index (adjusted in US dollars) comprised of the largest 500 Companies as        
measured by market capitalization that are listed on the Australian Stock       
Exchange.                                                                       

 *** The New Zealand Exchange Limited 50 Free Float Total Return Index
(adjusted in US dollars)is a modified market capitalization weighted index. The 
index consists of the top 50 companies by free-float adjusted market            
capitalization that are listed on the New Zealand Exchange Limited and is not an
investment product available for purchase. The New Zealand Stock Exchange       
launched the new headline index, NZSX 50, to bring its primary benchmark index  
in line with international best practice, and to better reflect the performance 
and returns to shareholders, derived from investment in securities on the New   
Zealand Stock Exchange. The existing sector indices calculated by the New       
Zealand Stock Exchange will be discontinued and new sector indices based on     
global criteria (such as the Global Industry Classification System) will be     
introduced to allow comparability to overseas exchange. Because of these        
improvements in performance measurements, the fund will begin using the New     
Zealand Stock Exchange Limited 50 Free Float Total Return Index.                

 After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest federal
marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local      
taxes.                                                                          

   Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may
differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to    
investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as  
401(K) plans or individual retirement accounts.                                 

    A Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an
indication of how that Fund will perform in the future.                         

PLEASE RETAIN THIS SUPPLEMENT AND KEEP IT WITH THE PROSPECTUS FOR FUTURE        
REFERENCE.

This Smith-Cooper International 160 series lug style butterfly valve is made of iron for compressive strength and resistance to wear. It has a lever handle, Buna-N seat, a stainless steel 316 disc, and flanged connections on both ends. This lug-style valve is secured between two pipe flanges by a separate set of threaded bolts for each flange and is suitable for end-of-line service and removal or replacement of downstream piping. The disc is made of stainless steel 316, which has higher strength and greater corrosion resistance than stainless steel 304. Buna-N seats are high tensile strength and resistant to oil, fuel, and other chemicals. The lever handle rotates the disc in the valve seat to fully open, regulate, or stop flow through the valve. This valve has a maximum pressure of 200 pounds per square inch (psi), and an upper temperature range of 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Flanged connections surround the valve body on both sides for bolting to pipes and for easier installation and maintenance than welded connections. Butterfly valves are used to regulate flow between pipes, tubes, and hoses by rotating a lens-shaped disc in the center of the valve and are suited for high-capacity, low-pressure applications. When the valve is fully opened, the disc face is parallel to the inlet and outlet of the valve, and when the valve is closed, the disc face is perpendicular to the opening of the valve. Butterfly valves may have a handle or lever that aligns with the disc position (open or closed) for manual flow control. They are primarily used in applications including agriculture, water treatment, fire protection, compressed air or gas, and vacuum service. Smith-Cooper manufactures a wide variety of pipe fittings and valves. The company is headquartered in Commerce, California, and meets relevant ANSI, ASTM, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9002 standards.
