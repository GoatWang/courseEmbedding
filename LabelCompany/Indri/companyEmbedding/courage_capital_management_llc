It is possible that performance goals of the fund may not be achieved and that an investor could lose all or a significant portion of its investment.

It is possible that performance goals of the fund may not be achieved and that an investor could lose all or a significant portion of its investment.

Credit Opportunities  /  Special Situations






Credit Opportunities

OverviewStrategyApproachInvestment CharacteristicsFund Info









Overview


The Credit Opportunities strategy focuses on long-term investing in the stressed and distressed debt of Lower Middle Market companies.Key components of the strategy include:
















Capitalizing on the inherent inefficiencies in the lower middle and distressed debt markets
Sourcing underfollowed opportunities within our circle of expertise




Leveraging our team's extensive experience and longstanding relationships
Investing in the debt securities at a significant discount




Providing capital and resources to improve the balance sheet

Creating value by providing operational expertise and resources














Strategy


The Credit Opportunities strategy seeks to generate long-term value and equity-like returns through opportunistic investments in the stressed and distressed debt securities of U.S. Lower Middle Market companies.


Courage seeks to construct a diversified portfolio of investments at discounted enterprise values (3.5x to 5.5x EBITDA) versus typical private equity sponsor transaction multiples (7x to 11x EBITDA).  Through its strategy of purchasing discounted debt in the secondary market, Courage seeks to generate equity-like returns with downside protection.Courage seeks to support senior management in developing and executing a business plan designed to maximize enterprise value. Courage may sit on company boards and deploy its operating partners when appropriate.








Approach
Downside Protection & Capital Preservation


The strategy employs a deep-value approach to investing with a long-term investment horizon and an emphasis on downside protection. Courage focuses on the less competitive, more inefficient Lower Middle Market segment.
The strategy provides current income and  downside protection consistent with credit investing yet offers significant upside potential typical of private equity strategies.The team’s substantial financial, restructuring, operational and industry expertise, coupled with its ability to source unique opportunities has enabled Courage to generate attractive investment returns through multiple market cycles.
