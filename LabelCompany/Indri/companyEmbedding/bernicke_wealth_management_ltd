Our Process

Individuals, business owners, businesses, and foundations interested in our services are required to attend a private group meeting or schedule an initial consultation before engaging our services.  To gain access to either of these venues, interested individuals should first call 715-832-1173.

The initial consultation is an exploratory meeting to collect goals, financial information, and to decide whether we mutually would like to pursue additional planning opportunities.  The wealth advisors and potential clients do not make any commitments without thoroughly discussing services, fees, and expectations at the initial consultation.  Assuming there is a meeting of the minds, additional meetings are scheduled as needed.

Additional plan design meetings are used to identify an individual's financial strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.  Stress testing financial assets against one's goals, providing specific recommendations, and implementation of one's uniquely developed investment plan also occurs at these meetings.  The number of additional meetings varies depending on the complexity of one's financial situation.

Once a client, ongoing communication continues.  Our firm monitors client accounts and contacts clients as needed when opportunities are identified where action is needed.  In addition, reviews are held with clients on a regular basis as scheduled and as one's financial situation changes.  Out of appreciation to our existing clients, we only accept a limited number of new clients each year.

Clients

  
      Our team has extensive experience in providing comprehensive financial solutions for individual investors, businesses, foundations and nonprofits. Our team currently services four distinct groups of investors.
  

Individual Investors

      Individual investors include executives, attorneys, engineers, doctors, and many other professionals who have retired or will be retiring within ten years.  Individual investors will typically seek our services when they want to ensure that their investment assets are organized in a manner consistent with their income, tax, estate, and other financial goals.
  

Businesses

      We help businesses in three distinct ways.
      
We provide retirement plan investment services.
We help key employees coordinate their employer sponsored benefits and personal assets with their holistic financial goals.
We help business owners create exit plans designed to transition their businesses to family members, key employees or third party buyers.

Foundation Investors

      Charitably inclined foundations use our firm’s research-driven investment strategies and prudent investment management to help ensure the organization’s mission is fulfilled.
      
      

 Nonprofits 
We provide transparent investment strategies in a consultative manner to help nonprofits achieve their unique goals.

Our Services


We act as a personal Chief Financial Officer for our clients. A personal Chief Financial Officer is similar to a general contractor for one's money.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

What Is Money Management?








 



Money management refers to how you handle all aspects of your finances, from making a budget for where each paycheck goes to setting long-term goals to picking investments that will help you to reach those goals. Money management is not just about saying "no" to any purchase, but developing a plan that allows you to say "yes" to the things that are most important to you. Any amount of money can prove to be too little if you don't have good money management skills.
Knowing Where You're At
The start of good money management requires you to know where you're at in terms of assets (things you own) and liabilities (amounts you owe). Your assets include your bank accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and property, like your house and car. Your liabilities include your credit card balances, student loans, car loans, mortgages and other debts. When you subtract your assets from your liabilities, you get your net worth. If your liabilities are more than your assets, your net worth is negative. But, with good money management, you can change that.
Setting Your Goals
Your goals dictate how you manage your money. It's easy to overlook your long-term goals in favor of just trying to figure out which bills get paid today. However, by setting goals, you can give clarity to which expenses are necessary and which ones you can cut out. There isn't a universal "right" and "wrong" when it comes to your spending goals, but it takes effort to attain them. If it's your dream to have a car that costs $25,000, you have to make more spending cuts than someone who only wants to spend $10,000 on a car.
Creating and Adjusting Your Budget
Creating a budget helps you stay on top of managing your money because you earmark certain amounts for certain expenses. For example, you might limit yourself to $200 for entertainment each month after accounting for other basic necessities and debt payments. However, your budget can be a moving target over time. If you realize you can buy groceries on sale and save $50 a month, you might increase your entertainment budget to $225 and add $25 to your savings budget. Alternatively, if you get a pay raise, budget that raise into your savings rather than adding it to discretionary spending amounts.
Managing Multiple Accounts
As you save for different goals, you will likely have money in multiple accounts. For example, you might keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account so you aren't tempted to tap it for an impulse purchase. Also, you can use an IRA or 401(k) plan to keep your retirement nest egg separate from your other money. You'll also use different strategies for goals with different time horizons. You might be able to be more aggressive investing in stocks and bonds with funds in your retirement account if you won't need the money for 30 years. On the other hand, you will want an account with out any risk, such as a savings account, for your emergency fund because you could need that money at any time. A software program, such as Quicken, can help you keep track of your various accounts to make sure you're staying on track with your spending and savings goals.

What Is Budgeting?








 



Budgeting refers to the process of determining how you are going to spend your money. Using software like Quicken can help you track your spending so you can make sure you're on target for your financial goals. And, if you fall behind, you can make changes to your budget and readjust your spending habits.
Budgeting Is a Guide
Your budget for any particular time period is a guide for how you want to spend your money so that you can achieve your financial goals -- both in the short-term and the long-term. When you set up a budget, you can see where your money could go, and then you get to decide in advance which options are most important for you. For example, if you don't have a budget, that snazzy new outfit or top-of-the-line grill might catch your attention in the store and get you to buy it even though you should be putting your money elsewhere. However, if you have a budget, and you know you want to prioritize saving for a new car or a house down payment, you can turn down impulse purchases because you know the money is already earmarked for something more important.
Gathering Necessary Information
To make a budget, you need to know your income and your expenses. Income includes not only your paycheck, but also any other money you receive, such as rent from a rental property or interest on a bank account. Your expenses include anything you spend money on, such as housing, food, clothing, insurance, entertainment and travel. To make an accurate budget, it helps to have several months worth of your past spending documented so you can make realistic predictions about how much you spend in each category. If you haven't tracked your spending in the past, just use your best estimate and adjust it as needed as you get more information.
Budgets Are for Everyone
Budgeting is something that everyone, regardless of income or net worth, can benefit from. No matter how much money you make, you can always go bankrupt if you spend more than you bring in. However, budgets are also very personal, in that you decide which goals are most important to you. For example, one person might put a high value on driving an expensive car and be willing to work an extra job or cut back on other expenses to have one, while another person might be content to drive a used car into the ground to save up for a special vacation.
Budgeting Is a Process
As much as some people might prefer to set their budget and forget about it, good financial planning requires you to reevaluate your spending over time and adjust your budget accordingly. For example, if you change jobs so that your commute is shorter each day, you may be able to reduce the amount you have budgeted for gas costs and increase your retirement savings. Or, if the cost of food goes up, you may have to cut back on the amount of times you eat out each month.

What is Retirement Planning?








 



Retirement planning is the process of setting goals for your retirement years and then creating a plan to fulfill those goals. Executing a retirement plan requires most people to put aside some of their current income for long-term savings and investment. You can use tax-sheltered vehicles, such as traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and employer pension plans, to fund part of your retirement plan with pre-tax dollars.
Living and Working Longer
Early in the process, you'll want to decide at what age you'd like to retire. It might be a rough estimate at this point, subject to change as the years roll by. Many people today are living and working longer than those in previous generations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2012 that the U.S. population's average life expectancy rose to a record high of 78.8 years. Gallup polls show that in 2014, the average American expects to retire at age 62, up from the 2002 figure of age 59. Actual retirement ages have also crept up during this period, from 63 to 66 years of age.
Setting Goals
You'll need to make an educated guess about the percentage of your pre-retirement annual income to save for your post-retirement years, a figure known as the "replacement rate." A 2013 research paper from Morningstar Investment Management indicated that the usual replacement rate of 70 to 80 percent may be too high by as much as 20 percent. Your individual replacement rate depends on several factors, including your earning power while working and your desired lifestyle after retirement.
Lifetime Planning
Armed with estimates of your retirement age and your replacement ratio, you can start formulating a long-term plan that shows how much you'll have to set aside each year to meet your retirement goals. Quicken's Lifetime Planner tool helps you determine the size of your retirement nest egg and the amount you can withdraw each year so that the money lasts through your expected lifetime. You can include other sources of retirement income, such as Social Security and company pensions. Quicken Lifetime Planner provides long-term planning facilities that can help you organize the information in an easy-to-understand format and track progress toward your goals.
Explore Your Options
You might want to explore different options when setting up your retirememt plan. You can work out variations of your plan in which you change your income estimates, the amount you save and invest each year, your expected rate of return on your investments, your retirement age or other factors. For example, you can experiment with the age at which you start receiving Social Security payments. You're eligible for these payments at age 62, but the longer you postpone these, the more you'll eventually get each month. You get the maximum payment if you wait until age 70 to begin drawing your Social Security payments. Another option is retiring in stages, gradually shifting from full-time employment to part-time work that you can do at home, such as writing or consulting. You might also need to adjust your assumptions about your post-retirement lifestyle.
