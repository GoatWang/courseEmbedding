120-Night Risk-Free Trial
Advanced, Elegance and Memory Foam Number Beds






Let’s be honest. Visiting a mattress retailer often means going back and forth between mattresses, and even then, you don’t really get to try out each mattress for more than a few minutes. That’s why Personal Comfort™ bed is setting a new standard for mattress buying by allowing our customers to try out our bed for a full 120 nights. Generally, your body takes roughly 3-4 weeks before it adjusts to your new sleeping surface. We believe that you need a full 120 nights to try out any new mattress. We’re so confident Personal Comfort™  Bed is the right choice for you that we’re willing to offer it truly risk free. If for whatever reason you’re not completely satisfied with your Personal Comfort™ bed, you may return your mattress purchase for a full refund on your mattress.
Selecting the right mattress can be a difficult process with several factors that determine your final decision. We invite you to do your homework and compare all number bed manufacturers. You’ll find that our largest competitor, Sleep Number® bed, only offers their customers a 100-night trial. We stand behind our products and believe in the Personal Comfort™ bed so much that we’re willing to let you try it out for 120 nights. When you’re ready to start your trial, our Sleep Specialists are here help you select the right mattress based on comfort, support, expectations, and your budget.


In some cases, budget can determine which mattress you start with, and there is a good chance you may not have selected the correct mattress from the start. That said, you may be eligible to participate in our Comfort Exchange Policy. What’s more, each of our mattresses can be upgraded or downgraded at anytime during your trial period. We stand behind our products and take pride in the fact that we strive to offer our customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee. When you make a decision to purchase a number bed from Personal Comfort™, we will do whatever it takes to continue to earn your business and your referrals.
All of us at Personal Comfort™ understand your need for a better night’s sleep, and that’s why we allow you to try our bed – in the comfort of your own home – for a period of 120 risk free nights. *Limit one trial per customer, per household. Select models not available in trial period. Please see terms of use page for the most accurate and up to date information on trial periods. Mattress must be returned in "like new" condition and pass inspection to be eligible for a full refund. 120-Night Risk-Free Trial excludes Classic Series.
For more information about products covered under our 120-Night Risk Free Trial, click here.






Your comfort is guaranteed!






100% satisfaction guaranteed with our comfort exchange policy

Personal Comfort™ Bed sets the industry standard by providing our customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee: a risk-free buying decision accompanied by a comfort exchange policy. The Personal Comfort™  bed is fully adjustable and has all available comfort settings in one single mattress.
However, if you’re not happy with you’re choice, it may be because of the different levels of comfort foam selected over the support of the air chamber core. Foam and fabrics are very expensive and can easily increase your budget, so it’s important to speak to a Sleep Specialist to help determine what upgrades get you closer to the level of comfort you desire.


If you need to take advantage of our comfort exchange policy, we will swap out your mattress with an equal value mattress, one time, and we will even pay for the shipping. Additionally, we will reset your trial period, if you qualify, so you can have enough time to try out the new levels of comfort in your mattress. If you’re still not satisfied, and you qualify for a return, we will refund you 100% of the original purchase price of the mattress. There is a limit of one comfort exchange for one mattress purchased by the same customer.
Our goal: for you to be happy with the way you sleep, thanks to your new number bed mattress.
Click here for more information about our comfort exchange policy.






120-Night Trial

Classic Series Only
Similar to the 120-night risk-free trial, the Personal Comfort®  Bed Classic Series products also qualify for a 120-night trial period, with a $149.00 restock fee. If the mattress you purchased qualifies for this trial, is returned before the expiration of the trial, and passes inspection as "like-new" condition, then a refund minus restocking fee for the mattress will be issued.

Enjoy Luxurious Comfort with Total Control

				The dual massage will soothe you as you rest, and help you ease tension in your body after a long day, while customizable positions ensure you get the rejuvenating environment you desire for any bedroom activity. Enhanced safety features make this luxurious adjustable base a great addition for your home.
			

				The S-Cape's Wallhugger technology makes any comfort adjustment a smooth transition. Simplistic in design without sacrificing in function, you can even put yourself in a position of virtual weightlessness, taking pressure off of your lower back and limbs. Any way you like it is yours as you escape the cares of your day.
			






				Fabulous features to enjoy maximum comfort in bed
			






Wireless, Stand-Up Remote Control
The technologically advanced wireless remote control stands on its own, so you can place it on your nightstand for easy access.




Upholstery

							Our S-Cape adjustable base is upholstered in a gorgeous  
							contemporary gray patterned fabric, making it a great 
							neutral to fit any decor.
						










Dual Massage With On-Off Button
The dual massage, built into the adjustable bed base, means that there are two separate areas at work to soothe you. One loosens up your shoulders and one helps to unburden those hard-working legs. With the touch of a button, you'll get an awesome sensation of all-over relaxation.




Wallhugger® Engineering

							Leggett & Platt's innovation team developed 
							state-of-the-art technology that puts you at the center of  
							the bed's motion. While other adjustable bed bases lift  
							your upper body away from the wall - and away from your  
							nightstand - bases with Wallhugger® engineering lift you  
							up while simultaneously gliding you back. That means your  
							favorite book and the remote control are within reach  
							whenever you're ready for them

It's a Dream!!
After over a year of debating and research, I purchased the Scape split King with a Latex Mattress (specifically for no off-gassing).  I had to communicate with Jo several times in customer service re: timing of delivery and she was fabulous! The bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin box-spring mattress. The mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls. The delivery came when I was working a 24 hour call shift (I'm Nurse-Midwife). My husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it. He wasn't happy about the $$$ I spent on it. (My money). Anyway, I digress.  He agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up. For that reason I ordered the "white glove service" where they set it up for you.  Through a mix-up with our local delivery service, they were unable to set up- just deliver.  I was sweating it because I didn't want to ask my husband for help.  So, at 0500 after a stressful day of work I came home to find the delivery. EEG!! So exciting!  My husband was asleep in the guest room and I set to work.  I open the two adjustable bases. The instructions were super clear and easy. I popped on the legs and wheels. I rolled the beds over and shoved them into place. I plugged them in to test them. Perfect. I rebuilt my bed frame around the Split King Scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the bases...all 137 lbs of me. No problem.  I did use a 3" foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress. I just cut it in half with scissors.  Put sheets on, showered and did what I couldn't wait to do...I fell into that bed and raised the feet up!!  My poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of God!! (In fact, we refer to our bed as the HOG (Hand of God) because if feels like the heavens opened up and God stretched out His hands to cradle you to sleep! My husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was (I was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor) and saw that I had assembled everything in about an hour.  He is now in love with the bed (of course). He has used a C-Pap since he was 25 years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea.  Before this bed, I woke up feeling like I had been beaten with a 2x4.  I thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years.  Now post-bed, I do NOT have those morning aches and pains. I LOVE THIS BED. I'm glad I bit the bullet and purchased one now. Highly recommend to anyone.  But, if you are a nurse, do yourself a favor and get an adjustable bed. 13 hour shifts are brutal. You deserve it!!!! 10 stars.

Life changer for my mother
My mother is older and spends more time in bed than ever before. She needed help propping up pillows under her head to watch tv and under her legs when she sleeps at night. It is very easy to use and now she can raise the head or foot of her bed with the touch of a button. She enjoys the massage feature as well. It's a life changer for her!�

The greatest bed ever.
I am a disabled Veteran with paraplegia and this bed is a life saver. I have endured five surgeries on my back and setting the bed the most comfortable after surgery is worth any price the bed may cost but fortunately the cost is very reasonable for what you get.  Complete adjustable ;for each partner in the bed. What more could you ask for? Why waste your money on another mattress when it will be worn out is six years and have to be replaced in about that time. I have mine for some 25 years & it still looks new plus it now has the new upgraded adjustable bed frame.

Wonderful Addition To Our Bedroom!
We have been sleeping on our new S-Cape Adjustable bed for a little over one month and we wonder how we ever slept without it? There are so many nice features on this bed which really turn sleeping into a luxury experience. I like to move the head of the bed upwards to sit up and watch tv and also to read before bed. I also like to turn on the massage and it puts me to sleep at night - I have it set on a timer so it turns off on its own. If I had a hard day at work, I like to raise the foot of the bed to improve the circulation in my legs - it feels great. It comes with 2 lighted remote controls which is nice - you can adjust your position in the dark. We are extremely pleased with our purchase. I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance your sleeping experience and quality of life. Plushbeds was wonderful from beginning to end - very knowledgeable staff, they helped us select the perfect bed.

We Absolutely Love It!
We are very happy that we took the leap and purchased this foundation from Plushbeds. We were nervous at first but called and the mattress specialist was very knowledgeable and nice. He took the time to answer all of our questions (and we had many). When the adjustable frame arrived, we were excited to set it up and test it out. It is heavenly! I like going to sleep with the massage on a timer so I don't have to worry about shutting it off. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up when I watch tv at night. We are having fun testing out all of the fun features on the remotes. We absolutely love it. My experience with Plushbeds and this Adjustable Foundation has been excellent from beginning to end.

Very nice bed
This is a very nice bed. It has turned my bedroom into a luxurious oasis! I look forward to going to bed every night. I like to run the massage for 20 minutes each night - it helps me fall asleep. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up each morning for my coffee and newspaper before I start my day. It's nice to not have to prop up pillow to do this anymore. I can just press a button and it is instant. I wish I bought this bed sooner.

SCape adjustable bed
We received our SCape in a very short time after ordering. Two men put it all together, including hauling it into the house from a truck, assembly of the two halves, putting on the mattress parts, mattress cover, sheets, etc. in two hours with absolutely NO problems.  Works great.  I think we will very much enjoy this adjustable bed.

								USDA / GOLS Certified Organic Latex
							

							As America's largest distributor of ARPICO organic latex, PlushBeds brings the world's finest latex directly from ARPICO's certified organic plantations to your bedroom. More expensive than natutal talalay latex or traditional dunlop, certified organic latex as per the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is latex that has been processed using only organically-grown, milky-white latex sap tapped from the rubber tree grown without chemicals, fertilizers, or pesticides, as well as being grown using one or more sustainable energy sources.
							Unlike talalay latex, which is infused with excess air to be light and   fluffy (ideal for pillows and top comfort layers), organic  latex   provides a heavier and more dense mattress core which is where the   support of your mattress comes from. The core is the largest, most   expensive component of a latex mattress and a high quality core can be   the difference between years of long lasting support or unpleasant   sagging indentations after a short period of time.                                                        

				While you'll sometimes find what appear to be great deals on 
				latex mattresses 
				claiming to be "organic", be sure that the true value bears that out, and that the retailer can produce the necessary documentation.

								100% Natural Talalay Latex Comfort Layer
							

								Right underneath your mattress's organic cotton cover is a plush comfort layer of the world's finest 100% natural talalay latex, which offers a pressure-reducing, buoyant sensation found only with 100% natural talalay latex. 
							

								Talalay latex is an effective barrier to dust mite allergen transfer and so it can help you sleep better! Dust mites are the #1 source of indoor allergens which may lead to sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion. This latex provides the highest quality, most consistent, breathable and resilient comforting latex available in the world.

								Non-Woven Organic Cotton Cover
							

								Breathe...deeply...it's, soft, high-quality 100% GOTS certified organic cotton. With unsurpassed non-restricted airflow, moisture absorption, breathability, and environmental safety, your Botanical Bliss latex mattress cover also provides more safety, environmental integrity and care because the cotton was grown without any dangerous pesticides or herbicides. Non-Woven mattress covers are softer, more breathable, more elastic, offer better moisture control, and provide better pressure relief than woven covers.

								100% Pure New Zealand Wool - No Chemical Flame Retardants
							

								Every Botanical Bliss is made in the USA with up to 10 pounds of Pure New Zealand wool - over three times what competitors use - allowing your body to get to a comfortable sleeping temperature quicker and maintain it through the night. Our Pure New Zealand Wool breathes more naturally than synthetic counterparts and creates a micro climate which assists in regulating body temperature and humidity, allowing your body to get to a comfortable sleeping temperature quicker and maintain it through the night.

								GreenGuard Gold Certified
							

Unlike most of our competitors, our entire mattress is GreenGuard Gold Certified as a low-emitting product. Through rigorous testing, UL Environment certifies our mattresses meet some of the world's most rigorous, third-party chemical emissions standards with strict low emission limits for over 360 volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Our Mattresses get reviewed quarterly to maintain this seal of approval. By being certified at the Gold level, our mattresses are beneficial for sensitive individuals such as children and the elderly.

MONEY BACK GUARANTEE



								Where a 100 Night Risk Free trial is truly Risk Free

If after the first 30 days you decide that your new mattress is not for you, simply call us to arrange a pickup. We'll send our carriers to your house to pick up your mattress.

The Botanical Bliss™ 100% All Natural Latex Mattress.



														When you upgrade to today's luxury mattress standards, you'll want a bed that's 100% natural, chemical free, 
														luxuriously comfortable, and long-lasting. Our slideshow will explain why we give you the quality, luxury, 
														and eco-friendly comfort that no other mattress company can.
													

  
You're about to see why after comparison shopping for a chemical free 100% natural mattress, more people choose 
														our Botanical Bliss™ 100% natural latex mattress over any other brand. PlushBeds gives you what no other mattress 
														can...an organically pure sleep surface and a clear conscience.













1. The Botanical Bliss™ latex mattress collection only contains 100% certified natural latex


While most "Latex Mattresses" sold today are promoted as "100% latex", but contain synthetic latex made from petrochemical products which have limited elasticity, Plushbeds is proud to offer 100% Natural Sri Lankan Botanical Latex with no synthetic blends or petroleum based products. With a more dense, supportive 100% natural dunlop core to prevent sagging and a less-dense top layer of 100% natural talalay latex for maximum pressure relief, you receive a mattress that offers optimized pressure relief and uncompromising support, resulting in deeper, restorative sleep.

  
	The Botanical Bliss™latex mattress offers the perfect combination of resilient support and pressure relief that can only be found with a solid 100% natural latex mattress.













2. PlushBeds offers the softest, finest quality Organic Cotton online.


Aside from the latex used in the mattress, the mattress cover is the next most important, yet most overlooked component to compare. Several online mattress retailers boast the use of organic cotton; however fail to mention its the cheaper, mass-produced woven organic cotton. Woven fabrics are tight, course and do not stretch, hindering the pressure-relieving benefits of natural latex.

  
	PlushBeds exclusive knitted mattress covers are softer, more breathable, more elastic, offer better moisture control, and provide better pressure relief than the mass produced woven covers used by our competitors.













3. Our Botanical Bliss™ uses a Pure New Zealand Wool fire barrier.



															Unlike competitors who use harsh fire retardants, our Botanical Bliss covers are created with soft Pure New Zealand Wool. 
															The Botanical Bliss mattress is ideal for those who suffer from feather, down, or synthetic bedding products 
															allergies. Our quilted mattress covers are naturally fire-resistant, ensure natural temperature regulation, are hypoallergenic, 
															antimicrobial, and are dust mite resistant.
														

  

																Our Botanical Bliss mattresses are protected by all-natural, Pure New Zealand Wool for its supportive qualities 
																to extra sensitive allergy requirements, as well as for its softness and comfort.
															














												4. No Smelly Glues...or adhesives of any kind. Our layers of natural latex are removable to adjust comfort.
											



														True 100% natural latex doesn't need to be glued; competitors who glue their layers may not be using 100% natural latex. 
														PlushBeds offers removable, adjustable layers so you can simply unzip your cover and rotate your layers of latex to adjust 
														the firmness of your mattress.
													

  
With un-glued latex layers, you can easily adjust your mattress firmness by changing a layer of latex without having to 
														return the whole mattress














												5. PlushBeds has a Rock Solid Reputation
											



														When you buy a natural latex mattress, you are making an investment in your sleep, your bodys revitalization, and your health. Like any investment, it's wise to look at the reputation of the company you are considering buying from. Are they an accredited business with the Better Business Bureau? How many complaints have been filed against them by other customers before you? This can be easily found by going to the Better Business Bureau and entering the name of the companies you've considered. A company's past track record is a good indication of what you might expect should problems arise after you've made your purchase.
													

  

															PlushBeds has a rock solid reputation and hundreds of readable reviews from verified customers.
														














												6. 4 different firmnesses available on every Botanical Bliss mattress.
											



														PlushBeds is not just a mattress retailer, but also the manufacturer. This gives us a broad range of options in the comfort levels we can offer. Where most internet retailers are limited to a single firmness per mattress model, PlushBeds offers 4 different firmnesses for each latex mattress we sell. Additionally, because each mattress is custom made, we can accommodate virtually any request. Need a specific height or specific firmness (ILD) that you don't see online? Just give is a call, and we'll be glad to assist in building a custom-made latex mattress that is just right for you.
													

  

															All Botanical Blis™ latex mattresses are available in 4 different firmnesses and are custom made, offering you more options to choosing the perfect mattress.
														














												7. 100 Night Comfort Exchange Program
											



														Wherever you decide to buy your latex mattress from, we hope you choose the correct firmness the first time around, but what if it's too soft or too firm? Most online companies glue their layers together, in fact, as many as 4 cups of glue are used in a single "all natural" latex mattress. If the firmness is not what you had hoped, what are your options? Your only option is to re-package the mattress and ship it back. The PlushBeds comfort exchange program offers an affordable and convenient solution to adjusting your mattress firmness without the hassle of having to return the whole mattress.
													

 

													Free of any shipping fees, we'll send you a new layer of natural latex in a different firmness, which 9 times out of 10 will solve a comfort issue without having to return your mattress.
														














												8. Easy, 100 Night FREE Mattress Returns
											



														If after 30 days you decide that your Plushbeds latex mattress is not for you, just call us within your first 100 nights and we'll pick up the mattress and bonus items for a full refund of your purchase price. Many competitors tell you they will "take the mattress back" but you will be required to pay return shipping costs ($300 - $500), restocking fees, or "damage fees", to be determined by the company after they receive your mattress back
													

 

														Every Botanical Bliss™ latex mattress comes with our famous 100 night Free return policy. We'll pay the return shipping costs for a curbside pickup, and you'll receive a full refund of your purchase price.
														














												9. Industry's Strongest 25 Year Warranty
											



														Plushbeds guarantees that your latex mattress will be replaced or repaired at our option, should it be deemed defective because of faulty workmanship or structural defects for a period of 25 years beginning on the date of delivery, with 100% coverage for 10 full years, and pro-rated in years 11-25. The latex mattresses we deliver to our customers are the same latex mattresses we sleep on ourselves, which is why we are proud to offer the strongest 25 year manufacturer's warranty in the industry.
													

  

																
													All Botanical Bliss™ latex mattresses are protected for 25 years from faulty workmanship or structural defects.
														














												10. It's the Latex Mattress Recommended by Professionals
											



														Our 100% natural latex mattresses are often recommended by orthopedic specialists and chiropractors. 
													The mix of pressure -relieving softness and buoyant support offered by our hypo-allergenic natural construction makes botanical latex an ideal bedding material. Don't settle for a synthetic or hybrid option when choosing all-natural botanical latex can prove to be one of the best investments for your health and longevity. 
													

														A latex mattress isn't a cure-all, and a website recommendation should never replace a visit to your doctor.
													

 

															Our 100% natural latex mattresses are often recommended by orthopedic specialists and chiropractors because of the unequaled support they provide.

The perfect mattress
I am 140 and a side sleeper. I ordered the 9" Botanical Bliss in soft but after a month, I decided it was too soft for me. I did the comfort exchange to the medium and it has made a nice difference. I am 100% satisfied. Great mattress. Gives great pain relief on your body. Feels good.

Still Happy
We were skeptical about ordering online, a mattress we had never tried, and the generally positive reviews for Plushbeds made me wonder if the reviews were screened, but I figured in the end, the return policy was solid, and you never really know a mattress until you sleep on it for a few days... but that was a year ago, and we still exclaim our love for this bed multiple times per week, if not every night.

Love our mattress!!!
We were incredibly hesitant to purchase a mattress online, but all of the positive reviews convinced my husband and I to take a leap of faith and we are so glad we did! We got the 9" Botanical Bliss in Medium/Firm with the orthopedic foundation. We are side and back sleepers and the support has been great for both of us. We've been sleeping on our new mattress for 4 months now and we're amazed at how much more comfortable it has been in comparison to our old innerspring pillowtop mattress. No more restless, sleepless nights, no more pain and discomfort in the morning, and no more allergies!! Side note, the unboxing process is pretty amusing--- so crazy that they can squeeze a queen sized mattress into such a tiny box! Just a heads up, the mattress is a bit heavy and floppy, so it's not easy to move around once it's rolled out. The foundation is sturdy and we were able to assemble it quickly and easily. The included supportive latex pillows and super soft Egyptian cotton sheets were an awesome added bonus! Our bed is sooooo comfy now and we would highly recommend giving a PlushBeds mattress a try. 5 stars all around for ultimate comfort, quality products, great value, fast shipping, and excellent customer service!

A+ customer service, great company
I was in a car accident and require a very hard mattress. I ordered the extra-firm mattress but after trying it out for a couple months, I decided that the mattress just wasn't offering the support that I needed. Customer service was wonderful. I returned the mattress for a full refund. It was easy and quick.

After one year, still recommend to anyone
After 30 yrs of marriage, we had been through too many spring coil beds every few years and tired of throwing away money and one of us uncomfortable always.  We knew he liked firm and I liked softer, so we got two Plushbed twin xls to make a king size together.  softer for me and firmer for him, and no need for rising and lowering function, just simple foundation box.  My husband was mortified that it came out of a box through the mail without trying it in a store as I ordered it based upon the reviews.  He now admits it was the best bed we have ever had.  No more hip pain for me as a side sleeper.

Good Mattress, Great Customer Service
I hadn't ever heard of a latex mattress before.  I finally found out what I was missing out on when my hubby decided we should get one after visiting a home show.  We don't buy stuff on the spot, so we went home and learned more about latex mattresses.  He selected one off of the Plushbeds.com website, it's the 9 botanical bliss. My husband likes a firm mattress. We called and asked for the extra firm. When we received it, it was a little too firm. We did the free comfort exchange and got the medium firm. It is great. We are very happy customers. Highly recommended. Great customer service.

Couldn't live without my Botanical Bliss!
I'm not really a materialistic person, and I try not to focus my attention on things, but instead on people and my relationships.  However, if there is one thing that I couldn't do without, it's my botanical bliss latex mattress from Plush Beds! I've never had this much luxury and comfort in my life.

No More Sheep to Count
We've had this mattress for less than a month, and we're already planning to replace the one in our daughter's room with another latex mattress from Plushbeds. It's really nice to know you can rely on being able to sleep like a baby every night. Who knew that all we needed was a great mattress? The company was very easy to deal with too, and they have a great guarantee.

Soft support - AWESOME Egyption cotton sheets... zzzzzzzz
It took me a week or so to adjust to a bed that actually supported correctly and was comfortable.  After that adjustment period I slept so well.. and normally, I sleep well, but this is better.The ONE CON: this thing is a BEAST to move around! Tell the wife she doesn't get to change her mind 5 times on where the bed goes and which direction... almost impossible to move by yourself! ...but other than that it's great!  NO smell. NO break in period. (Also the sheets that came with it for the add in deal... are wicked soft! Well done!)

Excellent Company
I've been sleeping on the Botanical Bliss mattress for exactly a month.  I love it.   I never thought I'd make such an important purchase online.  I couldn't find a pure latex mattress locally.  When I read their return policy which meant I wouldn't lose any money if I didn't like it, I decided to try it.  I have asked so many friends to come and try it out that I'm sure they think I'm a nut case.   After ten days, I decided it was too hard for me...I had chosen the medium firm.  I called Plush Beds and they immediately sent me a softer replacement for the 2" topper and it is perfect now. It's a wonderful bed.  Don't be afraid to try it.  You have nothing to lose because they'll take it back if you don't like it---but you will like it.

The Best!
I purchased the 9" Organic Botanical Bliss and, yestalk about bliss, I've never slept better.  Thisbed is super comfortable and from someone who has chronic lower back pain, this is remarkable. I have the orthopedicfoundation and Prestige bed frame.  I've just ordered a 3"organic latex topper because I want the bed a little higher (12" is a better size to get).  I also ordered the 3" extender kit for the bed frame glides.  Note that this latex has absolutely no smell out of the package, a big plus for me. The customer service and product expertise is is excellent.  I researched latex beds for over a year and I finally chose Plushbeds, and I am super glad I did for their great service and product.  I know you can't find a better Organic, Latex bed at an affordable price than at Plushbeds.  I got the Cyber Monday deal!  Their 25 year bed warranty and 100 day comfort exchange is hard to beat.

very expensive mistake
Admittedly comfort if very subjective....but this was a very disappointing purchase. I bought bed approx 2 years ago- usually wake up in more back and hip pain than I went to bed with. The problem is that the mattress is rigid- not firm with support nor comfy with give.....somehow it manages to not be supportive yet also doesnt flex to body contours. I spent a lot of time researching because I wanted the least toxic, most environmentally friend mattress I could afford. I think the materials do meet that criteria. I did try the comfort exchange, but by the time the new layer came, I tried it, decided I didnt like it, it was too late to return. I was prompted to write this review as plush beds came up when I was internet searching for a mattress topper- to try to make bed tolerable. oh well.

I can attest to the fine quality. bona fide, the real McCoy
They're the real deal. The way Plushbeds makes their mattresses is really neat.  When I got my mattress, the 9-inch bliss latex mattress, I unzipped it to inspect to make sure I wasn't getting a just a top layer of latex with some fillers or generic foam as a core.  Sure enough, it was in layers, and not glued together like some other mattress companies do it.  I can attest to the fine quality and comfort of this mattress. It's perfect.

A Great Mattress at a Great Price
I just want to say a few words of praise for Plushbed's Botanical Bliss Latex Mattress. For the longest time my wife and I both complained about the mattress we were using, without doing anything about it. Sometimes we would get up mornings grumbling about soreness in our backs, shoulders, or sides. A little over a year ago, we finally took action. I talked to one of our neighbors, a chiropractor, and he told us that 100% natural latex is the best. We researched and asked around and found Plushbeds to be the best. We are very pleased with our decision.

Happy
I am 67 years old, short, and have lower back pain due to moderate arthritis. My partner is 57 years old, and doing fine. We did a bunch of research. I hated the sinking into cement feeling of the Tempurpedic, along with the smell. So, we did it. We bought a beautiful platform bed and the 9" Botanical Bliss and LOVE IT. I find myself not wanting to get out of the bed in the morning! Plushbeds says try for 30 days before you decide if you like it. We liked it night one. If this holds up and does not develop a dip, like our Natura mattress did, it will definitely be our best bed and best sleep of all time.

Life-changing
I've struggled with lower back problems for years.  Upon meeting the President of PlushBeds at a conference, he recommended that I needed to try changing to his natural latex beds.  I took his advice, and am incredibly happy that I did.The 9" is plenty supportive (I'm about 200 lbs.).  Instead of sinking into the mattress like you would a memory foam, the mattress is resilient, supporting my body no matter if I am sleeping on my back or side.  It feels like a combination of a memory foam and an inflatable bed...in a good way.  My back pain has been diminished, and I have been waking up unafraid to roll over and get out of bed.  Awesome product and awesome company.

I cannot recommend this company highly enough!
I cannot recommend this company highly enough, both for their products and their service!  There was actually a mistake with my order and this company--especially the wonderful salesperson Judy-- bent over backwards to do everything possible to make sure I was well taken care of.  I was frankly amazed at how great they were.  They truly stand behind their word and their product.

Best rest ever
We ordered the 9" Botanical Bliss split king mattress, medium (24-26 ILD)  with adjustable bed frames for the foundation.  I found the construction quality to be amazing, but the mattresses were far too soft for our comfort. Thanks to Jo, our new best friend at Plush Beds customer service, we were able to exchange the top latex layer for a more firm layer, which provided the firm support and deep sleep experience we were hoping for. My spine stays perfectly aligned when I sleep on my side now. It has a healing effect that completely eliminates the muscle spasms that have been plaguing me when sleeping on other mattresses. My husband loves it as well. I would highly recommend this latex sleep system and the outstanding customer service.

6 months later still very happy
Body types matter to people who wonder if they should take the plunge, so I am female, 140 lb, 60's. I decided to order on line because the guarantee is much better than from a brick-and-mortar store where your money is trapped in that store.  I also could not find all-botanical latex locally. The sales staff asked detailed questions about my sleeping pattern and weight and gave great advice on selecting the perfect mattress for me.

Everything I was looking for!
I searched for MONTHS....researching mattresses! My old mattress was made in the traditional poly foam....TERRIBLE!  I slept so terribly hot and was awake all nite long...trying to cool off.  In my research I learned that latex does not hold heat....and it proved itself 100%!  I am about 2 weeks into this new mattress....and I haven't slept so well in years!  I am extremely happy!!!  I ordered medium firm....and it is not at all too stiff. It supports as well as gives.  LOVE IT!  Yes I would definitely recommend this mattress and have!  My only dislike...was in the pillows that did come with the bed. They were shreaded latex and I am a solid latex pillow sleeper...but I did want to try them to compare.  I think they would be fine for many, but because I have ALWAYS been a solid latex pillow person....it just didn't compare for me.  Great experience in all!

This Bed is Amazing!!
I am a side sleeper and ordered the medium firm. It was too firm for me. I did the comfort exchange and swapped it for the medium which is perfect for me. It gives my hips and shoulder more comfort when sleeping on my side.

First class company, product, pricing and customer service all in one place
We couldn't be happier. Our 9-inch Botanical Bliss latex mattress is the finest we've ever owned,.. very plush but totally supportive... Ahh, the comfort... perfect! Your prices were unbeatable anywhere on-line or at local bedding stores (and believe me we shopped hard). Also, your detail-rich website and company guarantees were critical in our decision-making. But most of all, your excellent customer service was the icing on the cake.

If there is an award for the best mattress, this mattress would win, hands down! It gives great pressure relief - no more back pain. It gives nice cushioned support and great comfort on your body. Highly recommended.

Very comfortable and soothing to the body
We've had our Plushbeds mattress for about 3 months, and we love it. It is very comfortable and It has eased my husband's lower back pain. It relives all pressure points and gives a nice support on your lower back - very soothing to the body. I fall asleep instantly and sleep throughout the night - (no more tossing and turning like I did on our old coil mattress). We spoke with Samantha on chat when deciding which mattress to order. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. Great customer service. Wonderful company and mattress. We are very happy.

The 9" medium firm botanical bliss mattress was the product I ordered. Everything arrived as advertised, and overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase. The "medium firm" mattress is definitely a bit firmer than one would expect. It's really more like a  firm mattress by department store standards, but the comfort exchange to the natural soft 2" topper gave the mattress just the touch of extra softness I wanted. Customer service was excellent, and I had my comfort exchange processed very quickly.

We did a lot of research before buying, and like everyone else, we were nervous about ordering online.  We've had our Botanical Bliss mattress for a year and a half now, and we've been very happy with it.  I highly recommend it!

Reduced Back Pain
It seems like so many people have back pain. I still do to too, but this latex mattress solved a lot of my pain problem, since I hardly have lower back pain anymore. It's heavier than I thought it would be, but probably weighs less than my other mattress did after it was filled with dead skin, LOL! Customer service was excellent, I've already referred my sister to your company.

Amazing mattress!! Last one I will own!
Fantastic Bed. Natural 100% Certified natural latex with no nasty chemical smell. Smells fresh and natural when opened up. Very easy setup, just unroll, add your topper, get those organic sheets on and enjoy the comfort with the added latex shredded pillows for perfect support of the neck and spine. My synthetic foam mattress went straight to the curb after sitting in the living room for just a day. That's how long it took me to realize this was the best purchase I made for my health. One third of your life is spent on a mattress sleeping, why wouldn't you want to sleep healthily without breathing toxic voc's with synthetic made chemicals. The liquid proof mattress cover is a nice bonus incase my puppy has an accident. No stains or smell are headed to the organic cotton zipper cover. Very pleased overall with the purchase and happy to take 5 minutes to add my review and hopefully have an impact on someone or a whole bunch of people's health. Shipping was super fast too. I couldn't have been happier!

Soft, comfortable &  supportive!
Growing up I slept on latex mattresses, forgot how comfortable they were, but as a child you wouldn't notice, right.  Now that I'm 65+ and a bed can make all the difference on how you feel when you sleep & when you get up,  my new 9" Botanical Bliss gives me a good nights sleep without waking up because I am feeling those pressure points hurting.  I feel well rested when I get up in the morning and am ready to start my day.  A little expensive, but the bed will last the rest of my life, my parents slept on their latex mattress for 50 years.

Sleeping like a baby
We thought about exchanging our med-firm bed a few times. I thought it was too hard the first 2 days. Our doctor recommended that we try a little longer and said that a little discomfort was normal. After the first week, sleeping on my back felt great! Can't wait to go to wake up and realize that I really slept ALL NIGHT without pain. LOVE this bed.

Fantastic
I ordered a medium firm 9" Botanical Bliss mattress and decided it was too firm.  I spoke with Jolene in customer service and decided to try the free comfort exchange to a regular medium. The medium is perfect and the comfort exchange was quick and easy to do! I have had the most wonderful sleep on this mattress. No back pain whatsoever. Jolene was wonderful and so is my new mattress. Couldn't be happier!

Botanical Bliss
All personnel I talked to were professional, helpful and courteous. I originally ordered a too firm a mattress and exchange was seamless and prompt. Both my wife and I are happy with mattresses and adjustable bases. We have since ordered a Bontanical Bliss for my Mother in law and she love it as well.

Thrilled with my purchase
My family and I live an organic lifestyle. It was important for me to have an organic mattress since we spend approximately 25 years of our life sleeping. Most non-organic mattresses contain chemicals and there are long-term health effects that may occur after prolonged exposure to these chemicals including cancers, damage to the heart, liver, central nervous system and kidneys. This is not something that I want my family breathing in every night. I did a lot of research and checked out all certifications. I found Plushbeds to be the best. 100% natural latex and organic with all certifications, including Greenguard Gold (not many mattresses have this, it was great to see). I ordered three of the 9" Botanical Bliss mattresses for all 3 bedrooms in our home. We received them 9 days after we placed the order and they were everything that we had hoped they would be. When we unwrapped the boxes, there were no odors at all. The mattresses were easy to set up and after 3 months of sleeping on them, we are thrilled! Very comfortable, feels great on my lower back and body. I sleep so well on this mattress. It feels great to go to sleep each night knowing that my family and I are not breathing in dangerous chemicals or fumes. We are very happy with Plushbeds and this mattress!

Good investment, we think at 1 week
We got 2 Twin XLs to place on the Prodigy 2.0 split King adjustable bed. Excellent night sleep even on first night, though hard to sort out what part is due to the mattress and what part to the adjustable bed base. At least in theory, a purely organic bed and bed covers/sheets, etc without chemicals is attractive. Hardest part of the mattress purchase is guessing at firmness that will be best. We got 1 med & 1 med-firm - will take more time to decide if one of them should be change to the other. But after less than a week conclusion is it was a good purchase that is good for our health, our backs, and our comfort. Both the mattress & bases have long warranties so hopefully the $5-6K cost is divided over much more than a decade. At this point, we think it was a good choice.

Great Mattress
Have been sleeping on our new Botanical Bliss for 3 weeks now and I am here to sing your praises! Had chronic hip and shoulder pain for several years and this mattress has made such a nice difference. I am a side sleeper and feel no pain when sleeping on my side in this mattress. Great pressure relief and cushioning!

Best Sleep In Years
Here is the amazing thing about this mattress: it almost feels like you're floating & there is nothing beneath you and yet you feel completely supported. I guess it's because you can't feel any pressure points no matter what position you sleep in. The Plushbeds customer service department answered all my questions, and the purchase and delivery went very smoothly, too.

So happy I decided to go for it!
I've been struggling with lower back muscle issues and have gone through two other mattresses in the past 4 years.  This bed surpassed my expectations.  I was nervous when it appeared rolled up in a box, but when the plastic wrap came off and it "settled", I inserted my med firm middle and had one of the best sleeps in a long time!  Very impressed with service, delivery and quality.

Good customer service
Overall the bed is very supportive, it's just not what my husband and I was looking for. I also feel that 9" is too thin for a mattress. However, the customer service at plushbeds was exceptional! I got fast responses and easy return process. Good place to purchase a mattress if you are really fond of latex!

best yet!
My husband and I saw this mattress, the botanical bliss, which was advertised online by plushbeds. after having bad results from other mattress companies in the past ( theirs either sunk in the middle after a few months, became  lumpy or way too soft after a few months,)  we tried plushbeds botanical bliss in the xtra firm WE LOVE IT!    it has stayed firm and we get a good  sleep each nite. Only wish we had found this sooner. They were polite and helpful in regards to putting it together, which was no problem at all, We would highly recommend them.   Mr & Mrs Kuty

We are ecstatic
I cannot describe the soothing and healing feel you get when you sleep on this mattress. I sit at a desk all day and my lower back is always achy. I'm a back sleeper and chose the medium firm. It gives great support but it also feels cushioned. It takes all of the pressure off my back. Amazing feeling. Great mattress.

9Inch Botanical Bliss
This mattress is a dream come true. 29-31 is firm enough for me.  I am 160 pounds, try to loose some, but this firmness is for  250pounds.  It is great support for my back.  I used to cry and scream during many nights because of spasm in my both legs.  Since I sleep on the 9" Botanical Bliss I have not have to cry or scream since.  If you are looking for new mattress go with Botanical Bliss, because their price is better.  The one 1" of wool on top of mattress and gooses down comforter will make your body feel nice and warm.  Looking for combination 29-31 with a 2" medium on top will take you to heaven whole night long.  Good luck and share your experience if you try my combination. I would love to hear it.

Very Pleased 
I too like so many on here, was skeptical about ordering a bed online.  One thing I did was throw out my old steel bed frame and had to retrieve it back as stupidly I thought the foundation came with a frame or something, but it is the slates that the mattress actually sits on.  Anyway after unrolling the huge heavy mattress my firest thought was why does it look so slim?  Well that is because I ordered the 9" mattress and just assumed it would look like the picture of the one on here (looks like a very big thick matress but it is not).Now that I've had a few days to sleep on the Medium firm one I ordered, I do love it.  It does cradle to my body's pressure points and is a wonderful and healthy sleep.So happy I purchased it now.  Another extremely satisfied customer.. OH you will want to purchase a mattress protector, I thought it came protected or something as I asked the sales lady she said yes.. so you have to go purchase one somewhere separately.On the free pillows sent, you can fold them in half, so I don't know how they will support your neck or head, but haven't tried them yet.

Enjoy Luxurious Comfort with Total Control

				The dual massage will soothe you as you rest, and help you ease tension in your body after a long day, while customizable positions ensure you get the rejuvenating environment you desire for any bedroom activity. Enhanced safety features make this luxurious adjustable base a great addition for your home.
			

				The S-Cape's Wallhugger technology makes any comfort adjustment a smooth transition. Simplistic in design without sacrificing in function, you can even put yourself in a position of virtual weightlessness, taking pressure off of your lower back and limbs. Any way you like it is yours as you escape the cares of your day.
			






				Fabulous features to enjoy maximum comfort in bed
			






Wireless, Stand-Up Remote Control
The technologically advanced wireless remote control stands on its own, so you can place it on your nightstand for easy access.




Upholstery

							Our S-Cape adjustable base is upholstered in a gorgeous  
							contemporary gray patterned fabric, making it a great 
							neutral to fit any decor.
						










Dual Massage With On-Off Button
The dual massage, built into the adjustable bed base, means that there are two separate areas at work to soothe you. One loosens up your shoulders and one helps to unburden those hard-working legs. With the touch of a button, you'll get an awesome sensation of all-over relaxation.




Wallhugger® Engineering

							Leggett & Platt's innovation team developed 
							state-of-the-art technology that puts you at the center of  
							the bed's motion. While other adjustable bed bases lift  
							your upper body away from the wall - and away from your  
							nightstand - bases with Wallhugger® engineering lift you  
							up while simultaneously gliding you back. That means your  
							favorite book and the remote control are within reach  
							whenever you're ready for them

            Also, does the Legget and Platt S-Cape only come in a King Split, or can you get a regular King that's all one piece?

what the difference between split queen and regular queen ?

                            on May 26, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: A queen sized bed is one 60" x 80" bed. The adjustable bed will work as one unit where the entire head and/or foot of bed moves up and down as one unit.A split queen sized bed is (2) separate 30" x 80" beds, side by side. The split queen adjustable bed is also 2 separate beds, side by side. Each side of the adjustable bed has its own remote control and each side moves independently. Both sides can be synced together to use as one unit as well. You should order the same size mattress as the adjustable frame.

It's a Dream!!
After over a year of debating and research, I purchased the Scape split King with a Latex Mattress (specifically for no off-gassing).  I had to communicate with Jo several times in customer service re: timing of delivery and she was fabulous! The bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin box-spring mattress. The mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls. The delivery came when I was working a 24 hour call shift (I'm Nurse-Midwife). My husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it. He wasn't happy about the $$$ I spent on it. (My money). Anyway, I digress.  He agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up. For that reason I ordered the "white glove service" where they set it up for you.  Through a mix-up with our local delivery service, they were unable to set up- just deliver.  I was sweating it because I didn't want to ask my husband for help.  So, at 0500 after a stressful day of work I came home to find the delivery. EEG!! So exciting!  My husband was asleep in the guest room and I set to work.  I open the two adjustable bases. The instructions were super clear and easy. I popped on the legs and wheels. I rolled the beds over and shoved them into place. I plugged them in to test them. Perfect. I rebuilt my bed frame around the Split King Scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the bases...all 137 lbs of me. No problem.  I did use a 3" foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress. I just cut it in half with scissors.  Put sheets on, showered and did what I couldn't wait to do...I fell into that bed and raised the feet up!!  My poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of God!! (In fact, we refer to our bed as the HOG (Hand of God) because if feels like the heavens opened up and God stretched out His hands to cradle you to sleep! My husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was (I was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor) and saw that I had assembled everything in about an hour.  He is now in love with the bed (of course). He has used a C-Pap since he was 25 years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea.  Before this bed, I woke up feeling like I had been beaten with a 2x4.  I thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years.  Now post-bed, I do NOT have those morning aches and pains. I LOVE THIS BED. I'm glad I bit the bullet and purchased one now. Highly recommend to anyone.  But, if you are a nurse, do yourself a favor and get an adjustable bed. 13 hour shifts are brutal. You deserve it!!!! 10 stars.

Life changer for my mother
My mother is older and spends more time in bed than ever before. She needed help propping up pillows under her head to watch tv and under her legs when she sleeps at night. It is very easy to use and now she can raise the head or foot of her bed with the touch of a button. She enjoys the massage feature as well. It's a life changer for her!�

The greatest bed ever.
I am a disabled Veteran with paraplegia and this bed is a life saver. I have endured five surgeries on my back and setting the bed the most comfortable after surgery is worth any price the bed may cost but fortunately the cost is very reasonable for what you get.  Complete adjustable ;for each partner in the bed. What more could you ask for? Why waste your money on another mattress when it will be worn out is six years and have to be replaced in about that time. I have mine for some 25 years & it still looks new plus it now has the new upgraded adjustable bed frame.

Wonderful Addition To Our Bedroom!
We have been sleeping on our new S-Cape Adjustable bed for a little over one month and we wonder how we ever slept without it? There are so many nice features on this bed which really turn sleeping into a luxury experience. I like to move the head of the bed upwards to sit up and watch tv and also to read before bed. I also like to turn on the massage and it puts me to sleep at night - I have it set on a timer so it turns off on its own. If I had a hard day at work, I like to raise the foot of the bed to improve the circulation in my legs - it feels great. It comes with 2 lighted remote controls which is nice - you can adjust your position in the dark. We are extremely pleased with our purchase. I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance your sleeping experience and quality of life. Plushbeds was wonderful from beginning to end - very knowledgeable staff, they helped us select the perfect bed.

We Absolutely Love It!
We are very happy that we took the leap and purchased this foundation from Plushbeds. We were nervous at first but called and the mattress specialist was very knowledgeable and nice. He took the time to answer all of our questions (and we had many). When the adjustable frame arrived, we were excited to set it up and test it out. It is heavenly! I like going to sleep with the massage on a timer so I don't have to worry about shutting it off. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up when I watch tv at night. We are having fun testing out all of the fun features on the remotes. We absolutely love it. My experience with Plushbeds and this Adjustable Foundation has been excellent from beginning to end.

Very nice bed
This is a very nice bed. It has turned my bedroom into a luxurious oasis! I look forward to going to bed every night. I like to run the massage for 20 minutes each night - it helps me fall asleep. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up each morning for my coffee and newspaper before I start my day. It's nice to not have to prop up pillow to do this anymore. I can just press a button and it is instant. I wish I bought this bed sooner.

SCape adjustable bed
We received our SCape in a very short time after ordering. Two men put it all together, including hauling it into the house from a truck, assembly of the two halves, putting on the mattress parts, mattress cover, sheets, etc. in two hours with absolutely NO problems.  Works great.  I think we will very much enjoy this adjustable bed.

Company History

                    J.P. Leggett and C.B. Platt were both residents of Carthage, a county seat 
                    in southwest Missouri, when they formed their business partnership in 1883. 
                

                    J.P. Leggett was an inventor and had several patents to his credit. When he 
                    developed the idea for a spiral steel coil bedspring, he went to his future 
                    brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, for his manufacturing capability and expertise. 
                

                    Together they produced the L&P bedspring, patented in 1885, which offered 
                    the best night's sleep yet available. 
                

                    Their partnership prospered and the business was incorporated in 1901. The 
                    company has operated continuously since then, and began its fifth decade of 
                    public ownership in 2017.
                

                    The modern growth era for the company began in the 1960s, when an executive 
                    management team assumed leadership. Being substantially invested in Leggett & Platt
                    stock, then and now, management developed a plan to enhance the potential for 
                    long-term growth. The strategy is a proven success, resulting in leading 
                    manufacturing, marketing, and distribution capabilities.
                

                    Today, we are serving more customers, with more products, and more growth opportunities 
                    than ever before.

Company history[edit]




J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt


In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.


Bedspring vs. Innerspring


At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.


Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.


The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.




The Platt Plow Works


The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.
Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.




Innerspring mattress components


In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett & Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.




J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent


Even greater success followed, and Leggett & Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett & Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company became part of the S&P 500 Index.
Today, Leggett & Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

Company history[edit]




J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt


In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.


Bedspring vs. Innerspring


At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.


Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.


The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.




The Platt Plow Works


The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.
Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.




Innerspring mattress components


In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett & Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.




J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent


Even greater success followed, and Leggett & Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett & Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company became part of the S&P 500 Index.
Today, Leggett & Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

Company history[edit]




J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt


In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.


Bedspring vs. Innerspring


At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.


Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.


The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.




The Platt Plow Works


The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.
Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.




Innerspring mattress components


In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett & Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.




J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent


Even greater success followed, and Leggett & Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett & Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company became part of the S&P 500 Index.
Today, Leggett & Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

120-Night Risk-Free Trial
Advanced, Elegance and Memory Foam Number Beds






Let’s be honest. Visiting a mattress retailer often means going back and forth between mattresses, and even then, you don’t really get to try out each mattress for more than a few minutes. That’s why Personal Comfort™ bed is setting a new standard for mattress buying by allowing our customers to try out our bed for a full 120 nights. Generally, your body takes roughly 3-4 weeks before it adjusts to your new sleeping surface. We believe that you need a full 120 nights to try out any new mattress. We’re so confident Personal Comfort™  Bed is the right choice for you that we’re willing to offer it truly risk free. If for whatever reason you’re not completely satisfied with your Personal Comfort™ bed, you may return your mattress purchase for a full refund on your mattress.
Selecting the right mattress can be a difficult process with several factors that determine your final decision. We invite you to do your homework and compare all number bed manufacturers. You’ll find that our largest competitor, Sleep Number® bed, only offers their customers a 100-night trial. We stand behind our products and believe in the Personal Comfort™ bed so much that we’re willing to let you try it out for 120 nights. When you’re ready to start your trial, our Sleep Specialists are here help you select the right mattress based on comfort, support, expectations, and your budget.


In some cases, budget can determine which mattress you start with, and there is a good chance you may not have selected the correct mattress from the start. That said, you may be eligible to participate in our Comfort Exchange Policy. What’s more, each of our mattresses can be upgraded or downgraded at anytime during your trial period. We stand behind our products and take pride in the fact that we strive to offer our customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee. When you make a decision to purchase a number bed from Personal Comfort™, we will do whatever it takes to continue to earn your business and your referrals.
All of us at Personal Comfort™ understand your need for a better night’s sleep, and that’s why we allow you to try our bed – in the comfort of your own home – for a period of 120 risk free nights. *Limit one trial per customer, per household. Select models not available in trial period. Please see terms of use page for the most accurate and up to date information on trial periods. Mattress must be returned in "like new" condition and pass inspection to be eligible for a full refund. 120-Night Risk-Free Trial excludes Classic Series.
For more information about products covered under our 120-Night Risk Free Trial, click here.






Your comfort is guaranteed!






100% satisfaction guaranteed with our comfort exchange policy

Personal Comfort™ Bed sets the industry standard by providing our customers a 100% satisfaction guarantee: a risk-free buying decision accompanied by a comfort exchange policy. The Personal Comfort™  bed is fully adjustable and has all available comfort settings in one single mattress.
However, if you’re not happy with you’re choice, it may be because of the different levels of comfort foam selected over the support of the air chamber core. Foam and fabrics are very expensive and can easily increase your budget, so it’s important to speak to a Sleep Specialist to help determine what upgrades get you closer to the level of comfort you desire.


If you need to take advantage of our comfort exchange policy, we will swap out your mattress with an equal value mattress, one time, and we will even pay for the shipping. Additionally, we will reset your trial period, if you qualify, so you can have enough time to try out the new levels of comfort in your mattress. If you’re still not satisfied, and you qualify for a return, we will refund you 100% of the original purchase price of the mattress. There is a limit of one comfort exchange for one mattress purchased by the same customer.
Our goal: for you to be happy with the way you sleep, thanks to your new number bed mattress.
Click here for more information about our comfort exchange policy.






120-Night Trial

Classic Series Only
Similar to the 120-night risk-free trial, the Personal Comfort®  Bed Classic Series products also qualify for a 120-night trial period, with a $149.00 restock fee. If the mattress you purchased qualifies for this trial, is returned before the expiration of the trial, and passes inspection as "like-new" condition, then a refund minus restocking fee for the mattress will be issued.

Enjoy Luxurious Comfort with Total Control

				The dual massage will soothe you as you rest, and help you ease tension in your body after a long day, while customizable positions ensure you get the rejuvenating environment you desire for any bedroom activity. Enhanced safety features make this luxurious adjustable base a great addition for your home.
			

				The S-Cape's Wallhugger technology makes any comfort adjustment a smooth transition. Simplistic in design without sacrificing in function, you can even put yourself in a position of virtual weightlessness, taking pressure off of your lower back and limbs. Any way you like it is yours as you escape the cares of your day.
			






				Fabulous features to enjoy maximum comfort in bed
			






Wireless, Stand-Up Remote Control
The technologically advanced wireless remote control stands on its own, so you can place it on your nightstand for easy access.




Upholstery

							Our S-Cape adjustable base is upholstered in a gorgeous  
							contemporary gray patterned fabric, making it a great 
							neutral to fit any decor.
						










Dual Massage With On-Off Button
The dual massage, built into the adjustable bed base, means that there are two separate areas at work to soothe you. One loosens up your shoulders and one helps to unburden those hard-working legs. With the touch of a button, you'll get an awesome sensation of all-over relaxation.




Wallhugger® Engineering

							Leggett & Platt's innovation team developed 
							state-of-the-art technology that puts you at the center of  
							the bed's motion. While other adjustable bed bases lift  
							your upper body away from the wall - and away from your  
							nightstand - bases with Wallhugger® engineering lift you  
							up while simultaneously gliding you back. That means your  
							favorite book and the remote control are within reach  
							whenever you're ready for them

It's a Dream!!
After over a year of debating and research, I purchased the Scape split King with a Latex Mattress (specifically for no off-gassing).  I had to communicate with Jo several times in customer service re: timing of delivery and she was fabulous! The bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin box-spring mattress. The mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls. The delivery came when I was working a 24 hour call shift (I'm Nurse-Midwife). My husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it. He wasn't happy about the $$$ I spent on it. (My money). Anyway, I digress.  He agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up. For that reason I ordered the "white glove service" where they set it up for you.  Through a mix-up with our local delivery service, they were unable to set up- just deliver.  I was sweating it because I didn't want to ask my husband for help.  So, at 0500 after a stressful day of work I came home to find the delivery. EEG!! So exciting!  My husband was asleep in the guest room and I set to work.  I open the two adjustable bases. The instructions were super clear and easy. I popped on the legs and wheels. I rolled the beds over and shoved them into place. I plugged them in to test them. Perfect. I rebuilt my bed frame around the Split King Scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the bases...all 137 lbs of me. No problem.  I did use a 3" foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress. I just cut it in half with scissors.  Put sheets on, showered and did what I couldn't wait to do...I fell into that bed and raised the feet up!!  My poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of God!! (In fact, we refer to our bed as the HOG (Hand of God) because if feels like the heavens opened up and God stretched out His hands to cradle you to sleep! My husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was (I was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor) and saw that I had assembled everything in about an hour.  He is now in love with the bed (of course). He has used a C-Pap since he was 25 years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea.  Before this bed, I woke up feeling like I had been beaten with a 2x4.  I thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years.  Now post-bed, I do NOT have those morning aches and pains. I LOVE THIS BED. I'm glad I bit the bullet and purchased one now. Highly recommend to anyone.  But, if you are a nurse, do yourself a favor and get an adjustable bed. 13 hour shifts are brutal. You deserve it!!!! 10 stars.

Life changer for my mother
My mother is older and spends more time in bed than ever before. She needed help propping up pillows under her head to watch tv and under her legs when she sleeps at night. It is very easy to use and now she can raise the head or foot of her bed with the touch of a button. She enjoys the massage feature as well. It's a life changer for her!�

The greatest bed ever.
I am a disabled Veteran with paraplegia and this bed is a life saver. I have endured five surgeries on my back and setting the bed the most comfortable after surgery is worth any price the bed may cost but fortunately the cost is very reasonable for what you get.  Complete adjustable ;for each partner in the bed. What more could you ask for? Why waste your money on another mattress when it will be worn out is six years and have to be replaced in about that time. I have mine for some 25 years & it still looks new plus it now has the new upgraded adjustable bed frame.

Wonderful Addition To Our Bedroom!
We have been sleeping on our new S-Cape Adjustable bed for a little over one month and we wonder how we ever slept without it? There are so many nice features on this bed which really turn sleeping into a luxury experience. I like to move the head of the bed upwards to sit up and watch tv and also to read before bed. I also like to turn on the massage and it puts me to sleep at night - I have it set on a timer so it turns off on its own. If I had a hard day at work, I like to raise the foot of the bed to improve the circulation in my legs - it feels great. It comes with 2 lighted remote controls which is nice - you can adjust your position in the dark. We are extremely pleased with our purchase. I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance your sleeping experience and quality of life. Plushbeds was wonderful from beginning to end - very knowledgeable staff, they helped us select the perfect bed.

We Absolutely Love It!
We are very happy that we took the leap and purchased this foundation from Plushbeds. We were nervous at first but called and the mattress specialist was very knowledgeable and nice. He took the time to answer all of our questions (and we had many). When the adjustable frame arrived, we were excited to set it up and test it out. It is heavenly! I like going to sleep with the massage on a timer so I don't have to worry about shutting it off. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up when I watch tv at night. We are having fun testing out all of the fun features on the remotes. We absolutely love it. My experience with Plushbeds and this Adjustable Foundation has been excellent from beginning to end.

Very nice bed
This is a very nice bed. It has turned my bedroom into a luxurious oasis! I look forward to going to bed every night. I like to run the massage for 20 minutes each night - it helps me fall asleep. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up each morning for my coffee and newspaper before I start my day. It's nice to not have to prop up pillow to do this anymore. I can just press a button and it is instant. I wish I bought this bed sooner.

SCape adjustable bed
We received our SCape in a very short time after ordering. Two men put it all together, including hauling it into the house from a truck, assembly of the two halves, putting on the mattress parts, mattress cover, sheets, etc. in two hours with absolutely NO problems.  Works great.  I think we will very much enjoy this adjustable bed.

								USDA / GOLS Certified Organic Latex
							

							As America's largest distributor of ARPICO organic latex, PlushBeds brings the world's finest latex directly from ARPICO's certified organic plantations to your bedroom. More expensive than natutal talalay latex or traditional dunlop, certified organic latex as per the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is latex that has been processed using only organically-grown, milky-white latex sap tapped from the rubber tree grown without chemicals, fertilizers, or pesticides, as well as being grown using one or more sustainable energy sources.
							Unlike talalay latex, which is infused with excess air to be light and   fluffy (ideal for pillows and top comfort layers), organic  latex   provides a heavier and more dense mattress core which is where the   support of your mattress comes from. The core is the largest, most   expensive component of a latex mattress and a high quality core can be   the difference between years of long lasting support or unpleasant   sagging indentations after a short period of time.                                                        

				While you'll sometimes find what appear to be great deals on 
				latex mattresses 
				claiming to be "organic", be sure that the true value bears that out, and that the retailer can produce the necessary documentation.

								100% Natural Talalay Latex Comfort Layer
							

								Right underneath your mattress's organic cotton cover is a plush comfort layer of the world's finest 100% natural talalay latex, which offers a pressure-reducing, buoyant sensation found only with 100% natural talalay latex. 
							

								Talalay latex is an effective barrier to dust mite allergen transfer and so it can help you sleep better! Dust mites are the #1 source of indoor allergens which may lead to sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion. This latex provides the highest quality, most consistent, breathable and resilient comforting latex available in the world.

								Non-Woven Organic Cotton Cover
							

								Breathe...deeply...it's, soft, high-quality 100% GOTS certified organic cotton. With unsurpassed non-restricted airflow, moisture absorption, breathability, and environmental safety, your Botanical Bliss latex mattress cover also provides more safety, environmental integrity and care because the cotton was grown without any dangerous pesticides or herbicides. Non-Woven mattress covers are softer, more breathable, more elastic, offer better moisture control, and provide better pressure relief than woven covers.

								100% Pure New Zealand Wool - No Chemical Flame Retardants
							

								Every Botanical Bliss is made in the USA with up to 10 pounds of Pure New Zealand wool - over three times what competitors use - allowing your body to get to a comfortable sleeping temperature quicker and maintain it through the night. Our Pure New Zealand Wool breathes more naturally than synthetic counterparts and creates a micro climate which assists in regulating body temperature and humidity, allowing your body to get to a comfortable sleeping temperature quicker and maintain it through the night.

								GreenGuard Gold Certified
							

Unlike most of our competitors, our entire mattress is GreenGuard Gold Certified as a low-emitting product. Through rigorous testing, UL Environment certifies our mattresses meet some of the world's most rigorous, third-party chemical emissions standards with strict low emission limits for over 360 volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Our Mattresses get reviewed quarterly to maintain this seal of approval. By being certified at the Gold level, our mattresses are beneficial for sensitive individuals such as children and the elderly.

MONEY BACK GUARANTEE



								Where a 100 Night Risk Free trial is truly Risk Free

								From the day your mattress is delivered, you have 100 nights to fall in love with it. If after the first 30 days you decide that your new mattress is not for you, simply call us to arrange a pickup. We'll send our carriers to your house to pick up your mattress. Once we receive your mattress, a full refund of the purchase price will be refunded back to you. Please note white glove delivery fees or other shipping upgrades are not refundable.

The Botanical Bliss™ 100% All Natural Latex Mattress.



														When you upgrade to today's luxury mattress standards, you'll want a bed that's 100% natural, chemical free, 
														luxuriously comfortable, and long-lasting. Our slideshow will explain why we give you the quality, luxury, 
														and eco-friendly comfort that no other mattress company can.
													

  
You're about to see why after comparison shopping for a chemical free 100% natural mattress, more people choose 
														our Botanical Bliss™ 100% natural latex mattress over any other brand. PlushBeds gives you what no other mattress 
														can...an organically pure sleep surface and a clear conscience.













1. The Botanical Bliss™ latex mattress collection only contains 100% certified natural latex


While most "Latex Mattresses" sold today are promoted as "100% latex", but contain synthetic latex made from petrochemical products which have limited elasticity, Plushbeds is proud to offer 100% Natural Sri Lankan Botanical Latex with no synthetic blends or petroleum based products. With a more dense, supportive 100% natural dunlop core to prevent sagging and a less-dense top layer of 100% natural talalay latex for maximum pressure relief, you receive a mattress that offers optimized pressure relief and uncompromising support, resulting in deeper, restorative sleep.

  
	The Botanical Bliss™latex mattress offers the perfect combination of resilient support and pressure relief that can only be found with a solid 100% natural latex mattress.













2. PlushBeds offers the softest, finest quality Organic Cotton online.


Aside from the latex used in the mattress, the mattress cover is the next most important, yet most overlooked component to compare. Several online mattress retailers boast the use of organic cotton; however fail to mention its the cheaper, mass-produced woven organic cotton. Woven fabrics are tight, course and do not stretch, hindering the pressure-relieving benefits of natural latex.

  
	PlushBeds exclusive knitted mattress covers are softer, more breathable, more elastic, offer better moisture control, and provide better pressure relief than the mass produced woven covers used by our competitors.













3. Our Botanical Bliss™ uses a Pure New Zealand Wool fire barrier.



															Unlike competitors who use harsh fire retardants, our Botanical Bliss covers are created with soft Pure New Zealand Wool. 
															The Botanical Bliss mattress is ideal for those who suffer from feather, down, or synthetic bedding products 
															allergies. Our quilted mattress covers are naturally fire-resistant, ensure natural temperature regulation, are hypoallergenic, 
															antimicrobial, and are dust mite resistant.
														

  

																Our Botanical Bliss mattresses are protected by all-natural, Pure New Zealand Wool for its supportive qualities 
																to extra sensitive allergy requirements, as well as for its softness and comfort.
															














												4. No Smelly Glues...or adhesives of any kind. Our layers of natural latex are removable to adjust comfort.
											



														True 100% natural latex doesn't need to be glued; competitors who glue their layers may not be using 100% natural latex. 
														PlushBeds offers removable, adjustable layers so you can simply unzip your cover and rotate your layers of latex to adjust 
														the firmness of your mattress.
													

  
With un-glued latex layers, you can easily adjust your mattress firmness by changing a layer of latex without having to 
														return the whole mattress














												5. PlushBeds has a Rock Solid Reputation
											



														When you buy a natural latex mattress, you are making an investment in your sleep, your bodys revitalization, and your health. Like any investment, it's wise to look at the reputation of the company you are considering buying from. Are they an accredited business with the Better Business Bureau? How many complaints have been filed against them by other customers before you? This can be easily found by going to the Better Business Bureau and entering the name of the companies you've considered. A company's past track record is a good indication of what you might expect should problems arise after you've made your purchase.
													

  

															PlushBeds has a rock solid reputation and hundreds of readable reviews from verified customers.
														














												6. 4 different firmnesses available on every Botanical Bliss mattress.
											



														PlushBeds is not just a mattress retailer, but also the manufacturer. This gives us a broad range of options in the comfort levels we can offer. Where most internet retailers are limited to a single firmness per mattress model, PlushBeds offers 4 different firmnesses for each latex mattress we sell. Additionally, because each mattress is custom made, we can accommodate virtually any request. Need a specific height or specific firmness (ILD) that you don't see online? Just give is a call, and we'll be glad to assist in building a custom-made latex mattress that is just right for you.
													

  

															All Botanical Blis™ latex mattresses are available in 4 different firmnesses and are custom made, offering you more options to choosing the perfect mattress.
														














												7. 100 Night Comfort Exchange Program
											



														Wherever you decide to buy your latex mattress from, we hope you choose the correct firmness the first time around, but what if it's too soft or too firm? Most online companies glue their layers together, in fact, as many as 4 cups of glue are used in a single "all natural" latex mattress. If the firmness is not what you had hoped, what are your options? Your only option is to re-package the mattress and ship it back. The PlushBeds comfort exchange program offers an affordable and convenient solution to adjusting your mattress firmness without the hassle of having to return the whole mattress.
													

 

													Free of any shipping fees, we'll send you a new layer of natural latex in a different firmness, which 9 times out of 10 will solve a comfort issue without having to return your mattress.
														














												8. Easy, 100 Night FREE Mattress Returns
											



														If after 30 days you decide that your Plushbeds latex mattress is not for you, just call us within your first 100 nights and we'll pick up the mattress and bonus items for a full refund of your purchase price. Many competitors tell you they will "take the mattress back" but you will be required to pay return shipping costs ($300 - $500), restocking fees, or "damage fees", to be determined by the company after they receive your mattress back
													

 

														Every Botanical Bliss™ latex mattress comes with our famous 100 night Free return policy. We'll pay the return shipping costs for a curbside pickup, and you'll receive a full refund of your purchase price.
														














												9. Industry's Strongest 25 Year Warranty
											



														Plushbeds guarantees that your latex mattress will be replaced or repaired at our option, should it be deemed defective because of faulty workmanship or structural defects for a period of 25 years beginning on the date of delivery, with 100% coverage for 10 full years, and pro-rated in years 11-25. The latex mattresses we deliver to our customers are the same latex mattresses we sleep on ourselves, which is why we are proud to offer the strongest 25 year manufacturer's warranty in the industry.
													

  

																
													All Botanical Bliss™ latex mattresses are protected for 25 years from faulty workmanship or structural defects.
														














												10. It's the Latex Mattress Recommended by Professionals
											



														Our 100% natural latex mattresses are often recommended by orthopedic specialists and chiropractors. 
													The mix of pressure -relieving softness and buoyant support offered by our hypo-allergenic natural construction makes botanical latex an ideal bedding material. Don't settle for a synthetic or hybrid option when choosing all-natural botanical latex can prove to be one of the best investments for your health and longevity. 
													

														A latex mattress isn't a cure-all, and a website recommendation should never replace a visit to your doctor.
													

 

															Our 100% natural latex mattresses are often recommended by orthopedic specialists and chiropractors because of the unequaled support they provide.

The perfect mattress
I am 140 and a side sleeper. I ordered the 9" Botanical Bliss in soft but after a month, I decided it was too soft for me. I did the comfort exchange to the medium and it has made a nice difference. I am 100% satisfied. Great mattress. Gives great pain relief on your body. Feels good.

Still Happy
We were skeptical about ordering online, a mattress we had never tried, and the generally positive reviews for Plushbeds made me wonder if the reviews were screened, but I figured in the end, the return policy was solid, and you never really know a mattress until you sleep on it for a few days... but that was a year ago, and we still exclaim our love for this bed multiple times per week, if not every night.

Love our mattress!!!
We were incredibly hesitant to purchase a mattress online, but all of the positive reviews convinced my husband and I to take a leap of faith and we are so glad we did! We got the 9" Botanical Bliss in Medium/Firm with the orthopedic foundation. We are side and back sleepers and the support has been great for both of us. We've been sleeping on our new mattress for 4 months now and we're amazed at how much more comfortable it has been in comparison to our old innerspring pillowtop mattress. No more restless, sleepless nights, no more pain and discomfort in the morning, and no more allergies!! Side note, the unboxing process is pretty amusing--- so crazy that they can squeeze a queen sized mattress into such a tiny box! Just a heads up, the mattress is a bit heavy and floppy, so it's not easy to move around once it's rolled out. The foundation is sturdy and we were able to assemble it quickly and easily. The included supportive latex pillows and super soft Egyptian cotton sheets were an awesome added bonus! Our bed is sooooo comfy now and we would highly recommend giving a PlushBeds mattress a try. 5 stars all around for ultimate comfort, quality products, great value, fast shipping, and excellent customer service!

A+ customer service, great company
I was in a car accident and require a very hard mattress. I ordered the extra-firm mattress but after trying it out for a couple months, I decided that the mattress just wasn't offering the support that I needed. Customer service was wonderful. I returned the mattress for a full refund. It was easy and quick.

After one year, still recommend to anyone
After 30 yrs of marriage, we had been through too many spring coil beds every few years and tired of throwing away money and one of us uncomfortable always.  We knew he liked firm and I liked softer, so we got two Plushbed twin xls to make a king size together.  softer for me and firmer for him, and no need for rising and lowering function, just simple foundation box.  My husband was mortified that it came out of a box through the mail without trying it in a store as I ordered it based upon the reviews.  He now admits it was the best bed we have ever had.  No more hip pain for me as a side sleeper.

Good Mattress, Great Customer Service
I hadn't ever heard of a latex mattress before.  I finally found out what I was missing out on when my hubby decided we should get one after visiting a home show.  We don't buy stuff on the spot, so we went home and learned more about latex mattresses.  He selected one off of the Plushbeds.com website, it's the 9 botanical bliss. My husband likes a firm mattress. We called and asked for the extra firm. When we received it, it was a little too firm. We did the free comfort exchange and got the medium firm. It is great. We are very happy customers. Highly recommended. Great customer service.

Couldn't live without my Botanical Bliss!
I'm not really a materialistic person, and I try not to focus my attention on things, but instead on people and my relationships.  However, if there is one thing that I couldn't do without, it's my botanical bliss latex mattress from Plush Beds! I've never had this much luxury and comfort in my life.

No More Sheep to Count
We've had this mattress for less than a month, and we're already planning to replace the one in our daughter's room with another latex mattress from Plushbeds. It's really nice to know you can rely on being able to sleep like a baby every night. Who knew that all we needed was a great mattress? The company was very easy to deal with too, and they have a great guarantee.

Soft support - AWESOME Egyption cotton sheets... zzzzzzzz
It took me a week or so to adjust to a bed that actually supported correctly and was comfortable.  After that adjustment period I slept so well.. and normally, I sleep well, but this is better.The ONE CON: this thing is a BEAST to move around! Tell the wife she doesn't get to change her mind 5 times on where the bed goes and which direction... almost impossible to move by yourself! ...but other than that it's great!  NO smell. NO break in period. (Also the sheets that came with it for the add in deal... are wicked soft! Well done!)

Excellent Company
I've been sleeping on the Botanical Bliss mattress for exactly a month.  I love it.   I never thought I'd make such an important purchase online.  I couldn't find a pure latex mattress locally.  When I read their return policy which meant I wouldn't lose any money if I didn't like it, I decided to try it.  I have asked so many friends to come and try it out that I'm sure they think I'm a nut case.   After ten days, I decided it was too hard for me...I had chosen the medium firm.  I called Plush Beds and they immediately sent me a softer replacement for the 2" topper and it is perfect now. It's a wonderful bed.  Don't be afraid to try it.  You have nothing to lose because they'll take it back if you don't like it---but you will like it.

The Best!
I purchased the 9" Organic Botanical Bliss and, yestalk about bliss, I've never slept better.  Thisbed is super comfortable and from someone who has chronic lower back pain, this is remarkable. I have the orthopedicfoundation and Prestige bed frame.  I've just ordered a 3"organic latex topper because I want the bed a little higher (12" is a better size to get).  I also ordered the 3" extender kit for the bed frame glides.  Note that this latex has absolutely no smell out of the package, a big plus for me. The customer service and product expertise is is excellent.  I researched latex beds for over a year and I finally chose Plushbeds, and I am super glad I did for their great service and product.  I know you can't find a better Organic, Latex bed at an affordable price than at Plushbeds.  I got the Cyber Monday deal!  Their 25 year bed warranty and 100 day comfort exchange is hard to beat.

very expensive mistake
Admittedly comfort if very subjective....but this was a very disappointing purchase. I bought bed approx 2 years ago- usually wake up in more back and hip pain than I went to bed with. The problem is that the mattress is rigid- not firm with support nor comfy with give.....somehow it manages to not be supportive yet also doesnt flex to body contours. I spent a lot of time researching because I wanted the least toxic, most environmentally friend mattress I could afford. I think the materials do meet that criteria. I did try the comfort exchange, but by the time the new layer came, I tried it, decided I didnt like it, it was too late to return. I was prompted to write this review as plush beds came up when I was internet searching for a mattress topper- to try to make bed tolerable. oh well.

I can attest to the fine quality. bona fide, the real McCoy
They're the real deal. The way Plushbeds makes their mattresses is really neat.  When I got my mattress, the 9-inch bliss latex mattress, I unzipped it to inspect to make sure I wasn't getting a just a top layer of latex with some fillers or generic foam as a core.  Sure enough, it was in layers, and not glued together like some other mattress companies do it.  I can attest to the fine quality and comfort of this mattress. It's perfect.

A Great Mattress at a Great Price
I just want to say a few words of praise for Plushbed's Botanical Bliss Latex Mattress. For the longest time my wife and I both complained about the mattress we were using, without doing anything about it. Sometimes we would get up mornings grumbling about soreness in our backs, shoulders, or sides. A little over a year ago, we finally took action. I talked to one of our neighbors, a chiropractor, and he told us that 100% natural latex is the best. We researched and asked around and found Plushbeds to be the best. We are very pleased with our decision.

Happy
I am 67 years old, short, and have lower back pain due to moderate arthritis. My partner is 57 years old, and doing fine. We did a bunch of research. I hated the sinking into cement feeling of the Tempurpedic, along with the smell. So, we did it. We bought a beautiful platform bed and the 9" Botanical Bliss and LOVE IT. I find myself not wanting to get out of the bed in the morning! Plushbeds says try for 30 days before you decide if you like it. We liked it night one. If this holds up and does not develop a dip, like our Natura mattress did, it will definitely be our best bed and best sleep of all time.

Life-changing
I've struggled with lower back problems for years.  Upon meeting the President of PlushBeds at a conference, he recommended that I needed to try changing to his natural latex beds.  I took his advice, and am incredibly happy that I did.The 9" is plenty supportive (I'm about 200 lbs.).  Instead of sinking into the mattress like you would a memory foam, the mattress is resilient, supporting my body no matter if I am sleeping on my back or side.  It feels like a combination of a memory foam and an inflatable bed...in a good way.  My back pain has been diminished, and I have been waking up unafraid to roll over and get out of bed.  Awesome product and awesome company.

I cannot recommend this company highly enough!
I cannot recommend this company highly enough, both for their products and their service!  There was actually a mistake with my order and this company--especially the wonderful salesperson Judy-- bent over backwards to do everything possible to make sure I was well taken care of.  I was frankly amazed at how great they were.  They truly stand behind their word and their product.

Best rest ever
We ordered the 9" Botanical Bliss split king mattress, medium (24-26 ILD)  with adjustable bed frames for the foundation.  I found the construction quality to be amazing, but the mattresses were far too soft for our comfort. Thanks to Jo, our new best friend at Plush Beds customer service, we were able to exchange the top latex layer for a more firm layer, which provided the firm support and deep sleep experience we were hoping for. My spine stays perfectly aligned when I sleep on my side now. It has a healing effect that completely eliminates the muscle spasms that have been plaguing me when sleeping on other mattresses. My husband loves it as well. I would highly recommend this latex sleep system and the outstanding customer service.

6 months later still very happy
Body types matter to people who wonder if they should take the plunge, so I am female, 140 lb, 60's. I decided to order on line because the guarantee is much better than from a brick-and-mortar store where your money is trapped in that store.  I also could not find all-botanical latex locally. The sales staff asked detailed questions about my sleeping pattern and weight and gave great advice on selecting the perfect mattress for me.

Everything I was looking for!
I searched for MONTHS....researching mattresses! My old mattress was made in the traditional poly foam....TERRIBLE!  I slept so terribly hot and was awake all nite long...trying to cool off.  In my research I learned that latex does not hold heat....and it proved itself 100%!  I am about 2 weeks into this new mattress....and I haven't slept so well in years!  I am extremely happy!!!  I ordered medium firm....and it is not at all too stiff. It supports as well as gives.  LOVE IT!  Yes I would definitely recommend this mattress and have!  My only dislike...was in the pillows that did come with the bed. They were shreaded latex and I am a solid latex pillow sleeper...but I did want to try them to compare.  I think they would be fine for many, but because I have ALWAYS been a solid latex pillow person....it just didn't compare for me.  Great experience in all!

This Bed is Amazing!!
I am a side sleeper and ordered the medium firm. It was too firm for me. I did the comfort exchange and swapped it for the medium which is perfect for me. It gives my hips and shoulder more comfort when sleeping on my side.

First class company, product, pricing and customer service all in one place
We couldn't be happier. Our 9-inch Botanical Bliss latex mattress is the finest we've ever owned,.. very plush but totally supportive... Ahh, the comfort... perfect! Your prices were unbeatable anywhere on-line or at local bedding stores (and believe me we shopped hard). Also, your detail-rich website and company guarantees were critical in our decision-making. But most of all, your excellent customer service was the icing on the cake.

Very comfortable and soothing to the body
We've had our Plushbeds mattress for about 3 months, and we love it. It is very comfortable and It has eased my husband's lower back pain. It relives all pressure points and gives a nice support on your lower back - very soothing to the body. I fall asleep instantly and sleep throughout the night - (no more tossing and turning like I did on our old coil mattress). We spoke with Samantha on chat when deciding which mattress to order. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. Great customer service. Wonderful company and mattress. We are very happy.

The 9" medium firm botanical bliss mattress was the product I ordered. Everything arrived as advertised, and overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase. The "medium firm" mattress is definitely a bit firmer than one would expect. It's really more like a  firm mattress by department store standards, but the comfort exchange to the natural soft 2" topper gave the mattress just the touch of extra softness I wanted. Customer service was excellent, and I had my comfort exchange processed very quickly.

We did a lot of research before buying, and like everyone else, we were nervous about ordering online.  We've had our Botanical Bliss mattress for a year and a half now, and we've been very happy with it.  I highly recommend it!

Reduced Back Pain
It seems like so many people have back pain. I still do to too, but this latex mattress solved a lot of my pain problem, since I hardly have lower back pain anymore. It's heavier than I thought it would be, but probably weighs less than my other mattress did after it was filled with dead skin, LOL! Customer service was excellent, I've already referred my sister to your company.

Amazing mattress!! Last one I will own!
Fantastic Bed. Natural 100% Certified natural latex with no nasty chemical smell. Smells fresh and natural when opened up. Very easy setup, just unroll, add your topper, get those organic sheets on and enjoy the comfort with the added latex shredded pillows for perfect support of the neck and spine. My synthetic foam mattress went straight to the curb after sitting in the living room for just a day. That's how long it took me to realize this was the best purchase I made for my health. One third of your life is spent on a mattress sleeping, why wouldn't you want to sleep healthily without breathing toxic voc's with synthetic made chemicals. The liquid proof mattress cover is a nice bonus incase my puppy has an accident. No stains or smell are headed to the organic cotton zipper cover. Very pleased overall with the purchase and happy to take 5 minutes to add my review and hopefully have an impact on someone or a whole bunch of people's health. Shipping was super fast too. I couldn't have been happier!

Soft, comfortable &  supportive!
Growing up I slept on latex mattresses, forgot how comfortable they were, but as a child you wouldn't notice, right.  Now that I'm 65+ and a bed can make all the difference on how you feel when you sleep & when you get up,  my new 9" Botanical Bliss gives me a good nights sleep without waking up because I am feeling those pressure points hurting.  I feel well rested when I get up in the morning and am ready to start my day.  A little expensive, but the bed will last the rest of my life, my parents slept on their latex mattress for 50 years.

Sleeping like a baby
We thought about exchanging our med-firm bed a few times. I thought it was too hard the first 2 days. Our doctor recommended that we try a little longer and said that a little discomfort was normal. After the first week, sleeping on my back felt great! Can't wait to go to wake up and realize that I really slept ALL NIGHT without pain. LOVE this bed.

Fantastic
I ordered a medium firm 9" Botanical Bliss mattress and decided it was too firm.  I spoke with Jolene in customer service and decided to try the free comfort exchange to a regular medium. The medium is perfect and the comfort exchange was quick and easy to do! I have had the most wonderful sleep on this mattress. No back pain whatsoever. Jolene was wonderful and so is my new mattress. Couldn't be happier!

Botanical Bliss
All personnel I talked to were professional, helpful and courteous. I originally ordered a too firm a mattress and exchange was seamless and prompt. Both my wife and I are happy with mattresses and adjustable bases. We have since ordered a Bontanical Bliss for my Mother in law and she love it as well.

Thrilled with my purchase
My family and I live an organic lifestyle. It was important for me to have an organic mattress since we spend approximately 25 years of our life sleeping. Most non-organic mattresses contain chemicals and there are long-term health effects that may occur after prolonged exposure to these chemicals including cancers, damage to the heart, liver, central nervous system and kidneys. This is not something that I want my family breathing in every night. I did a lot of research and checked out all certifications. I found Plushbeds to be the best. 100% natural latex and organic with all certifications, including Greenguard Gold (not many mattresses have this, it was great to see). I ordered three of the 9" Botanical Bliss mattresses for all 3 bedrooms in our home. We received them 9 days after we placed the order and they were everything that we had hoped they would be. When we unwrapped the boxes, there were no odors at all. The mattresses were easy to set up and after 3 months of sleeping on them, we are thrilled! Very comfortable, feels great on my lower back and body. I sleep so well on this mattress. It feels great to go to sleep each night knowing that my family and I are not breathing in dangerous chemicals or fumes. We are very happy with Plushbeds and this mattress!

Good investment, we think at 1 week
We got 2 Twin XLs to place on the Prodigy 2.0 split King adjustable bed. Excellent night sleep even on first night, though hard to sort out what part is due to the mattress and what part to the adjustable bed base. At least in theory, a purely organic bed and bed covers/sheets, etc without chemicals is attractive. Hardest part of the mattress purchase is guessing at firmness that will be best. We got 1 med & 1 med-firm - will take more time to decide if one of them should be change to the other. But after less than a week conclusion is it was a good purchase that is good for our health, our backs, and our comfort. Both the mattress & bases have long warranties so hopefully the $5-6K cost is divided over much more than a decade. At this point, we think it was a good choice.

Great Mattress
Have been sleeping on our new Botanical Bliss for 3 weeks now and I am here to sing your praises! Had chronic hip and shoulder pain for several years and this mattress has made such a nice difference. I am a side sleeper and feel no pain when sleeping on my side in this mattress. Great pressure relief and cushioning!

Best Sleep In Years
Here is the amazing thing about this mattress: it almost feels like you're floating & there is nothing beneath you and yet you feel completely supported. I guess it's because you can't feel any pressure points no matter what position you sleep in. The Plushbeds customer service department answered all my questions, and the purchase and delivery went very smoothly, too.

So happy I decided to go for it!
I've been struggling with lower back muscle issues and have gone through two other mattresses in the past 4 years.  This bed surpassed my expectations.  I was nervous when it appeared rolled up in a box, but when the plastic wrap came off and it "settled", I inserted my med firm middle and had one of the best sleeps in a long time!  Very impressed with service, delivery and quality.

Good customer service
Overall the bed is very supportive, it's just not what my husband and I was looking for. I also feel that 9" is too thin for a mattress. However, the customer service at plushbeds was exceptional! I got fast responses and easy return process. Good place to purchase a mattress if you are really fond of latex!

best yet!
My husband and I saw this mattress, the botanical bliss, which was advertised online by plushbeds. after having bad results from other mattress companies in the past ( theirs either sunk in the middle after a few months, became  lumpy or way too soft after a few months,)  we tried plushbeds botanical bliss in the xtra firm WE LOVE IT!    it has stayed firm and we get a good  sleep each nite. Only wish we had found this sooner. They were polite and helpful in regards to putting it together, which was no problem at all, We would highly recommend them.   Mr & Mrs Kuty

We are ecstatic
I cannot describe the soothing and healing feel you get when you sleep on this mattress. I sit at a desk all day and my lower back is always achy. I'm a back sleeper and chose the medium firm. It gives great support but it also feels cushioned. It takes all of the pressure off my back. Amazing feeling. Great mattress.

9Inch Botanical Bliss
This mattress is a dream come true. 29-31 is firm enough for me.  I am 160 pounds, try to loose some, but this firmness is for  250pounds.  It is great support for my back.  I used to cry and scream during many nights because of spasm in my both legs.  Since I sleep on the 9" Botanical Bliss I have not have to cry or scream since.  If you are looking for new mattress go with Botanical Bliss, because their price is better.  The one 1" of wool on top of mattress and gooses down comforter will make your body feel nice and warm.  Looking for combination 29-31 with a 2" medium on top will take you to heaven whole night long.  Good luck and share your experience if you try my combination. I would love to hear it.

Very Pleased 
I too like so many on here, was skeptical about ordering a bed online.  One thing I did was throw out my old steel bed frame and had to retrieve it back as stupidly I thought the foundation came with a frame or something, but it is the slates that the mattress actually sits on.  Anyway after unrolling the huge heavy mattress my firest thought was why does it look so slim?  Well that is because I ordered the 9" mattress and just assumed it would look like the picture of the one on here (looks like a very big thick matress but it is not).Now that I've had a few days to sleep on the Medium firm one I ordered, I do love it.  It does cradle to my body's pressure points and is a wonderful and healthy sleep.So happy I purchased it now.  Another extremely satisfied customer.. OH you will want to purchase a mattress protector, I thought it came protected or something as I asked the sales lady she said yes.. so you have to go purchase one somewhere separately.On the free pillows sent, you can fold them in half, so I don't know how they will support your neck or head, but haven't tried them yet.

Enjoy Luxurious Comfort with Total Control

				The dual massage will soothe you as you rest, and help you ease tension in your body after a long day, while customizable positions ensure you get the rejuvenating environment you desire for any bedroom activity. Enhanced safety features make this luxurious adjustable base a great addition for your home.
			

				The S-Cape's Wallhugger technology makes any comfort adjustment a smooth transition. Simplistic in design without sacrificing in function, you can even put yourself in a position of virtual weightlessness, taking pressure off of your lower back and limbs. Any way you like it is yours as you escape the cares of your day.
			






				Fabulous features to enjoy maximum comfort in bed
			






Wireless, Stand-Up Remote Control
The technologically advanced wireless remote control stands on its own, so you can place it on your nightstand for easy access.




Upholstery

							Our S-Cape adjustable base is upholstered in a gorgeous  
							contemporary gray patterned fabric, making it a great 
							neutral to fit any decor.
						










Dual Massage With On-Off Button
The dual massage, built into the adjustable bed base, means that there are two separate areas at work to soothe you. One loosens up your shoulders and one helps to unburden those hard-working legs. With the touch of a button, you'll get an awesome sensation of all-over relaxation.




Wallhugger® Engineering

							Leggett & Platt's innovation team developed 
							state-of-the-art technology that puts you at the center of  
							the bed's motion. While other adjustable bed bases lift  
							your upper body away from the wall - and away from your  
							nightstand - bases with Wallhugger® engineering lift you  
							up while simultaneously gliding you back. That means your  
							favorite book and the remote control are within reach  
							whenever you're ready for them

            Also, does the Legget and Platt S-Cape only come in a King Split, or can you get a regular King that's all one piece?

what the difference between split queen and regular queen ?

                            on May 26, 2017
                        








BEST ANSWER: A queen sized bed is one 60" x 80" bed. The adjustable bed will work as one unit where the entire head and/or foot of bed moves up and down as one unit.A split queen sized bed is (2) separate 30" x 80" beds, side by side. The split queen adjustable bed is also 2 separate beds, side by side. Each side of the adjustable bed has its own remote control and each side moves independently. Both sides can be synced together to use as one unit as well. You should order the same size mattress as the adjustable frame.

It's a Dream!!
After over a year of debating and research, I purchased the Scape split King with a Latex Mattress (specifically for no off-gassing).  I had to communicate with Jo several times in customer service re: timing of delivery and she was fabulous! The bed arrived in two large cardboard boxes about the size of a twin box-spring mattress. The mattresses were compressed and in tight rolls. The delivery came when I was working a 24 hour call shift (I'm Nurse-Midwife). My husband was against the purchase and washed his hands of it. He wasn't happy about the $$$ I spent on it. (My money). Anyway, I digress.  He agreed to accept the delivery but said he would have nothing to do with setting the whole thing up. For that reason I ordered the "white glove service" where they set it up for you.  Through a mix-up with our local delivery service, they were unable to set up- just deliver.  I was sweating it because I didn't want to ask my husband for help.  So, at 0500 after a stressful day of work I came home to find the delivery. EEG!! So exciting!  My husband was asleep in the guest room and I set to work.  I open the two adjustable bases. The instructions were super clear and easy. I popped on the legs and wheels. I rolled the beds over and shoved them into place. I plugged them in to test them. Perfect. I rebuilt my bed frame around the Split King Scape bases and then unrolled my latex mattresses and heaved them up on the bases...all 137 lbs of me. No problem.  I did use a 3" foam topper that we had on our previous king size mattress. I just cut it in half with scissors.  Put sheets on, showered and did what I couldn't wait to do...I fell into that bed and raised the feet up!!  My poor feet were barking from work and it was like being cradled by the hand of God!! (In fact, we refer to our bed as the HOG (Hand of God) because if feels like the heavens opened up and God stretched out His hands to cradle you to sleep! My husband came upstairs to see what the commotion was (I was being really quiet but then accidentally dropped the hammer on the hard wood floor) and saw that I had assembled everything in about an hour.  He is now in love with the bed (of course). He has used a C-Pap since he was 25 years old and finds that just a slight incline of his head helps with his sleep apnea.  Before this bed, I woke up feeling like I had been beaten with a 2x4.  I thought there was no way my body could handle being a midwife for many more years.  Now post-bed, I do NOT have those morning aches and pains. I LOVE THIS BED. I'm glad I bit the bullet and purchased one now. Highly recommend to anyone.  But, if you are a nurse, do yourself a favor and get an adjustable bed. 13 hour shifts are brutal. You deserve it!!!! 10 stars.

Life changer for my mother
My mother is older and spends more time in bed than ever before. She needed help propping up pillows under her head to watch tv and under her legs when she sleeps at night. It is very easy to use and now she can raise the head or foot of her bed with the touch of a button. She enjoys the massage feature as well. It's a life changer for her!�

The greatest bed ever.
I am a disabled Veteran with paraplegia and this bed is a life saver. I have endured five surgeries on my back and setting the bed the most comfortable after surgery is worth any price the bed may cost but fortunately the cost is very reasonable for what you get.  Complete adjustable ;for each partner in the bed. What more could you ask for? Why waste your money on another mattress when it will be worn out is six years and have to be replaced in about that time. I have mine for some 25 years & it still looks new plus it now has the new upgraded adjustable bed frame.

Wonderful Addition To Our Bedroom!
We have been sleeping on our new S-Cape Adjustable bed for a little over one month and we wonder how we ever slept without it? There are so many nice features on this bed which really turn sleeping into a luxury experience. I like to move the head of the bed upwards to sit up and watch tv and also to read before bed. I also like to turn on the massage and it puts me to sleep at night - I have it set on a timer so it turns off on its own. If I had a hard day at work, I like to raise the foot of the bed to improve the circulation in my legs - it feels great. It comes with 2 lighted remote controls which is nice - you can adjust your position in the dark. We are extremely pleased with our purchase. I highly recommend this product if you want to enhance your sleeping experience and quality of life. Plushbeds was wonderful from beginning to end - very knowledgeable staff, they helped us select the perfect bed.

We Absolutely Love It!
We are very happy that we took the leap and purchased this foundation from Plushbeds. We were nervous at first but called and the mattress specialist was very knowledgeable and nice. He took the time to answer all of our questions (and we had many). When the adjustable frame arrived, we were excited to set it up and test it out. It is heavenly! I like going to sleep with the massage on a timer so I don't have to worry about shutting it off. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up when I watch tv at night. We are having fun testing out all of the fun features on the remotes. We absolutely love it. My experience with Plushbeds and this Adjustable Foundation has been excellent from beginning to end.

Very nice bed
This is a very nice bed. It has turned my bedroom into a luxurious oasis! I look forward to going to bed every night. I like to run the massage for 20 minutes each night - it helps me fall asleep. I also like to tilt the head of the bed up each morning for my coffee and newspaper before I start my day. It's nice to not have to prop up pillow to do this anymore. I can just press a button and it is instant. I wish I bought this bed sooner.

SCape adjustable bed
We received our SCape in a very short time after ordering. Two men put it all together, including hauling it into the house from a truck, assembly of the two halves, putting on the mattress parts, mattress cover, sheets, etc. in two hours with absolutely NO problems.  Works great.  I think we will very much enjoy this adjustable bed.

Company history[edit]




J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt


In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.


Bedspring vs. Innerspring


At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.


Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.


The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.




The Platt Plow Works


The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.
Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.




Innerspring mattress components


In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett & Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.




J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent


Even greater success followed, and Leggett & Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett & Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company became part of the S&P 500 Index.
Today, Leggett & Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

Company history[edit]




J.P. Leggett






C.B. Platt


In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.


Bedspring vs. Innerspring


At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface.


Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress.


The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.




The Platt Plow Works


The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.
Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.




Innerspring mattress components


In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett & Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program.




J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent


Even greater success followed, and Leggett & Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett & Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company became part of the S&P 500 Index.
Today, Leggett & Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        HPFY Stores has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 10 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
