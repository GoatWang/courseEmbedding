Home    * 5677 S Redwood Rd #18 * Taylorsville UT 84123 *   HomeAboutContactTestimonials  Cavalier Investments, LLC      We specialize in reuniting people with long lost money that they didn't know they had!  We do all the work - you just wait for your check​     How it Works​​Cavalier Investments audits many different agencies across the country to locate sums of money owed to private individuals and companies. If these funds go unclaimed for too long, they are usually lost to the agency holding them. We would like to connect you with your long lost property and keep it out of the agencies' hands! We do the research and collect all of the necessary documents that are needed for you to collect your property. All you do is sit back, relax and wait for your check.​    ​Contact Us​If you have received a message from us concerning some property that we have located for you, please call us at 801.572.6100 and press option #1If you need more information, please press option #3. We are happy to review the process and answer all of your questions. ​We value our privacy and don't like getting hassled by solicitor phone calls or junk mail, so we won't send you unwanted updates unless you ask us. We don't give out our client information to anyone either.We look forward to hearing from you!  ​Check out what some people have said: “Hey, Thanks for getting us the money - we didn’t even know we had. We were skeptical at first, but cavalierinvestments.org came through and the money helped us during the slow winter months." Terry Dipoma - (HVAC - Heating & Air) “You helped us get money fast, we thought it would take months, and you had us a check in a week!!!  Thanks - Farrell Newland of Newland Construction - (Contractor) Testimonials  ​We've all heard that if it sounds too good to be true . . . it probably is.  Well, rest assured, We are NOT one of "those" things, and if you give us the opportunity, we'll prove it to you! Give us a call and let us show you what our research has uncovered. You won't believe it until you see it. Cavalier Investments audits government agencies throughout the country, digging through their public records in search of lost, missing, and unclaimed funds belonging to private citizens. Now, be careful, because these funds are held for only a brief period of time, after which the agency responsible for them may be permitted to seize them through a process called "escheatment." We think private citizens losing their funds to faceless government agencies (a system rooted in feudal 16th century England) is completely unfair and we are determined to prevent this from happening to anyone, especially you.

Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Puppies


Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Puppies
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Puppies




                Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are the quintessential lap dog: sweet, gentle and affectionate. These dogs gained their popularity as a pet to royalty in the United Kingdom in the 1500's, and are today among the most popular breeds by the AKC. Their dark, expressive eyes are characteristic of the breed, just as their calm and loving nature. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are known for being wonderful with children and making excellent family pets. Because they are so eager to please, training is generally easy for these dogs. They will weigh between 13-18 lbs. on average when fully grown. Learn more about Cavalier King Charles Spaniel >

About PuppySpot.com

				PuppySpot is a service committed to helping responsible breeders
				place their puppies with caring individuals and families in New York City,
				Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Dallas, and across the U.S.
				But, more than just a service, PuppySpot is a community of dog
				lovers whose mission is to make lives better by placing healthy
				puppies into happy homes. The PuppySpot brand, with
				puppies at the center, is rooted in the belief that dogs should
				be celebrated, and owners deserve to experience trust, confidence
				and transparency when searching for their new companions.
			

				With a screened and vetted network of responsible breeders, PuppySpot makes
				fetching your new best friend a simple and enjoyable experience. PuppySpot
				uses a personalized approach that caters to the needs of those in search of
				a new furry friend as well as the breeders who are looking for their puppies'
				forever homes. Each breeder within the PuppySpot community is held to the highest
				standards, with health and safety for all dogs (not just puppies) as top priorities.
				Following a comprehensive, proprietary screening process, less than 10 percent of
				breeders who begin the PuppySpot review process are invited to join the exclusive
				community — ensuring that both two- and four-legged friends receive a premium experience
				that is seamless and quality-driven.

		Spark Networks (parent company to JDate and ChristianMingle), Greg is an experienced builder of 
		authentic brands and an accomplished digital executive. Greg holds a BA from Stanford University,
