Discovery Group





















 























 








	Micro-capitalization public companies are ignored by large, institutional investors. As a result, micro-cap stocks trade well below their inherent economic value. Discovery Group identifies small public companies with strong operating fundamentals and invests in those that are likely to experience significant improvement in valuation based on specific anticipated business developments.


	The Principals at Discovery Group have extensive experience in corporate investment banking and strategic business development. Over time, Discovery's highly specialized investment approach has proven to generate attractive investment returns that are uniquely differentiated from other public and private equity strategies.

Investment Criteria - Discovery Group's Strategy




















 























 






Universe of Micro-Capitalization Public Companies
Investment Criteria
Active Portfolio Management






		INVESTMENT CRITERIA


		There are many quantitative and qualitative measures that we use to select the appropriate companies for our portfolio. First and foremost, we do not get involved in turnaround situations. So, we screen for companies with a unique competitive position, solid operating performance, good management teams, and governance practices that are aligned with shareholders' interests. Essentially, the only thing that is "broken" is the stock market's appreciation of the value of the business.
	

		Over the course of many years of experience, we have honed proprietary screening techniques. Once we have identified a candidate for further evaluation, we do our own research and analysis. Our financial models drive a disciplined approach to ranking the various opportunities we uncover.
	




Strategic Competitive Position


Strong Revenue Growth


High Margins and Cash Flow


Solid Financial Position


Low Market Valuation

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
