Deirdre P. Connelly Joins Macy's, Inc. Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Deirdre P. Connelly Joins Macy’s, Inc. 
      Board of Directors






December 12, 2007 03:53 PM Eastern Standard Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) today announced that 
      Deirdre P. Connelly, president of U.S. operations at Eli Lilly and 
      Company, has been elected to the company’s 
      board of directors, effective Jan. 1, 2008.
    


“Deirdre Connelly is an accomplished business 
      executive with deep insight into building strong organizations and 
      marketing to defined customer segments,” said 
      Terry J. Lundgren, Macy’s, Inc. chairman, 
      president and chief executive officer. “She 
      will be a valuable resource as we intensify our focus on Hispanic 
      customers, as well as execute our strategy for tailoring merchandise 
      assortments to the local customer at each Macy’s 
      store.
    

“We continue to be proud of the inclusiveness 
      of our board of directors and management team, which reflect the 
      diversity of our customers and workforce,” 
      Lundgren said. Connelly becomes the fourth woman currently serving on 
      the 11-member Macy’s, Inc. board, joining 
      Sara Levinson, Joyce M. Roche and Marna C. Whittington.
    

      Connelly, 47, was named president of Lilly USA in June 2005. Before 
      assuming that role, she was senior vice president for human resources 
      for Lilly. She joined the company’s policy 
      committee in October 2004. She had been vice president of human 
      resources for pharmaceutical operations since May 2004.
    

      Connelly joined Lilly in 1983 as a sales representative and moved to San 
      Juan as a marketing associate a year later. In 1989, Connelly joined the 
      international management development program at Lilly Corporate Center 
      in Indianapolis and later became a sales supervisor in Philadelphia. In 
      1990, she returned to San Juan as a diabetes product manager. In 1991, 
      Connelly was named national sales manager for the Puerto Rico affiliate 
      and, in 1992, she was named marketing and sales director for Puerto 
      Rico. In 1993, she became director of sales and marketing for the 
      Caribbean Basin Region, including Central America, Puerto Rico, and 
      Caribbean Island countries. She was promoted to general manager for Eli 
      Lilly Puerto Rico, S.A., in 1995.
    

      Connelly returned to Indianapolis in 1997. From 1997 to 2001, she held 
      the positions of regional sales director, executive director of global 
      marketing for Evista®, and team leader for 
      the Evista® product team and was promoted to 
      leader of the woman’s health business unit in 
      the U.S. affiliate. In 2003, she became executive director of human 
      resources for the U.S. affiliate.
    

      A native of San Juan, Connelly received a bachelor's degree in economics 
      and marketing from Lycoming College in Pennsylvania in 1983. She 
      graduated from the Harvard University's Advanced Management Program in 
      2000. In 2006 and again in 2007, Connelly was recognized by Fortune 
      magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in business.
    

      Macy's, Inc., with corporate offices in Cincinnati and New York , is one 
      of the nation's premier retailers, with fiscal 2006 sales of $27
