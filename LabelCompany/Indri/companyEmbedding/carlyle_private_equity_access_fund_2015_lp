Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

Our Business







Carlyle’s Global Alternative Asset Management Platform
We are one of the world’s largest and most diversified alternative asset management firms. We manage 287 investment vehicles that invest across four segments, 11 core industries and six continents. Our global size, scale and brand enable us to access opportunities in virtually every market around the world.





 
















Carlyle's Business Segments







 

Corporate Private Equity
Corporate Private Equity
Carlyle’s Corporate Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with our first U.S. buyout fund, has Assets Under Management of $53 billion and more than 275 investment professionals. Our 30 Corporate Private Equity funds are organized by geography or industry and are advised by separate teams of professionals who live and work in the markets where they invest. We believe this diversity of funds allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the ability to better tailor their investment choices. Our Corporate Private Equity teams have two primary areas of focus:
Buyout Funds. Our buyout teams advise a diverse group of 20 funds that focus either on a particular geography (Asia, Europe, Japan, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South America, Sub-Saharan Africa or the United States), or a particular industry (e.g., financial services).
Growth Capital Funds. Our 10 growth capital funds are advised by three regionally-focused teams in Asia, Europe and the United States, with each team focused on middle-market and growth companies consistent with specific regional investment considerations. As of March 31, 2017, our growth capital funds had, in the aggregate, more than $6 billion in AUM.

The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation. As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

On September 11, 2001, the Group happened to be hosting a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guest of honor: investor Shafig bin Laden, another brother to Osama.

The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation. As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering.

In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]

Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments.

According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]

Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]
Since 2007[edit]




David Rubenstein, the head of the Carlyle Group, the largest private equity firm (by investor commitments) during the 2006–07 buyout boom.[43]


On January 28, 2007, the Carlyle group purchased Synagro Technologies, a municipal sludge hauler and spreader, for $5.76 per share.[44]
Carlyle continued to make large investments into 2007 as the buyout market reached its peak.

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Note: segments may not add to total due to rounding.
Total AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise. Fee-Earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Fundraising excludes acquisitions; funds denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars have been converted at the spot rate as of the date of closing of such commitment. Invested Capital represents carry fund transactions only (including related coinvestments); for purposes of aggregation, transactions denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars have been converted at the average rate for the period presented. Invested Capital does not include hedge funds, mutual funds, structured credit funds, and NGP management fee funds. Realized Proceeds are presented for years 2011 to present; years before 2011 are presented using Distributions to fund investors. Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents unrealized gain/(loss) for the period on a total return basis before fees and expenses; fund only, does not include coinvestment; the percentage of return is calculated as: ending remaining investment fair market value plus net investment outflow (sales proceeds minus net purchases) minus beginning remaining investment fair market value divided by beginning remaining investment fair market value. As of 12/31/2016, investment funds and vehicles advised by AlpInvest Partners B.V. and Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC, which comprise our Investment Solutions segment, are included in our ""carry funds"" definition. Accordingly, they are included in our Invested Capital, Realized Proceeds and Fund Appreciation metrics.
For detailed definitions of the operating metrics above, please see The Carlyle Group LP's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

About Us









Preqin Solutions, formerly Baxon Solutions, is the leading innovator of cloud solutions to the Private Equity industry. We believe that the Private Equity industry deserves better software to help it manage data, and our firm aims to deliver simple functionality to enhance the quality of data and decision making tools available to portfolio companies through to the asset owners. Central to this objective, is the belief that these tools should be accessible to all market participants, and we aim to accommodate all firm sizes through a scalable pricing model and a lightweight solution that doesn’t require significant client resource to manage.
Established in 2005, we have built an extensive in-house team of experienced consultants and financial analysts and accumulated a wealth of client and implementation best practices from our global customer base. We provide a consultative approach to fully assess your business challenges to configure our solution to your needs.

Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation. As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

The extremely influential Carlyle Group has arranged similar gatherings during the previous fourteen years, beneath the radar of most of the mass media, between former politicians like Bush, James Baker, John Major, former World Bank treasurer Afsaneh Masheyekhi, and interested parties looking for some extremely expensive, high-powered lobbying services. On September 11, 2001, the Group happened to be hosting a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guest of honor: investor Shafig bin Laden, another brother to Osama.

The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation. As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]

Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
