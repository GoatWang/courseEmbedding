Additional Information


Product Details

Leveraging more than 25 years of research, Elizabeth Arden has updated the existing Ceramide Eye Capsule formula, adding 9 new ingredients to not only replenish essential, naturally-occurring lipids, but also help support skin’s natural renewal process and target the key signs of aging around the eyes for a younger and brighter look. The result is a serum that immediately enhances skin’s natural barrier, increases moisturization within the surface of the skin, and minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Did you know?
The eye contour has the thinnest, most fragile skin on the entire face*. Advanced Ceramide Eye Capsules are formulated specifically for the delicate skin around the eye and to target visible imperfections such as crow’s feet, crepiness and puffiness.
Precise. Potent. Targeted for Eyes.
Each golden capsule is biodegradable, fragrance and preservative-free—designed to deliver a fresh, concentrated dose of moisture-boosting serum packed with even more advanced Ceramide technology than before.

Clinically tested to improve the look of2:
Crow’s feet, fine lines and wrinkles
Firmness and elasticity
Skin texture and clarity
Puffiness 
Undereye discolorations

About ELIZABETH ARDEN, INC.

   Sweet scents and more are behind Elizabeth Arden's auspicious red door. The firm owns and licenses prestige and mass market celebrity, lifestyle, and designer fragrances and distributes about 280 prestige fragrance brands. Fragrance generated some 77% of 2014 sales. Established labels include Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue, and Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds. Scents aimed at younger wearers include the Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj licensed brands. Its fragrances, cosmetics, and skin care lines (Ceramide, PREVAGE, Visible Difference) are sold to US department stores and mass retailers, as well as international retailers. In 2016 cosmetics giant Revlon Inc. acquired Elizabeth Arden for more than $419 million in cash.
   Change in Company Type

   Following Revlon's acquisition, the company ceased operating as a public company after delisting its common stock from NASDAQ.
  
Operations
 Cosmetic Essence makes Elizabeth Arden products and a separate company runs its Red Door salons.
  

   Elizabeth Arden divides its business between North America and International activities.
  

   Contributing 57% of 2014 revenue, the North America segment sells Elizabeth Arden's lineup to department stores, mass retailers, and distributors in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. It includes Elizabeth Arden namesake retail outlets and e-tail business, and some 50 Red Door beauty salons operated by privately-held Red Door Spa Holdings. As part of its agreement with the salons, Elizabeth Arden charges the salons a licensing fee based on sales of its namesake products and for use of its Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks.
  

   The International segment drives the sale of owned and licensed brands beyond North America to perfumeries, boutiques, department stores, travel retail outlets, and distributors.
  
Geographic Reach

   Elizabeth Arden products are sold in more than 120 countries through 50,000-plus retail locations worldwide. About 45% of the company's sales come from foreign markets, led by the UK, which has shrunk over the last few years, followed by growth in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The beauty company sells its fragrances, cosmetics, and skin care through a variety of retailers. It relies on retailers and specialty stores the likes of Macy's, Dillard's, Ulta, Belk, Sephora, Bloomingdale's, and Nordstrom. Mass retailers include Wal-Mart, Target, Kohl's, Walgreens, CVS, and Marmaxx in the US and internationally in Boots, Debenhams, Superdrug Stores, The Perfume Shop, Hudson's Bay, Shoppers Drug Mart, Myer, and Douglas. Travel retail outlets, such as Nuance, Heinemann, and World Duty Free, also carry Elizabeth Arden products. Elizabeth Arden also boasts namesake retail outlets and an e-commerce site.
  

   Elizabeth Arden devoted fewer dollars to advertising expenses in 2014, logging $367.8 million that year, down from $414.1 million in 2013 and $353.1 million in 2012.
  
Financial Performance

   Elizabeth Arden logged $1.16 billion in revenue in fiscal 2014 (ended June), representing a 13% decline from $1.34 billion in 2013. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency -- together with $9.5 million in returns and markdowns recorded as a result of the company's 2014 Performance Improvement Plan and Pricing Changes -- also dragged down revenue results. The company, however, reported a $145.7 million loss in 2014, attributable to a 13% drop in sales. In 2014, Elizabeth Arden posted $38 million in net cash used in operating activities, down more than $100 million from 2013's cash flow of $62 million.
  
Strategy

   Having become a centenarian in 2009, older and wiser Elizabeth Arden has shifted its focus to serving the younger and determined-to-stay-young consumer on a global basis. To this end, the beauty company regularly introduces new products in each of the skin care, fragrance, and color categories that strengthen its association with leading celebrity and designer names, as well as anti-aging lifestyle trends.
  

   The company's also working to penetrate international markets, particularly in the large European fragrance sector, with its prestige fragrance portfolio. Additionally, it aims to grow in markets such as Brazil and the Middle East.
  

   The company acquired the global licenses and certain related assets for Justin Bieber's
   
    Someday
   
   and
   
    Girlfriend
   
   perfume labels in 2012 and Nicki Minaj's fall fragrance from Give Back Brands. Elizabeth Arden already holds an exclusive global fragrance agreement with country pop singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Elizabeth Arden also purchased the licenses and related assets for the Ed Hardy, True Religion, and BCBGMAXAZRIA fragrance brands from New Wave Fragrances (for $60 million), and has launched a stream of other celeb and designer fragrances, including scents sold under the Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Kate Spade, and John Varvatos brands.
  

   It's developing and marketing fragrance products for indie vintage-inspired women's knitwear designer brand Wildfox Couture based on an agreement it entered in 2014. Elizabeth Arden also inked a long-term licensing agreement in 2011 with women's apparel maker Liz Claiborne. The deal gives Elizabeth Arden the right to acquire the trademark to Liz Claiborne's
   
    Curve
   
   and

   names and builds upon Elizabeth Arden's successful pact to make and market Liz Claiborne fragrances under name brands

    Lucky Brand
   
   ,
   
    Liz
   
   , and

   .
  

   To boost its namesake spa business to keep pace with growth of its namesake brand, Elizabeth Arden invested $9.7 million from 2013 to 2014 in Elizabeth Arden Spa Holdings, LLC, which operates subsidiaries Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spas and the Mario Tricoci Hair Salons.

Elizabeth Arden underlines commitment to travel retail with exclusive products

22 February 2017












































Elizabeth Arden is set to launch a number of travel retail-exclusive products at the upcoming IAADFS Duty Free Show of the Americas (booth 623) to underline its commitment to the channel.
For the first time in decades, the brand has upgraded its popular Ceramide Youth Restoring Face Serum. The new Advanced Ceramide Capsule Daily Youth Restoring Serum is said to provide a youth-restoring boost as well as helping to moisturise, preserve and strengthen skin’s integrity for a firmer look.
The product is offered in a “first-of-its-kind” single dose capsule and will be available exclusively to travellers in the new Advanced Ceramide Capsules Replenish & Restore for Face skincare set. The set will comprise the existing 3 x 30 capsule design but will be enhanced with the new and improved formula and updated packaging, the brand said.
Shelf stand-out: The brand says the new packaging and products will provide a “clear statement and attractive pull strategy”
The Advanced Ceramide Youth Restoring Serum face capsules will also feature in a 30 Capsule tower and the Advanced Restorative Skincare Solutions three piece skincare set, both exclusive to travel retail.
In autumn 2017, Elizabeth Arden will launch an upgraded Advanced Ceramide Capsules Replenish & Restore for Eyes Trio and Advanced Ceramide Daily Youth Restoring 30 piece Face Serum/ 30 piece Eye Serum duo. The upgraded Advanced Ceramide Daily Youth Restoring Eye Serum will also be introduced then.
Last year, Elizabeth Arden started to reposition its Travel Retail Collection by launching a new look for all sets.
Elizabeth Arden Vice-President International Trade Marketing Mary-Beth Mazzotta commented: “We needed a clear statement and attractive pull strategy to engage travellers in the brand and give them the value offers they are looking for. The travel retail-exclusive set category is the perfect platform to service existing customers and attract new ones, so over the past year we have been very busy transitioning our shelves to the new assortments and packaging.”
Mazzotta added that the introduction of a recognisable travel retail-exclusive insignia and the new packaging design is aimed to help grow brand awareness and affinity amongst global shoppers. “We want travellers to view Elizabeth Arden as ‘the’ skincare brand to buy, as well as recognise our products in the glimpse of an eye.”

Elizabeth Arden reports second quarter
By Administrator  | Monday, 19 January 2009 0:00 
Elizabeth Arden has reported preliminary financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008 and is expecting to report net sales in the range of $365m to $370m.
This range of numbers would represent a decrease of 12.5% to 13.5%, or 9% to 10% – excluding the unfavourable impact of foreign currency, as compared to the prior year second quarter.
The company says that economic conditions in its higher margin travel retail and distributor markets worsened considerably in November and December, which negatively impacted on its international results.
In overall terms, net income for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008, excluding expenses related to the Liz Claiborne license agreement and restructuring expenses, is expected to range between $0.57 to $0.61 per diluted share, or $0.72 to $0.76 per diluted share, excluding the estimated unfavourable impact of foreign currency of approximately $0.15 per diluted share. 
This compares to prior guidance of $1.00 to $1.10 per diluted share, excluding an unfavourable impact of foreign currency of $0.11 per diluted share.
E. Scott Beattie, Chairman, President and CEO of Elizabeth Arden, Inc., commented: ‘The consumer and retail environment worldwide was more challenging than we expected when we provided guidance in our first quarter earnings release the first week of November. The performance of our U.S. Elizabeth Arden prestige department store business was much weaker than we had anticipated, though consistent with overall trends experienced in this channel. 
‘Additionally, economic conditions in our higher margin travel retail and distributor markets worsened considerably in November and December, which negatively impacted our international results.
‘Our North America fragrance business fared relatively better, but shipments also were below what we had expected when we provided our guidance. While retail sales were generally consistent with our outlook for the holiday season for North American mass retailers, replenishment orders for this channel were below our expectations. 
‘Results also were impacted by our actions to limit credit risk by decreasing shipments to certain customers due to credit constraints at those customers. Despite the weak environment, we maintained operating profit and improved margins for our North America fragrance business as a whole for the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the prior year.’
Beattie continued, ‘While conditions remain extremely challenging, the strength of our multi-channel business model and brand portfolio led to increased market share in the North American fragrance market this quarter. We improved our already strong competitive position in the mass retail fragrance market, and with the addition of the Liz Claiborne brands in June, doubled our market share in the U.S. department store fragrance market. 
‘Notwithstanding the environment, we continued to invest in our key brands and have seen strong results in relative terms. The recently launched Viva la Juicy fragrance was this fall season's number one fragrance launch at U.S. prestige department stores at the fragrance counter, and the White Diamonds and Curve fragrances were once again the number one selling women's and men's prestige fragrances, respectively, at mass retailers.’
Beattie concluded: ‘Our priorities for the remainder of this fiscal year are to (i) reduce inventory in order to maximize cash flow; (ii) focus our advertising and promotional expenditures on the brands, markets and channels of distribution that provide the best return and eliminate marginal spending; (iii) re-assess new product innovation in light of the current environment and; (iv) accelerate the cost savings and business process re-engineering initiatives related to our Global Efficiency Re-engineering project in order to position our business for improved profitability in fiscal 2010.’

Additional Information


Product Details

Leveraging more than 25 years of research, Elizabeth Arden has updated the existing Ceramide Eye Capsule formula, adding 9 new ingredients to not only replenish essential, naturally-occurring lipids, but also help support skin’s natural renewal process and target the key signs of aging around the eyes for a younger and brighter look. The result is a serum that immediately enhances skin’s natural barrier, increases moisturization within the surface of the skin, and minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Did you know?
The eye contour has the thinnest, most fragile skin on the entire face*. Advanced Ceramide Eye Capsules are formulated specifically for the delicate skin around the eye and to target visible imperfections such as crow’s feet, crepiness and puffiness.
Precise. Potent. Targeted for Eyes.
Each golden capsule is biodegradable, fragrance and preservative-free—designed to deliver a fresh, concentrated dose of moisture-boosting serum packed with even more advanced Ceramide technology than before.

Clinically tested to improve the look of2:
Crow’s feet, fine lines and wrinkles
Firmness and elasticity
Skin texture and clarity
Puffiness 
Undereye discolorations

What People Are Saying About FragranceX.com








I checked two online websites to compare value and found FragranceX was the best. I have used this website previously so felt very comfortable when placing my order.








Terri V
Milford, MI, USA





I just love Fragrancex and have been purchasing from this online store for a number of years now. I have recommended the site to many people and they too are always extremely happy with their purchase. I even buy my son's aftershaves through Fragrancex!! I always get free delivery and as a loyal customer I also get an extra 10% discount of my purchases...... Yay!!!!








Susan K
Caulfield, Australia














I order always on fragrance X because they are the best. The products are cheap but with an excellent quality. I wait only 6 days to have my products into my hands ,however i live in Europe. That's great. I recommend this website! Thanks to fragrance x. 








Florence G
Vedène, France











I was very happy with my order placed with FragranceX.com and would recommend to any friend. I was kept updated on the progress of my items and they arrived well within time. I don't think I could have got much cheaper anywhere else and know and trust this site. Thank you!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
