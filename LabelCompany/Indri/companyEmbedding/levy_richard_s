                           The word "antisemite" was first used to describe a politically motivated enemy of the Jews in 1879. The subject of antisemitism
                              has often been focused on the Holocaust; however, current events and history have much to add to this discussion. For example,
                              in 1995 a Japanese pseudo-Buddhist religious cult, imagining itself to be under attack by Jews, released sarin gas on the
                              Tokyo subway, killing 12. From 1881 to 1900 there were 128 public accusations of Jewish "ritual murder" allegedly involving
                              the killing of Christian children to use their blood for religious purposes. Entries in this encyclopedia span the period
                              from ancient Egypt to the modern era. Key theoreticians of Jew-hatred and their written works, its permeation of Christianity
                              and modern Islam, and its political, artistic, and economic manifestations are covered. This is the first comprehensive work
                              that deals with the entire history of ideas and practices that engendered the Holocaust

                           A strange and repugnant mystery of the twentieth century is the durability of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a clumsy
                              forgery purporting to be evidence of the supposed Jewish plot to rule the world. Though it has been exposed as a forgery,
                              some apprentice brownshirt is always rediscovering it, the latest in a line of gullibility that includes, most famously, Henry
                              Ford. Recently it has been translated into Japanese and circulates once again with renewed virulence in the former Soviet
                              Union and Eastern Europe. In 1924 in Germany the Jewish author and journalist Binjamin Segel wrote a major historical expose
                              of the fraud and later edited his work into a shorter form, published as Welt-Krieg, Welt-Revolution, Welt-Verschworung, Welt-Oberregierung
                              (Berlin 1926). Translator Richard S. Levy, a specialist on the history of antisemitism, provides an extensive introduction
                              on the circumstances of Segel's work and the story of the Protocols up to the 1990s, including an explanation of its continuing
                              psychological appeal and political function

                           This work offers an overview of a the topic, describing and analyzing the hatred that Jews have faced from ancient times to
                              the present. The essays contained in this volume provide an introduction to the history and nature of antisemitism, stressing
                              readability, balance, and thematic coherence, while trying to gain some distance from the polemics and apologetics that so
                              often cloud the subject. Chapters have been written by leading scholars in the field and take into account the most important
                              new developments in their areas of expertise. Collectively, the chapters cover the whole history of antisemitism, from the
                              ancient Mediterranean and the pre-Christian era, through the Medieval and Early Modern periods, to the Enlightenment and beyond.
                              The later chapters focus on the history of antisemitism by region, looking at France, the English-speaking world, Russia and
                              the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Nazi Germany, with contributions too on the phenomenon in the Arab world, both before
                              and after the foundation of Israel. Contributors grapple with the use and abuse of the term 'antisemitism', which was first
                              coined in the mid-nineteenth century but which has since gathered a range of obscure connotations and confusingly different
                              definitions, often applied retrospectively to historically distant periods and vastly dissimilar phenomena. Of course, as
                              this book shows, hostility to Jews dates to biblical periods, but the nature of that hostility and the many purposes to which
                              it has been put have varied over time and often been mixed with admiration, a situation which continues in the twenty-first
                              century

                              Inventory and evaluation of architectural and engineering resources was conducted in the 123,000-acre Big South Fork National
                                 River and Recreation Area (BSFNRRA) in the Cumberland Plateau region of southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee.
                                 Objectives of the research were to: (1) determine the significance and (2) make recommendations regarding the long-term management
                                 of the important architectural and engineering resources (i.e., those considered potentially eligible for the National Register
                                 of Historic Places). Nineteen buildings were identified as being potentially eligible for the National Register, including
                                 historic farmsteads, a hunting lodge (Parch Corn Lodge), and various buildings which are of importance for interpretative
                                 use. The significant engineering resources of the National Area consist of one Whipple truss bridge, one plate-girder bridge,
                                 one ballast-filled concrete arch bridge, and the Blue Heron coal tipple/tramway. Two other bridges may prove to be significant
                                 to the ongoing bridge preservation plan of the State of Tennessee. General recommendations for the preservation, maintenance,
                                 or restoration of the buildings, bridges, and coal tipple/tramway have been made. During the course of this study (although
                                 not originally intended as part of the study), a total of 230 archaeological sites was discovered. These discoveries, in conjunction
                                 with other known sites, brings the total of known archaeological sites within the BSFNRRA to 457. (Author)

	Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution - ABC-CLIO













































ABC-CLIO












Antisemitism
A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution

 
Antisemitism has informed the theory and practice of politics and has permeated cultures around the world. The line between anti-Jewish sentiment and other kinds of conflict is hard to define, but it is clear that the destructive nature of antisemitism has harmed the human community for two millennia.

Written by top scholars in an accessible manner, this unique encyclopedia offers worldwide coverage of the origins, forms, practitioners, and effects of antisemitism, leading to the Holocaust and surviving to the present day.
The word "antisemite" was first used to describe a politically motivated enemy of the Jews in 1879. The subject of antisemitism has often been focused on the Holocaust; however, current events and history have much to add to this discussion. For example, in 1995 a Japanese pseudo-Buddhist religious cult, imagining itself to be under attack by Jews, released sarin gas on the Tokyo subway, killing 12. From 1881 to 1900 there were 128 public accusations of Jewish "ritual murder" allegedly involving the killing of Christian children to use their blood for religious purposes.Entries in this encyclopedia span the period from ancient Egypt to the modern era. Key theoreticians of Jew-hatred and their written works, its permeation of Christianity and modern Islam, and its political, artistic, and economic manifestations are covered. This is the first comprehensive work that deals with the entire history of ideas and practices that engendered the Holocaust.
Features
650 A–Z entries by over 200 scholars from 21 countriesIllustrations such as caricatures, political cartoons, maps, and pictures of famous antisemites and historical episodesCitations of recent literature that follow each entryDetailed index listing people, places, concepts, and events that enables users to find information about subjects not treated in dedicated articlesDirection at the end of each entry to other articles with special relevance to the topic
Highlights
The only encyclopedia that brings current expertise to bear on over two millennia of anti-Jewish hostilityWorldwide coverage of antisemitism that treats an emotionally charged subject with objectivitySpecial attention to the role of antisemitism in Christianity and Islam






Author Info

Richard S. Levy, PhD, is associate professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL. He is the author of  The Downfall of the Anti-Semitic Political Parties in Imperial Germany and editor of Antisemitism in the Modern World: An Anthology of Texts.

Reviews/Endorsements
Reviews"This encyclopedia is groundbreaking, its most notable merits being the presentation of accurate and up-to-date information in an unbiased manner.
