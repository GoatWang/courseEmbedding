Diversity


















 
                    The Advisory Board Company
                 

















Why a diverse, inclusive workplace matters to us






 
We’re focused on creating an inclusive, dynamic, and diverse work environment. We value and celebrate different perspectives not only to create a vibrant workplace for our existing staff but also to attract the mission-driven, talented individuals who will make the Advisory Board even stronger. 
Our vision for diversity and inclusion
Research has shown that a diverse, inclusive workforce is more productive and innovative. It has also revealed that without intentional and explicit actions, traditionally underrepresented groups remain disadvantaged in the corporate world.
 
That’s why we’re striving for a workplace that:

Values differences in opinion and embraces everyone’s unique perspective
Allows employees to bring their full selves to work each day 
Proactively guards against unconscious biases 
Is full of empathy, respect, and inclusivity with respect to our colleagues, members, and community 
Has a strong firm culture but also continually grows and adapts

At the highest level, these principles shape the Advisory Board's culture. Our core values have always been essential to our success, especially our commitment to service and our spirit of generosity.
Our employees align with this culture and contribute to it. We welcome and encourage new insights—fresh ideas that spark meaningful improvements. As a result, our culture evolves continuously to reflect the diversity of thought, experience, and identity our employees represent.
How we nurture our people
The Advisory Board invests in programs that recruit, retain, and support our diverse staff so we can nurture high-potential talent of various backgrounds and experiences. We seek to promote and support diversity through programs such as: 

  
People of Color Affinity Group
A resource group that provides personal and professional support for people of color, and serves as a forum to share feedback and ideas with senior leadership on how to enhance the experience of people of color at the firm.
Minority Mentorship Program
A program connecting individuals in the People of Color Affinity Group with mentors in senior leadership to provide career guidance and sponsorship support.
Women in Leadership
WiL was created to ensure that the Advisory Board continues to be a compelling, competitive, and sustainable place for smart, career-minded women to stay, thrive, and advance in leadership. WiL provides proven women leaders special opportunities for enhanced visibility, learning, coaching, networking, and career planning.

Women in Technology
A staff-led initiative focused on supporting the professional growth and networking of women in technology-related roles across our product, delivery, and commercial divisions.
Veterans Cause Community and “Still Serving” program
A group of veterans and supporters focused on providing volunteer service to wounded active duty service members and veterans. 
LGBTQ Affinity Group
A group of LGBTQ staff and allies focused on affirming a culture supportive of unique LGBTQ issues and committed to fostering workplace equality for our employees and the broader LGBTQ community. 
Diversity Ambassador Program
A program supporting current staff to recruit employees with diverse backgrounds. 

The Advisory Board Company aims to continually evolve our diversity and inclusion programs and goals. Discussions around sensitive topics such as race, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health, and societal structural inequality are difficult ones, but we pledge to address these challenges head-on to ensure that all employees can bring their full selves to work and feel that their unique contribution to the firm's mission and culture is valued.

Our history


















 
                    The Advisory Board Company
                 

















Our history
It all started with a single Washington, D.C., apartment...






 
 
Founded in 1979 by David Bradley with only five employees, The Advisory Board Company has grown into a global firm employing more than 3,600 people in offices on three continents.
And while our inherent values haven't changed, the Advisory Board's impact on health care and education has grown exponentially.


Take a look back at our dramatic growth





1979

David Bradley founded the company in Washington, D.C., as the Research Counsel of Washington with five employees. Mission: to answer "any question for any company for any industry."
After initially operating out of David Bradley's mother's Watergate building condominium, the firm moves to a townhouse on Capitol Hill. The very first logo for the company is inspired by that townhouse.




1983-86

1983
The firm begins to specialize in financial services research and changes its name to The Advisory Board Company.
1986
The firm creates a health care focused strategic research division and launches its first membership, the Health Care Advisory Board.




1990

1990
With more than 500 health care members and 150 employees, the Advisory Board publishes 15 major reports and 200 research briefs yearly.
David Bradley commissions a new logo that takes inspiration from Thomas Jefferson...the force of his ideas, the power of his intellect, and the passion he displayed for innovation. The logo is an interpretation of the Jefferson Memorial, overlaid with Thomas Jefferson's initials and surrounded by the firm's name. The pillars represented in the logo inspire the firm's mission and values.




1993-97

1993
The firm launches a strategic research membership for large companies, bringing on almost half of the Fortune 500 within 18 months.
1994
The firm creates its first clinically based program, the Cardiology Roundtable (which has since evolved to become the Cardiovascular Roundtable), providing best practices for cardiac programs.
1997
The firm spins off its corporate membership group, the Corporate Executive Board, as an independent company. The Advisory Board focuses on health care, serving 1,500+ organizations.
In addition, it launches H*Works, a consulting business offering best practices implementation support—the start of our Consulting services.




2001-03

2001
The Advisory Board Company completes an initial public offering.
2002
The firm tops 2,100 memberships and 500 employees.

Seeking to address health care's leadership gap, the firm launches Advisory Board Academies.
2003
The Advisory Board Company is named to Washingtonian magazine's "Great Places to Work."
The firm launches Compass, providing memberships anchored by business intelligence and analytics tools.




2005-08

2005
The firm is named to Forbes' "Top 200 High-Growth Companies" list and is again honored as one of Washingtonian's "Great Places to Work."
See how the Advisory Board continues to be recognized.
2007
Extending its reach to serve student and academic affairs executives at U.S. research universities, the firm launches its first higher education membership programs.
2008
The firm acquires Crimson, a data, analytics, and business intelligence software provider focused on physician performance, quality metrics, and cost-of-care outcomes.




2009-10

2009
The firm acquires Southwind, expanding its physician management capabilities.
2010

The Advisory Board collaborates with HIMSS Analytics on business-oriented IT research (now our Health Care IT Advisor) and acquires Concuity, provider of revenue management software and services, which powers our Payment Integrity Compass initiative.
The Advisory Board is named Modern Healthcare's "Best Places to Work."
In addition, the firm opens a San Francisco office and has a presence in Washington, D.C.; Austin; Chicago; Nashville; Chennai; and London. Learn more about our locations.




2011-12

2011
The firm partners with Milliman MedInsight to offer population-risk analytics. It also acquires Cielo MedSolutions, a provider of ambulatory patient registry software, and PivotHealth, a leading physician practice management firm. Advisory Board performance technologies now account for one in three U.S. inpatient admissions.
The Advisory Board adopts a new logo. It reflects the firm's dramatic transformation to a provider of technology solutions, consulting, and management services while maintaining a connection to the firm's Jeffersonian legacy.
The logo is an abstract version of a revolving bookstand, likely a Jefferson design from 1810. In addition to signaling our continued evolution and commitment to thought leadership and innovation, the new logo design suggests the letter A.
2012
The Advisory board acquires ActiveStrategy, a performance improvement technology firm, and 360Fresh, a leading provider of clinical data analytics.
The firm is named to Healthcare Informatics' top 100 health care IT firms and Modern Healthcare's top 40 fastest-growing health care firms and best places to work list. The Advisory Board provides $1M in benefit to non-profit organizations through its Community Impact program.




2013

2013
The firm is named the “#1 Best Large Company to Work For” by Modern Healthcare magazine. In addition, the Advisory Board acquires Care Team Connect, a care management workflow platform that has helped coordinate care for over 2 million patients nationwide.
The firm launches the Student Success Collaborative, a software-based program that helps colleges and universities improve outcomes for at-risk and off-path students.
With 2,800 employees across 11 global offices, the firm serves 200,000 leaders in health care and higher education. It is the first for-profit company of its size to achieve 100% participation in community service. (The U.S. corporate average: 30%.)




2014-15

2014
2014 brought the acquisitions of HealthPost, which helps health systems reduce referral leakage and attract new patients, and Royall & Company, which provides the higher education industry with data-driven student engagement and enrollment management solutions.
The firm's Community Impact program, meanwhile, received the 2014 Corporate Engagement Award of Excellence from Points of Light. The firm also partnered with the de Beaumont Foundation, Kresge Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to launch the BUILD Health Challenge to identify and support health partnerships that improve health in low-income, urban communities.
2015
As of 2015, the firm had grown to more than 2,800 employees, with 12 offices on three continents and more than 5,000 member organizations in the health care and higher education fields. It also announced the acquisition of Clinovations, an EMR optimization firm serving providers at the intersection of clinician workflows and information technology, and GradesFirst, a student success technology company with workflow software that enables colleges and universities to identify, engage, and support at-risk students.

Robert Musslewhite serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company. Robert joined the firm in 2003, guiding growth strategy and the firm’s technology portfolio before becoming CEO in 2008. 
Under Robert’s leadership as CEO, The Advisory Board Company has more than quadrupled in size and now serves nearly 300,000 leaders in over 5,500 hospitals, health systems, and universities worldwide. He has continued to guide the firm’s strategy, keeping our comprehensive research portfolio at the core while expanding our technology, consulting, and data-enabled services capabilities to help members hardwire best practices into their institutions. In health care, our focus is on three critical areas, ensuring that health systems: attract, retain, and engage patients by offering the care they need; deliver the highest standard of care by instituting and consistently following the best protocols; and receive payment for the services they render, so they have the financial stability to serve their communities for the long term. In Education, we deliver significant value by leveraging our data assets and deep expertise to bolster results across the student life cycle, including recruitment, enrollment, retention, and student success.
The company’s mission, values, and unique culture are a priority for Robert. On his watch, the firm has garnered wide recognition, including Modern Healthcare magazine’s “Best Places to Work” for eight years running; Forbes’ “Best Management Consulting Firm” and “40 Most Innovative Growth Companies”; Working Mother magazine’s “100 Best Places to Work”; the Human Rights Campaign’s “Best Place to Work” for LGBTQ employees; and a two-time finalist for the Software & Information Industry Association CODiE Awards. Robert has also placed immense emphasis on strengthening our communities; the firm has one of the highest rates of employee volunteerism in the nation, with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of service work and donations provided to non-profit organizations across his tenure. 
Robert was named a “Tech Titan” by Washingtonian Magazine three times, honored as one of the "Power 100" in the Washington Business Journal, won the Ernst & Young LLP Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Business Services in Greater Washington, and has been profiled in the New York Times.
Prior to joining The Advisory Board Company, Robert was an Associate Principal with McKinsey & Company in the Washington, D.C., Amsterdam, and Dallas offices. He served a range of clients across the consumer products and other industries and was a co-leader of McKinsey’s Pricing Center. Robert holds a JD from Harvard Law School and an AB in economics from Princeton University. He serves on the Board of Governors of St. Albans School, and is a member of the Washington, DC chapter of Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO). He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and three children.

Learning and development











Orientation
From day one, new hires feel part of the Advisory Board community. Many employees say they make life-long friends their first week at the firm, and it’s no surprise why.


Our business strategy and performance rely on our staff’s knowledge and talents, and this begins with an in-depth onboarding process. 
Staff at all levels of the organization attend Firmwide Orientation together in a new-hire cohort, often representing dozens of departments. Orientation covers firm strategy and culture, product and department overviews, and industry knowledge. 
From there, new employees go through job-specific training to accelerate their learning and assimilation. Ultimately, we want to ensure that staff feel warmly welcomed and receive all the information needed for a strong start.

Ongoing education
This is a culture that values lifelong learning, and Advisory Board University is our platform for those activities. Advisory Board University offers a variety of training opportunities focused on industry knowledge, leadership aptitude, and skill development. From Public Speaking to Management Fundamentals to the Evolution of Health Care, our courses allow staff to participate in classroom-style and webinar-based learning that is relevant to their roles—or simply of interest. We also offer more than 200 self-paced eLearning courses covering business, IT, and desktop application skills.
We also provide ways for staff to share their time, talents, and passions in the community. See how we give back through hands-on service, board service, and pro bono consulting.
Performance management
Merit-based performance management is central to our business. We encourage managers to provide regular informal feedback, and every six months, employees go through a structured review cycle to reflect on past performance and set goals for the future. This includes:


A downward review, in which a manager reviews the staff member’s performance based on a role-specific competency grid with defined quantitative and qualitative expectations.
A self-review, in which the staff member submits input on his or her own work, accomplishments, and contributions.
Upward and peer reviews, in which staff confidentially provide feedback on their managers and colleagues.

Departments are supported by a dedicated and knowledgeable Career Management team. In addition to facilitating reviews, Career Management supports career growth and professional development.
Professional growth
We believe in supporting staff at all stages of their career. Initiatives such as the Associate Development Series for our junior-level staff, skill development courses for managers, and executive coaching and 360-degree assessments for our senior leaders help employees reach their full potential.
Our leadership cohorts serve high-performing staff, including a multi-year program for women in leadership, a staff-led initiative for women in technology, and a nomination-based fellowship for emerging leaders. Additionally, our Learning & Development team facilitates individualized coaching and mentoring relationships.
Communication
We keep staff apprised of firm performance, strategic priorities, and news through a variety of channels. Our firm intranet and weekly newsletter update employees on news and events, department recognition, and service opportunities.

Our annual firmwide meeting is another opportunity for the executive team to educate staff on organizational performance and strategy, share powerful member impact stories, and recognize outstanding staff achievement.

History[edit]
The company was founded by David G. Bradley in 1979 as the Research Council of Washington with five employees. Its original mission was to answer "any question for any company for any industry," but in 1983 the company began to specialize in research for the financial services industry and changed its name to The Advisory Board Company. By 1986, the company had launched its health care-focused strategic research division, including its first membership program, the Health Care Advisory Board.[1]
Across the next four years the firm grew to 150 employees, served more than 500 health care members, and published 15 major reports and 2,000 research briefs each year. In 1993, the firm launched a strategic research membership for large companies, bringing on almost half of the Fortune 500 within 18 months. The firm expanded in 1994 to include its first clinically based program, the Cardiology Roundtable—which has since evolved to become the Cardiovascular Roundtable—providing best practices to the nations’ cardiac programs.
In 1997, the company spun off its corporate membership group, forming The Corporate Executive Board (now CEB Inc.) as an independent company. It maintained its focus on the health care sector, working with more than 1,500 health care organizations. H*Works, a consulting business offering best practice implementation support launched in 2000, followed shortly by The Advisory Board Company’s initial public offering in 2001, in which Bradley sold his ownership interest.
By 2002, the firm topped 2,100 memberships and 500 employees, and launched The Advisory Board Academies leadership development division—now the company's Talent Development division—to address the leadership gap in health care. In 2003, the company was named to Washingtonian’s Great Places to Work and launched its business intelligence and analytics offering, Compass, providing memberships anchored by robust decision support tools. In 2005, the firm was named to Forbes’ Top 200 High-Growth Companies and again to Washingtonian's Great Places to Work.[2]
In 2007, the company launched its first membership programs in higher education, working with student and academic affairs executives at several U.S. research universities.[3] The firm continued to grow across 2008, acquiring Crimson, a data, analytics, and business intelligence software provider focused on physician performance, quality metrics, and cost of care outcomes.
By 2009, The Advisory Board Company had opened its doors in San Francisco, marking the fourth U.S. office. The firm also grew to over 1,000 employees and over 2,800 health care and higher education members. The company expanded its capabilities in the physician management terrain through the acquisition of Southwind, a management and consulting firm focused on aligning hospitals and physicians through a comprehensive set of physician employment, clinical integration, and information technology deployment solutions. During this time,the company was named to Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work—an honor it has received every year since.[4]
From 2010 to 2011, the company continued to expand, acquiring and partnering with a series of technology firms, including Milliman MedInsight, which provides population risk analytics, Cielo MedSolutions, which provides ambulatory patient registry software, and PivotHealth, a physician practice management firm.
In 2012, The Advisory Board Company acquired ActiveStrategy,[5] a performance improvement technology firm, and 360Fresh,[6] a leading provider of clinical data analytics. The firm also was named as one of Healthcare Informatics' top 100 health care IT firms[7] and Modern Healthcare's top 40 fastest-growing health care firms list.[8] During that year, the firm also provided $1 million in benefit to non-profit organizations through its Community Impact program.
In 2013, the firm was named the “#1 Best Large Company to Work For” by Modern Healthcare magazine.[9] It also became the first for-profit company of its size to achieve 100% participation in community service.
That year, the Advisory Board acquired Care Team Connect,[10] a care management workflow platform, and launched the Student Success Collaborative, a software-based program that helps colleges and universities improve outcomes for at-risk and off-path students. The company also announced the acquisition of Medical Referral Source, a technology firm with software that facilitates a seamless referral process.[11]
2014 brought the acquisitions of HealthPost,[12] which helps health systems reduce referral leakage and attract new patients, and Royall & Company, which provides the higher education industry with data-driven student engagement, enrollment management, financial aid optimization, and alumni fundraising solutions.[13]
The company’s Community Impact program, meanwhile, received the 2014 Corporate Engagement Award of Excellence from Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.[14] The firm also partnered with the de Beaumont Foundation, Kresge Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to launch the BUILD Health Challenge to identify and support health partnerships taking bold, upstream, integrated, local, and data-driven approaches to improving health in low-income, urban communities.[15]
In 2015, the company announced its acquisition of Clinovations, an EMR optimization firm serving providers at the intersection of clinician workflows and information technology, and GradesFirst, a student success technology company with workflow software that enables colleges and universities to identify, engage, and support at-risk students.[16]
As of 2016, the company had grown to more than 3,600 employees, with offices on three continents. It was named as a Modern Healthcare Best Place to Work for the eighth straight year.[17]
In January 2017, the company reduced it's healthcare workforce by 220 employees, or 5.7%, exited several businesses and announced a plan to close 4 offices by the end of 2017. [18]
Advisory Board[edit]
The company’s advisory board division serves 4,400+ health care members. Advisory Board forges and finds best practices, then customizes and hardwires those insights for members with research, technology, and consulting. It also publishes American Health Line, a daily health care policy briefing.
Advisory Board Research provides clarity on health care's pressing issues—including strategy, care delivery, and operations—and strategies for addressing them.
Advisory Board Technology services help members find and address opportunities by embedding best practices into operations.
The Advisory Board Consulting team provides hands-on best practice implementation, practice management solutions, and physician alignment services.
EAB[edit]
The company’s EAB division serves 1,100+ college and university members. EAB forges and finds best practices to address education’s top challenges with research forums dedicated to presidents, provosts, chief business officers, and other academic and administrative leaders.[19]

History[edit]
The company was founded by David G. Bradley in 1979 as the Research Council of Washington with five employees. Its original mission was to answer "any question for any company for any industry," but in 1983 the company began to specialize in research for the financial services industry and changed its name to The Advisory Board Company. By 1986, the company had launched its health care-focused strategic research division, including its first membership program, the Health Care Advisory Board.[1]
Across the next four years the firm grew to 150 employees, served more than 500 health care members, and published 15 major reports and 2,000 research briefs each year. In 1993, the firm launched a strategic research membership for large companies, bringing on almost half of the Fortune 500 within 18 months. The firm expanded in 1994 to include its first clinically based program, the Cardiology Roundtable—which has since evolved to become the Cardiovascular Roundtable—providing best practices to the nations’ cardiac programs.
In 1997, the company spun off its corporate membership group, forming The Corporate Executive Board (now CEB Inc.) as an independent company. It maintained its focus on the health care sector, working with more than 1,500 health care organizations. H*Works, a consulting business offering best practice implementation support launched in 2000, followed shortly by The Advisory Board Company’s initial public offering in 2001, in which Bradley sold his ownership interest.
By 2002, the firm topped 2,100 memberships and 500 employees, and launched The Advisory Board Academies leadership development division—now the company's Talent Development division—to address the leadership gap in health care. In 2003, the company was named to Washingtonian’s Great Places to Work and launched its business intelligence and analytics offering, Compass, providing memberships anchored by robust decision support tools. In 2005, the firm was named to Forbes’ Top 200 High-Growth Companies and again to Washingtonian's Great Places to Work.[2]
In 2007, the company launched its first membership programs in higher education, working with student and academic affairs executives at several U.S. research universities.[3] The firm continued to grow across 2008, acquiring Crimson, a data, analytics, and business intelligence software provider focused on physician performance, quality metrics, and cost of care outcomes.
By 2009, The Advisory Board Company had opened its doors in San Francisco, marking the fourth U.S. office. The firm also grew to over 1,000 employees and over 2,800 health care and higher education members. The company expanded its capabilities in the physician management terrain through the acquisition of Southwind, a management and consulting firm focused on aligning hospitals and physicians through a comprehensive set of physician employment, clinical integration, and information technology deployment solutions. During this time,the company was named to Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work—an honor it has received every year since.[4]
From 2010 to 2011, the company continued to expand, acquiring and partnering with a series of technology firms, including Milliman MedInsight, which provides population risk analytics, Cielo MedSolutions, which provides ambulatory patient registry software, and PivotHealth, a physician practice management firm.
In 2012, The Advisory Board Company acquired ActiveStrategy,[5] a performance improvement technology firm, and 360Fresh,[6] a leading provider of clinical data analytics. The firm also was named as one of Healthcare Informatics' top 100 health care IT firms[7] and Modern Healthcare's top 40 fastest-growing health care firms list.[8] During that year, the firm also provided $1 million in benefit to non-profit organizations through its Community Impact program.
In 2013, the firm was named the “#1 Best Large Company to Work For” by Modern Healthcare magazine.[9] It also became the first for-profit company of its size to achieve 100% participation in community service.
That year, the Advisory Board acquired Care Team Connect,[10] a care management workflow platform, and launched the Student Success Collaborative, a software-based program that helps colleges and universities improve outcomes for at-risk and off-path students. The company also announced the acquisition of Medical Referral Source, a technology firm with software that facilitates a seamless referral process.[11]
2014 brought the acquisitions of HealthPost,[12] which helps health systems reduce referral leakage and attract new patients, and Royall & Company, which provides the higher education industry with data-driven student engagement, enrollment management, financial aid optimization, and alumni fundraising solutions.[13]
The company’s Community Impact program, meanwhile, received the 2014 Corporate Engagement Award of Excellence from Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.[14] The firm also partnered with the de Beaumont Foundation, Kresge Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to launch the BUILD Health Challenge to identify and support health partnerships taking bold, upstream, integrated, local, and data-driven approaches to improving health in low-income, urban communities.[15]
In 2015, the company announced its acquisition of Clinovations, an EMR optimization firm serving providers at the intersection of clinician workflows and information technology, and GradesFirst, a student success technology company with workflow software that enables colleges and universities to identify, engage, and support at-risk students.[16]
As of 2016, the company had grown to more than 3,600 employees, with offices on three continents. It was named as a Modern Healthcare Best Place to Work for the eighth straight year.[17]
In January 2017, the company reduced it's healthcare workforce by 220 employees, or 5.7%, exited several businesses and announced a plan to close 4 offices by the end of 2017. [18]

History[edit]
The company was founded by David G. Bradley in 1979 as the Research Council of Washington with five employees. Its original mission was to answer "any question for any company for any industry," but in 1983 the company began to specialize in research for the financial services industry and changed its name to The Advisory Board Company. By 1986, the company had launched its health care-focused strategic research division, including its first membership program, the Health Care Advisory Board.[1]
Across the next four years the firm grew to 150 employees, served more than 500 health care members, and published 15 major reports and 2,000 research briefs each year. In 1993, the firm launched a strategic research membership for large companies, bringing on almost half of the Fortune 500 within 18 months. The firm expanded in 1994 to include its first clinically based program, the Cardiology Roundtable—which has since evolved to become the Cardiovascular Roundtable—providing best practices to the nations’ cardiac programs.
In 1997, the company spun off its corporate membership group, forming The Corporate Executive Board (now CEB Inc.) as an independent company. It maintained its focus on the health care sector, working with more than 1,500 health care organizations. H*Works, a consulting business offering best practice implementation support launched in 2000, followed shortly by The Advisory Board Company’s initial public offering in 2001, in which Bradley sold his ownership interest.
By 2002, the firm topped 2,100 memberships and 500 employees, and launched The Advisory Board Academies leadership development division—now the company's Talent Development division—to address the leadership gap in health care. In 2003, the company was named to Washingtonian’s Great Places to Work and launched its business intelligence and analytics offering, Compass, providing memberships anchored by robust decision support tools. In 2005, the firm was named to Forbes’ Top 200 High-Growth Companies and again to Washingtonian's Great Places to Work.[2]
In 2007, the company launched its first membership programs in higher education, working with student and academic affairs executives at several U.S. research universities.[3] The firm continued to grow across 2008, acquiring Crimson, a data, analytics, and business intelligence software provider focused on physician performance, quality metrics, and cost of care outcomes.
By 2009, The Advisory Board Company had opened its doors in San Francisco, marking the fourth U.S. office. The firm also grew to over 1,000 employees and over 2,800 health care and higher education members. The company expanded its capabilities in the physician management terrain through the acquisition of Southwind, a management and consulting firm focused on aligning hospitals and physicians through a comprehensive set of physician employment, clinical integration, and information technology deployment solutions. During this time,the company was named to Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work—an honor it has received every year since.[4]
From 2010 to 2011, the company continued to expand, acquiring and partnering with a series of technology firms, including Milliman MedInsight, which provides population risk analytics, Cielo MedSolutions, which provides ambulatory patient registry software, and PivotHealth, a physician practice management firm.
In 2012, The Advisory Board Company acquired ActiveStrategy,[5] a performance improvement technology firm, and 360Fresh,[6] a leading provider of clinical data analytics. The firm also was named as one of Healthcare Informatics' top 100 health care IT firms[7] and Modern Healthcare's top 40 fastest-growing health care firms list.[8] During that year, the firm also provided $1 million in benefit to non-profit organizations through its Community Impact program.
In 2013, the firm was named the “#1 Best Large Company to Work For” by Modern Healthcare magazine.[9] It also became the first for-profit company of its size to achieve 100% participation in community service.
That year, the Advisory Board acquired Care Team Connect,[10] a care management workflow platform, and launched the Student Success Collaborative, a software-based program that helps colleges and universities improve outcomes for at-risk and off-path students. The company also announced the acquisition of Medical Referral Source, a technology firm with software that facilitates a seamless referral process.[11]
2014 brought the acquisitions of HealthPost,[12] which helps health systems reduce referral leakage and attract new patients, and Royall & Company, which provides the higher education industry with data-driven student engagement, enrollment management, financial aid optimization, and alumni fundraising solutions.[13]
The company’s Community Impact program, meanwhile, received the 2014 Corporate Engagement Award of Excellence from Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service.[14] The firm also partnered with the de Beaumont Foundation, Kresge Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to launch the BUILD Health Challenge to identify and support health partnerships taking bold, upstream, integrated, local, and data-driven approaches to improving health in low-income, urban communities.[15]
In 2015, the company announced its acquisition of Clinovations, an EMR optimization firm serving providers at the intersection of clinician workflows and information technology, and GradesFirst, a student success technology company with workflow software that enables colleges and universities to identify, engage, and support at-risk students.[16]
As of 2016, the company had grown to more than 3,600 employees, with offices on three continents. It was named as a Modern Healthcare Best Place to Work for the eighth straight year.[17]
In January 2017, the company reduced it's healthcare workforce by 220 employees, or 5.7%, exited several businesses and announced a plan to close 4 offices by the end of 2017. [18]

The company’s advisory board division serves 4,400+ health care members. Advisory Board forges and finds best practices, then customizes and hardwires those insights for members with research, technology, and consulting. It also publishes American Health Line, a daily health care policy briefing.

Advisory Board Technology services help members find and address opportunities by embedding best practices into operations.
The Advisory Board Consulting team provides hands-on best practice implementation, practice management solutions, and physician alignment services.

Running Customer Advisory Boards








Running Customer Advisory Boards

August 09, 2007


This article contains some tips and strategies for running effective CABs.  A Customer Advisory Board (CAB) is a representative group of customers that meets periodically to offer advice on the product and company direction. These meetings are a great way to validate that your product direction is in sync with your customers' technology and business plans. Key customers can look at your plans and provide valuable feedback about your strategy. This article contains some tips and strategies for running effective CABs.
Customer councils are usually held twice a year, although some companies run them more frequently. Some companies have two separate advisory groups that attend alternate meetings.
Logistics
Ideally the customer council meetings should be held either at your company facility or at a nearby hotel so that as many employees can attend as is appropriate. Some customer councils meet in field offices for maximum regional participation. An annual user group meeting is an ideal forum for holding smaller advisory councils since the customers are already there.
Three or four vendor employees, led by product management, facilitate the meeting. Development leads and product architects are also involved; they'll be amazed at how real people perceive the products. Sales people usually want to be on-hand if their customers are invited. A short visit by the company president or General Manager is a great way to kick off the meeting.
Be careful of making commitments in a customer advisory meeting. This is an input session, not a decision-making body. And you probably don't want to continue to hold additional meetings if you haven't delivered on the designs revealed in past meetings. The basic research rule applies: Don't research something that you're not willing to change.
Invite six to eight customer representatives. Many will want to send two people, often a technology advisor as well as a business representative of the customer.
Customers should be selected to participate in the CAB based on their ability to represent a specific market segment. We should avoid the loud-but-big customer--the ones usually suggested by sales people. However, large customers are always important to your company and may be invited purely for improving customer relations with them.
Ideally, each customer should be a bellwether for the industry they represent. Avoid inviting competing customers within the same segment so that competitors are not in the same council meeting. Competitors may be leery of discussing their challenges in front of one another.
Invitations should go out well in advance, a couple months if possible, to allow customers to schedule the meeting appropriately.
Good advisory customers will pay their own expenses to come to your corporate office. They know that steering the product future will result in a better solution for them in the long run. You don't have to motivate them with expensive gifts either; the better product is all the incentive they need. However, a standard giveaway, such as a company logo-ed pen or golf shirt, is appreciated. You should plan on supplying meals for your customers during their stay and have one event or dinner with the group.
Customers are surprisingly eager to attend customer councils. If they use your product often, they want to be taken seriously and they want their product suggestions to be heard. Having regular customer council meetings is a great way to:


Validate ideas for new products and features


Find major flaws in your current product design


Discover how customers are actually using your product


Determine the killer features of your current product


Uncover additional competitive information. After all, your customers evaluated your product next to someone else's.


Learn about future technologies your customers are evaluating and how this will impact your product's future


Listen for differences between what you hear from potential buyers on a sales call and what you hear in this meeting of customers. Remember that you are dealing with customers, not prospects. They have already bought and are indoctrinated into your way of thinking. They will be telling you about product usage, information critical to development but often not relevant to sales or marketing communications.
Agenda

Introductions of company personnel and customers. It is important that everyone is introduced. Ask that the customers not only introduce themselves, but tell a little bit about how they are using your product.
Presentations of each advisor's strategic technology plan. Ask each to present three or four slides about where their company is headed strategically, perhaps as it relates to your product, including planned shifts in technology, projected changes in employee headcount, and any new business initiatives that may have an effect.
Discussion of current challenges. Before you start talking about your strategy, take the time to listen! What challenges are your customers facing when dealing with your product and company? A Force Field Analysis is a good technique to get people talking about both the positive and negative aspects of your products and services.
Overview of product line. You will sometimes be surprised that many of your customers don't know your current product line. Give a brief overview of the features and benefits of your current products. Customers may learn that you have existing solutions to their problems.
Roadmap of product plans. The objective is to get your customers? feedback on the product plans. Ideally you want give as much information as possible and include a demonstration of a prototype if feasible, to maximize the feedback you will get. Discuss how this new capability will affect their future business plans and the impact on their employees.
Open Discussion. A good facilitator can make an open discussion very productive; without a facilitator, this often turns into a complaining session. Have a list of items for discussion, such as features ideas, new products suggestions, new technologies that your customers are using in conjunction with your products. Don't forget to ask about professional services, phone support, and web-based support. Ask how your customers get information on new products.
Breakout sessions. It is sometimes easier to get feedback in smaller groups. There may be certain discussion areas that are more interesting to some than others. By using more focused sessions you can get more detailed feedback.
Review. Review the main points from the day. Ask what they liked and disliked about the session. Solicit suggestions for improvement.

A customer advisory session is a great method of getting real customers to validate your ideas before the company is totally committed. You can test assumptions. You will learn what they truly value in your product.
Using a customer council is one way of listening to the market and keeping your product focused on solving real problems.
