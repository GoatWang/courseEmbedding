Charles W. Hull: in his own words

About the invention    
	


Category: Non-European countries


Sector: Stereolithography, mechanics


Company: 3D Systems, Inc.


Patent number: EP0171069, EP0681906, EP1946910, EP0852536







Invention: 3D printing (stereolithography)


3D printing, the additive-manufacturing technology Charles W. Hull developed, has made rapid prototyping possible and opened up new applications across countless industries. The technology could one day become one of the biggest advances in manufacturing since the industrial revolution.





In the early 1980s, Charles W. Hull set out to improve the tedious process of creating small plastic parts for prototyping involved in testing new product designs. Only one year after he had developed the first model of his 3D printer, Hull applied for a patent for his invention: a machine that could perform in a matter of minutes what would normally take several weeks of moulding and casting.


Hull, who was then working at a company that used UV light to apply thin sheets of plastic veneers onto table tops, furniture and paper products, realised that if he was able to overlay thousands of these laminate layers on top of each other and etch their shape using UV light, he could form three-dimensional objects in nearly any conceivable form. Today stereolithography has become the state of the art for prototyping new models – and an industry in itself.

Societal benefit

Printers designed by Hull’s company 3D Systems have made their way into myriad industrial and commercial uses: Medical-technology companies rely on them to create models of patients’ jaws and facial structures; an automotive safety company uses the technology to design “intelligent” crash-test dummies; a watchmaker uses 3D Systems’ printers to evaluate designs before final production – and the list goes on. From aeroplane wings and architectural models to toys and electric bicycles, countless products and prototypes come to life faster and cheaper than ever before.

Economic benefit

3D Systems, founded in 1986, became a leader in the 3D printing industry, posting sales of about US $350 million in 2012. It is now listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange and employs more than 1000 people. The market for 3D printers and 3-D printing services was valued at US $2.2 billion in 2012 (a 29% increase from 2011). According to current estimates, the annual market value will increase to US $4 billion by 2025. TechNavio forecasts the global rapid-prototyping systems market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.6% from 2011 until 2015. 

Originally used for the rapid production of prototypes for form and fit testing, 3D printing is now transitioning towards the manufacture of final products – and the 3D printing landscape keeps evolving, as new uses for the technology are being discovered every day.

How it works: 

3D Systems’ software “slices” a three-dimensional blueprint model into thousands of digital cross-sections. Each slice corresponds to a layer of the model that will be fabricated and can be as thin as 0.05 mm in the highest-resolution versions.

This information is sent to a stereolithograph apparatus, which contains a vat filled with UV-sensitive liquid photopolymer resin; a movable UV laser shines a high-intensity beam of light onto the vat and traces the complete shape of the cross-section of the object. After the laser has finished its outline, the first layer of polymer hardens. Depending on the size of the object to be produced, the process is then repeated several thousands of times, layer upon layer, until it is completed. 

The inventor:

In 1984, Charles W. Hull probably didn’t imagine that his idea to speed up prototyping would set off an avalanche that is today, 30 years later, still in motion. As many as 76 US, 18 European and 14 Japanese patents have since joined his first, and despite his 74 years Hull thinks that his field of work still is too interesting to retire. With his recent induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in the US, Hull, working actively as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of 3D Systems, has joined the ranks of figures such as Henry Ford and Steve Jobs. In other words: people who have made a lasting impact on humanity.

Did you know? 

One of the first manufacturing sectors to enjoy the benefits of Hull’s innovation was the automotive industry. Ford Motor Company conducted a study in the mid-1990s that showed Hull’s technology could save considerable time and money. Today, the technology has become a mainstay in the automotive sector, used to develop everything from high-performance, Formula 1 racing engines to forming simple levers and buttons. The technology has since taken many more industries by storm.

Chuck Hull (Charles W. Hull; born May 12, 1939) is the co-founder, executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems.[1][2] He is the inventor of the solid imaging process known as stereolithography (3D Printing), the first commercial rapid prototyping technology, and the STL file format. He is named on more than 60 U.S. patents as well as other patents around the world in the fields of ion optics and rapid prototyping. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.[3]

Early life[edit]
Chuck Hull was born on May 12, 1939 in Clifton, Colorado, the son of Lester and Esther Hull. His early life was spent in Clifton and Gateway, Colorado. He graduated from Central High School in Grand Junction, Colorado. Chuck received a BS in engineering physics from the University of Colorado in 1961.[4]
Beginnings of stereolithography[edit]
Hull first came up with the idea in 1983 when he was using UV light to harden tabletop coatings.[5] But on July 16, 1984 Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process.[6] It was three weeks before Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium).[7] The claimed reason was “for lack of business perspective”.[8] Hull coined the term “stereolithography” in his U.S. Patent 4,575,330 entitled “Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography” issued on March 11, 1986.[9] He defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively “printing” thin layers of the ultraviolet curable material one on top of the other. In Hull’s patent, a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer. The light beam, moving under computer control, draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid. Wherever the beam strikes the surface, the photopolymer polymerizes/crosslinks and changes to a solid. An advanced CAD/CAM/CAE software mathematically slices the computer model of the object into a large number of thin layers. The process then builds the object layer by layer starting with the bottom layer, on an elevator that is lowered slightly after solidification of each layer. [10]
Commercial rapid prototyping[edit]
In 1986, commercial rapid prototyping was started by Hull when he founded 3D Systems in Valencia, California.[11] Hull realized that his concept was not limited to liquids and therefore gave it the generic name “stereolithography” (3D printing),[12] and filed broad patent claims covering any “material capable of solidification” or “material capable of altering its physical state.”
Hull built up a patent portfolio covering many fundamental aspects of today’s additive manufacturing technologies such as data preparation via triangulated models (STL file format) and slicing, and exposure strategies such as alternating hatch directions. [13]
The salary for his role as 3D Systems CTO was $307,500 in 2011.[14]
Recognition[edit]

2014 winner of the European Inventor Award in the Non-European countries category [15] awarded by the European Patent Office
2015 winner of the Industrial Research Institute's IRI Achievement Award for his invention of stereolithography.

The salary for his role as 3D Systems CTO was $307,500 in 2011.[14]
Recognition[edit]

2014 winner of the European Inventor Award in the Non-European countries category [15] awarded by the European Patent Office
2015 winner of the Industrial Research Institute's IRI Achievement Award for his invention of stereolithography.

Invention of 3D Printing


Chuck Hull (Charles W. Hull; born May 12, 1939) is the co-founder, executive vice president and chief technology officer of 3D Systems.[1][2] He is the inventor of the solid imaging process known as stereolithography (3D Printing), the first commercial rapid prototyping technology, and the STL file format. He is named on more than 60 U.S. patents as well as other patents around the world in the fields of ion optics and rapid prototyping. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.[3]

Early life[edit]
Chuck Hull was born on May 12, 1939 in Clifton, Colorado, the son of Lester and Esther Hull. His early life was spent in Clifton and Gateway, Colorado. He graduated from Central High School in Grand Junction, Colorado. Chuck received a BS in engineering physics from the University of Colorado in 1961.[4]
Beginnings of stereolithography[edit]
Hull first came up with the idea in 1983 when he was using UV light to harden tabletop coatings.[5] But on July 16, 1984 Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process.[6] It was three weeks before Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium).[7] The claimed reason was “for lack of business perspective”.[8] Hull coined the term “stereolithography” in his U.S. Patent 4,575,330 entitled “Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography” issued on March 11, 1986.[9] He defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively “printing” thin layers of the ultraviolet curable material one on top of the other. In Hull’s patent, a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer. The light beam, moving under computer control, draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid. Wherever the beam strikes the surface, the photopolymer polymerizes/crosslinks and changes to a solid. An advanced CAD/CAM/CAE software mathematically slices the computer model of the object into a large number of thin layers. The process then builds the object layer by layer starting with the bottom layer, on an elevator that is lowered slightly after solidification of each layer. [10]
Commercial rapid prototyping[edit]
In 1986, commercial rapid prototyping was started by Hull when he founded 3D Systems in Valencia, California.[11] Hull realized that his concept was not limited to liquids and therefore gave it the generic name “stereolithography” (3D printing),[12] and filed broad patent claims covering any “material capable of solidification” or “material capable of altering its physical state.”
Hull built up a patent portfolio covering many fundamental aspects of today’s additive manufacturing technologies such as data preparation via triangulated models (STL file format) and slicing, and exposure strategies such as alternating hatch directions. [13]
The salary for his role as 3D Systems CTO was $307,500 in 2011.[14]
Recognition[edit]

2014 winner of the European Inventor Award in the Non-European countries category [15] awarded by the European Patent Office
2015 winner of the Industrial Research Institute's IRI Achievement Award for his invention of stereolithography.

Shane Hickey in Berlin


Sunday 22 June 2014 09.35 EDT


First published on Sunday 22 June 2014 09.35 EDT





Although measured and deliberate in his responses, there is one moment when the softly spoken Chuck Hull – known as the father of 3D printing – tells of his surprise about what exactly his creation was capable of achieving.
In 1996, surgeons at the Wilford Hall medical centre in Texas working to separate a pair of conjoined twins thought that only one would be able to walk after the operation. After a model of the girls' bone structure was generated using 3D printing, however, they found a shared upper leg bone to be bigger than expected and split it successfully, resulting in both twins being able to walk.
Hull said: "This is extremely difficult for surgeons, to figure out how they are going to separate the two twins so that you will have two separately living people. When some of those surgeries were first done using the help of our technology, it was really touching for me."
Now 75 and still working as chief technology officer of 3D Systems, the company he co-founded, Hull is enjoying some minor celebrity 31 years after he first printed a small black eye-wash cup using a new method of manufacturing called stereolithography, now known as 3D printing.
At the time, he was working for a company that used UV light to put thin layers of plastic veneers on tabletops and furniture. Like others within the industry, he was frustrated that the production of small plastic parts for prototyping new product designs could take up to two months.
He had an idea that if he could place thousands of thin layers of plastic on top of each other and then etch their shape using light, he would be able to form three dimensional objects. After a year of tinkering with ideas in a backroom lab after hours, he developed a system where light was shone into a vat of photopolymer – a material which changes from liquid to plastic-like solid when light shines on it – and traces the shape of one level of the object. Subsequent layers are then printed until it is complete.
After patenting the invention in 1986, he set up 3D Systems in order to commercialise the new method of production and went on the road to secure both funding – eventually getting $6m (£3.5m) from a Canadian investor – and customers, using videotapes to show the equipment. The first commercial product came out in 1988 and proved a hit among car manufacturers, in the aerospace sector and for companies designing medical equipment.
Soon General Motors and Mercedes-Benz were using 3D Systems' technology – the company sold printers, materials and software – to build prototypes, but it was developments in medicine that stunned him, such as when models in advance of surgery could be created. "That was just startling to me, that someone used the technology like that."
When Hull originally came up with his invention, he told his wife that it would take between 25 and 30 years before the technology would find its way into the home. That prediction proved correct as the realistic prospect of widespread commercial 3D printers has only emerged in recent years.
The possibilities appear endless – from home-printed food and pharmaceuticals to suggestions that pictures of ceramics will be able to be taken in shops and then recreated using plans downloaded from the internet.
Hull, an unassuming man who has 93 patents to his name in the US and 20 in Europe, says he is "humbled" by the possibilities but stops short of predicting what his technology could eventually deliver, although he is confident printers could soon be in every home.
"It's nice to get some recognition, it was a lot of hard work but other than that I just keep working," he said last week in Berlin, where he received a European Inventor Award.
Controversy has arisen with the possibility that guns will be able to be produced using 3D printing, again using blueprints downloaded from the internet. A group called Defense Distributed last year successfully tested a 3D printed gun in Texas. Hull said: "My first thought is that people messing with that – I hope they don't hurt themselves. Building and testing guns of that nature could be dangerous. I think the people doing that were trying to make a point.
"I don't know that people are going to be printing guns around the world but in any case our company, we are not the government or the police agencies. It is more their business and all technology, the governments and the police have to be aware [of], it is not just 3D printing."
After finding that retirement was not for him, Hull returned to the company he co-founded and is now vice-president as well as chief technology officer, and holds shares worth $20m (£12m). Last year, 3D Systems brought in revenues of more than $500m (£294m) and has three bases in the UK, in Hemel Hempstead, High Wycombe and Clevedon. New systems of 3D printing have emerged over the years and various other firms have been added to the 3D Systems stable.
Last week the company launched the Ekocycle Cube printer in a collaboration with the singer Will.i.am, named chief creative officer in January, which is touted as being for everyday use and priced at $1,199 (£705).
Stepping down is not an option at the moment for Hull, who declares the products of 3D printing, now including ranges of jewellery, as "all his children". Future projects include working with Google on the company's next generation phone.
"We always say which room is it going to be in? I am not much of a futurist. It is really difficult for me to project. I sit there and work on the projects I have and I don't have a lot of say on where this is going."
What can be printed?
On a small plot in the north of Amsterdam, architects are building what they hope will be the first 3D-printed house. They are laying blocks that have been printed using a scaled-up version of an open-source 3D printer to be stacked like Lego bricks – one of the more elaborate examples of what can be produced using 3D printing.
The recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas showcased printers that could produce foods such as ravioli and chocolate printed patterns, while Harvard researchers have recently unveiled what they say is the first 3D printed battery, which can be constructed in minutes.
New in Tech this week
• Will your next phone be 3D? Amazon's new Fire Phone uses a system of four cameras to constantly track its user's face and makes objects appear 3D using "dynamic perspective" – shifting the image around as the user tilts their head. Users can nod and use other gestures to navigate the phone too, which uses Amazon's own version of the Android software. But a camera on the back that can instantly recognise objects, books, art and goods is the killer feature for the online superstore. Point the phone at a book, snap a picture and buy it from Amazon with one tap. Yet another attack on the high street.
• Paranoid about drones watching your every move? The personal drone detection system could be for you. The black box, which claims to beep when a non-military drone flies within 15 metres of it, is available on the crowd funding site Kickstarter. What you actually do about a drone intruding on your airspace is left to you.
• Yo! A single word that has gone viral thanks to a stupidly simple app. The Yo app for Android and iPhone literally just sends the word "yo" to friends, contacts or complete strangers. One word can mean so many things with the right context, enough to earn the free app's creators more than $1m (£588,000) in funding at least.
• Microsoft has taken strides towards delivering longer battery life. The software giant has launched new wireless charging smart trousers that power up your phone while it's in your pocket. Designed by British fashion designer Adrien Sauvage for the "Modern Man" (what about the rest of us?), the trousers use inductive charging to power a Nokia Lumia smartphone without wires. Never be left with a dead phone battery again.
• What do the Vulcan salute, a chipmunk and chilli have in common? They are all brand new emoji – small cartoons of objects that can be sent instead of words. More than 250 new emoji have been added to the Unicode 7 specification, which defines how text is handled or expressed in computer programs. The little characters could soon be winging their way across your chat apps, email, internet and Word documents.Samuel Gibbs

Employees







Hull, Charles W
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Hull, Charles W carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Hull, Charles W



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Hull, Charles W



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
