Cross Shore Discovery Fund
Cross Shore Discovery Fund (“Fund”) is a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in private investment vehicles or “hedge funds” (“Portfolio Funds”) managed by a variety of different investment managers. The Portfolio Funds are not registered under the 1940 Act and the Fund principally invests in Portfolio Funds organized outside of the U.S.
The Fund’s investment objective is to seek rates of return over a full market cycle that exceed the average rate of return of the HFRI Equity Hedge Index with capital draw downs and overall volatility less than broad U.S. equity market indices. A capital draw down is a period during which the Fund’s net asset value (the “NAV”) is below its most recent, highest NAV. The HFRI Equity Hedge Index, an equally weighted performance index, consists of investment managers who maintain positions both long and short in primarily equity and equity derivative securities.
In order to achieve its investment objective, the Adviser allocates the Fund’s assets among Portfolio Funds whose investment managers generally manage less than $1 billion in assets at the time of the Fund’s investment, employ a long/short equity strategy and have a minimum of five years’ experience in equity research or portfolio management. The Fund cannot guarantee that its investment objective will be achieved or that its investment program will be successful .

Disclosures
The Cross Shore Discovery Fund is distributed by Unified Financial Securities, LLC (Member FINRA). You may research the Distributor, Unified Financial Securities, LLC using FINRA’s BrokerCheck at: http://brokercheck.finra.org/
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Cross Shore Discovery Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained at www.crossshorefunds.com or by calling 844-300-7828. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. 
An investment in the Fund is speculative, involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. It is possible that you may lose some or all of your investment and attempts by the Fund to manage the risks of investing in Portfolio Funds does not imply that your investment in the Fund is low risk or without risk. An investment in the Fund is illiquid and is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest. You may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time and you should not expect to be able to sell your Shares regardless of how your investment in the Fund performs. You do not have the right to require the Fund to redeem or repurchase your Shares although the Fund may periodically offer to repurchase Shares on such terms as may be determined by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (“Board”). Shares are not, and are not expected to be, listed for trading on any securities exchange. To the Fund’s knowledge, there is no, nor will there be, any secondary trading market for the Shares. Shares are subject to substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund’s Declaration of Trust. Because you may not be able to sell your Shares, you will not be able to reduce your investment exposure to the Fund on any market downturn. Please see additional disclosure of Risks in the Prospectus.
Control Risk – The Adviser will not have control of, or have the ability to exercise influence over, the trading policies or strategies of a Portfolio Fund. Investment decisions of the Portfolio Funds are also made independently of each other so that, at any particular time, one Portfolio Fund may be purchasing shares of an issuer whose shares are being sold at the same time by another Portfolio Fund. Transactions of this sort could result in the Fund directly or indirectly incurring certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result.
Expense Layering Risk – In addition to its own expenses, the Fund will also bear its allocable share of the costs and expenses of each Portfolio Fund, including its allocable share of the management and incentive compensation paid to an Investment Manager. As a result, the Fund’s investments in the Portfolio Funds may result in the Fund paying higher expenses than other funds with similar investment objectives and strategies or if it invested directly in the securities held by the Portfolio Funds. Also, each Investment Manager generally will be entitled to receive a management fee of between 1% and 2% and a performance-based allocation, expected to range up to 20% of a Portfolio Fund’s net profits.
Long/Short Equity Strategy Risk – The success of a long/short equity strategy is contingent upon an Investment Manager’s ability to correctly identify investment opportunities with the highest probability of success (long positions) and/or those with the highest probability of failure (short positions). Substantial losses may be recognized as a result of the implementation of this strategy.
Before making an investment decision, you or your adviser should consider factors such as net worth, income, age, risk tolerance and liquidity needs in evaluating whether the Fund is a suitable investment for you. Short-term investors and investors who cannot bear the loss of some or all of their investment or the risks associated with the limited liquidity of an investment in the Fund should not invest in the Fund.

Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."                                  Add Data Columns to this Table Learn about our Custom Views   Want to use this as  your default charts setting?
