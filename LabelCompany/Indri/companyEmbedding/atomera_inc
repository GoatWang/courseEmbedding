Infrastructure





Everything you do on the web is driven by data centers, powerful server farms, and communication gear that form the core of the network infrastructure.  A large data center can use as much electricity as a small town – far more of it for cooling than for powering all that equipment.  Atomera’s ability to significantly lower power consumption and increase processor performance will result in a greener planet, by reducing energy in both the equipment and the cooling systems.

MST® Platform Technology
Over the last ten years, Atomera has undertaken significant laboratory testing and engaged with a wide range of semiconductor industry and academic technology leaders to evaluate MST® performance on test chips in industrial fabrication environments.
We believe this testing has demonstrated that MST® offers performance benefits beyond and in most cases additive to those provided by already successful semiconductor performance technologies (e.g. stress liners).
Our engineering team believes that the technologies underlying MST® can be part of a larger platform of reengineered materials beyond CMOS, including:

Faster and more efficient nano-structured semiconductor materials for electronic applications
Enhanced nano-structured materials for application in photonics
Improved magnetic materials for advanced memory

Internet of Things





The Internet of Things, or IOT, is driving a new wave of growth in electronics.  According to IC Insights, “in 2005 people connected to the Internet by computers, web-enabled cellphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other systems worldwide reached 1 billion. By the end of 2015, more than 3.2 billion humans were connected to the Internet globally.”
IOT growth is driven by machine-to-machine connectivity, a megatrend that promises to change nearly everything in our world. Consumers are already exposed to smart wearables, automotive infotainment and sensor systems, data collecting appliances and utilities at our homes, etc.  Still, 99% of things have yet to be connected, according to CISCO and GE. The IOT market trend is expected to fuel growth in cost effective semiconductor devices such as microcontrollers, embedded processors and network ICs. Atomera’s MST® technology enables a whole new set of tools for designers to develop cost sensitive, high performance and low power ICs in the field of IOT.

After the payment of underwriting discounts of 8.3% on the sale of the shares
offered hereby and estimated offering expenses of $685,000, the net proceeds of
this offering will be approximately $21,323,000. We intend to apply the
estimated net proceeds of the offering as follows:

                                                        Amount      Percent 
         Development engineering                     $ 13,817,304     64.8 %
         Business development, sales and marketing   $  3,326,388     15.6 %
         Research                                    $  1,513,933      7.1 %
         Working Capital                             $  2,665,375     12.5 %
         Total Net Proceeds                          $ 21,323,000      100 %

We intend to apply approximately $13.8 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards development engineering, which will consist primarily of our
further development and qualification of MST® and the evaluation, testing and
engineering involved in the formal product qualification process undertaken by
our potential customers. As our marketing and business development efforts lead
to a significant indication of interest on the part of a potential customer, we
will engage in development engineering for purposes of characterizing our
solution to the goals and needs of the customer, and work with customer to tune
our MST® to their unique production process and equipment.

We intend to apply approximately $3.3 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards business development, marketing and sales. In the initial
stages of our marketing and business development, we expect to spend a
significant amount of time and capital in defining the benefits of MST® for each
target customer, including simulation, modeling, data collection, marketing
costs, market research, partnership development, and business development
efforts.

We intend to apply approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds of this
offering towards research spending, including long-term investigation into
additional advanced materials and techniques for our platform, efforts with our
academic and scientific partners, and maintenance of our patent portfolio.

The net proceeds allocated towards working capital will be applied towards our
costs of facilities, information technology, public company related costs,
including accounting and legal, along with normal recurring general and
administrative expenses.

Our estimated use of proceeds is based on our current assumptions and estimates
concerning the costs and timelines of securing one or more IDMs or fabless
semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license MST®technology and start
full-scale industrial production of a device that incorporates our MST®
technology. If our assumptions or estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may
require additional funds in order to carry out the activities described above.
In addition, the expected allocation of net proceeds set forth above represents
our best estimates based upon our present plans and our assumptions regarding
industry conditions and our anticipated future revenues and expenditures. We may
find it necessary to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described
categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes in order to carry out
our business plan if those assumptions change.

If the underwriter exercises its right to purchase additional 480,000 shares of
common stock to cover over-allotments, we may receive up to an additional
$3,301,200, after deducting $298,800 for underwriting discounts. We intend to
apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option to working
capital. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities
such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.


Our lead product, MST®, is a proprietary and patent protected performance
enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering
challenges facing the semiconductor industry. We compete with IDMs, OEMs,
foundries, fabless manufacturers of semiconductors and semiconductor IP
licensing companies, for the development and commercialization of technologies
that improve the performance of semiconductors. Historically, when a new
fabrication process proves to be a low-cost improvement to the standard
fabrication process, and is additive, rather than in place of other performance
technologies, it has been successfully adopted industry-wide. Good examples of
such advances have been strained silicon, such as SiGe. We believe that MST® has
the potential to be one of these low-cost additive technologies, in which case
MST® would not be subject to significant direct competition from other
technologies.


Company Description
We are engaged in the business of developing, commercializing and licensing
proprietary processes and technologies for the $350+ billion semiconductor
industry. Our lead technology, named Mears Silicon Technology™, or MST®, is a
thin film of reengineered silicon, typically 100 to 300 angstroms


 (or
approximately 20 to 60 silicon atomic unit cells) thick. MST® can be applied as
a transistor channel enhancement to CMOS-type transistors, the most widely used
transistor type in the semiconductor industry. MST® is our proprietary and
patent-protected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a
number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry. We
believe that by incorporating MST®, transistors can be smaller, with increased
speed, reliability and energy efficiency. In addition, since MST® is an additive
and low cost technology, it can be deployed on an industrial scale, with
machines commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing. We believe that MST® can
be widely incorporated into the most common types of semiconductor products,
including analog, logic, optical and memory integrated circuits.

We do not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly. Instead,
we intend to develop and license technologies and processes that will offer the
designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a low-cost solution to the
industry need for greater performance and lower power consumption.

In the mid-1980s, our founder, Dr. Robert Mears, was part of a team that
re-engineered silica optical fiber to invent the erbium-doped fiber amplifier,
or EDFA, a technology that increased the bandwidth of optical fiber more than
1,000 times. The invention of EDFA helped to revolutionize the development of
broadband and to this day remains a key technology in the optical communications
industry. Dr. Mears anticipated scaling problems for silicon semiconductors and
founded Atomera Incorporated in order to address those problems for the
semiconductor industry.

Over the last ten years, we have undertaken significant laboratory testing and
engaged with a range of semiconductor industry and academic technology leaders
to evaluate MST® performance on test chips in industrial fabrication
environments. We believe this testing has demonstrated that MST®offers
performance benefits beyond and in most cases additive to those provided by
already successful semiconductor performance enhancement technologies, such as
dual stress liners and source/drain channel stressors, such as eSiGe/eSiC, and
can be implemented without significant additional cost or significant
modification to the current semiconductor fabrication process.

We are now in the process of transitioning MST® technology toward commercial
adoption. We are currently in the early stages of process qualification with
leading integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, and foundries. The IDMs and
foundries are our intended customers and by way of the process qualification
stage they test and evaluate the potential incorporation of our MST® technology
into the integrated circuits they produce. We are also partnering with
manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication equipment and developers of modeling
tools. These parties are part of a semiconductor infrastructure supporting the
industry with manufacturing capital equipment for transistor production and
transistor process modeling software, and we are in discussions with certain
equipment manufacturers and tool developers concerning their incorporation of
our MST® technology into the equipment and tools they offer to the industry.
Assuming the timely and successful completion of process and subsequent product
qualification by customers and partners, we expect MST®enabled product revenue
in 2017.

Semiconductors





Semiconductors have literally changed the world, and Atomera’s MST® is improving semiconductors to enable the next generation of semiconductor products.  From the invention of the semiconductor transistor in 1947 to today, there has been a relentless pursuit of more, better, faster to produce products that represent nothing short of some of the most innovative technological advances in the history of mankind.  The pace of these advances however is slowing due to reaching the limits of what traditional semiconductor technology can produce.  We at Atomera have developed the next generation of semiconductor technology, MST® or Mears Silicon Technology, which will allow continued advances in semiconductor products.  New, more powerful products with MST® depend only on our collective creativity and innovation.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
