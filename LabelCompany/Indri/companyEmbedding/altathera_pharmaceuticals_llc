You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Sotalol Hydrochloride (ALTATHERA Pharmaceuticals, LLC): FDA Package Insert

 







DrugInserts.com
Prescription Medications



    


Sotalol Hydrochloride: Package Insert and Label InformationBy ALTATHERA Pharmaceuticals, LLC | Last revised: 1 November 2015
SOTALOL HYDROCHLORIDE- sotalol hydrochloride injectionALTATHERA Pharmaceuticals, LLC
 WARNING: LIFE THREATENING PROARRHYTHMIA To minimize the risk of induced arrhythmia, patients initiated or re-initiated on intravenous sotalol, and patients who are converted from intravenous to oral administration should be hospitalized in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and calculations of creatinine clearance. 
 •  Sotalol can cause life threatening ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation 




 •  Do not initiate sotalol therapy if the baseline QTc is longer than 450 ms. If the QT interval prolongs to 500 ms or greater, the dose must be reduced, the duration of the infusion prolonged or the drug discontinued 
 •  Adjust the dosing interval based on creatinine clearance 
 1  INDICATIONS AND USAGE   1.1  Substitution for Oral Sotalol Therapy  Intravenous sotalol can substitute for oral sotalol in patients who are unable to take sotalol orally.
 1.2 Delay in Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter  Sotalol is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm [delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AFIB/AFL)] in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently in sinus rhythm. Because sotalol can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it should be reserved for patients in whom AFIB/AFL is highly symptomatic. Patients with paroxysmal AFIB whose AFIB/AFL is easily reversed (by Valsalva maneuver, for example) should usually not be given sotalol. In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for AFIB/AFL aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm. Recurrence is expected in some patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2) ].
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice.
 1.3 Documented Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmia  Sotalol is indicated for the treatment of documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Because of  the proarrhythmic effects of sotalol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ] including a 1.5 to 2% rate of Torsade de  Pointes or new VT/VF in patients with either NSVT  or supraventricular arrhythmias, its use  in patients with less severe arrhythmias, even if the patients are symptomatic, is generally not recommended. Treatment of patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature contractions should be avoided. In life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the response to treatment should then be evaluated by a suitable method (e.g., PES or Holter monitoring) at steady state blood levels of drug prior to continuing the patient on chronic therapy. Antiarrhythmic drugs may not enhance survival in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.
2 DOSAGE  AND ADMINISTRATION The Cockcroft-Gault formulaFor children about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph which shows age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.2 .1  General Rules  and Safety Measures  of Intravenous  Sotalol Therapy For the safety of the patient, the safety measures required of oral sotalol administration must also be applied for intravenous route. To minimize the risk of induced arrhythmia, patients initiated or re-initiated on sotalol should be hospitalized for at least three days or until steady state drug levels are achieved, in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate intravenous sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy with starting sotalol injection. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval for sotalol.
If the baseline QT is greater than 450 ms (JT >330 ms if QRS over 100 ms), sotalol is not recommended. The patient’s creatinine clearance should be calculated using the one of several formulas. The Cockcroft-Gault formula to determine creatinine clearance is:
    (click image for full-size original) When serum creatinine is given in µmol/L, divide the value by 88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 µmol/L).
Start sotalol therapy only if the baseline QT interval is <450 ms. During initiation and titration, monitor the QT interval after the completion of each infusion. If the QT interval prolongs to 500 ms or greater, reduce the dose, decrease the infusion rate, or discontinue the drug.
Administer sotalol twice daily in patients with a creatinine clearance >60 mL/min or once daily) in patients with a creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mL/min. Sotalol is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance <40 mL/min. The recommended initial IV dose of sotalol is 75 mg (once or twice daily) and is initiated as shown in the dosing algorithm described below. The 75 mg dose can be titrated upward to 112.5 or 150 mg after at least 3 days [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) ].
2.2  Dose of Intravenous Sotalol The bioavailability of oral sotalol is between 90% and 100%. The corresponding dose of intravenous sotalol is, therefore, slightly less than that of the oral dose. The effects of the initial intravenous dose must be monitored and the dose titrated either upward or downward, if needed, based on clinical effect, QT interval, or adverse reactions.
Table 1: Conversion from Oral Sotalol to Intravenous SotalolOral dose Once or twice daily Intravenous dose Once or twice daily Administered over 5 hours 80 mg 75  mg (5 mL sotalol injection) 120 mg 112.5  mg (7.5  mL sotalol injection) 160 mg 150  mg (10  mL sotalol injection) 2.3 Preparation  of Sotalol Infusion Intravenous sotalol must be diluted for infusion. Appropriate diluents are saline, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or Ringer’s lactate. Usually, prepare in a volume of 100-250 mL. Use a volumetric infusion    pump to infuse intravenous sotalol at a constant rate. The following table compensates for dead space in the infusion set.
Table 2: Sotalol Infusion Preparation to Compensate for Dead Space in Infusion SetTarget Dose Sotalol Injection Diluent Volume Prepared Volume to Infuse 75 mg 6 mL 114 mL 120 mL 100 mL 112.5 mg 9 mL 111 mL 100 mL 150 mg 12 mL 108 mL 100 mL 75 mg 6 mL 294 mL 300 mL 250 mL 112.5 mg 9 mL 291 mL 250 mL 150 mg 12 mL 288 mL 250 mL 2.4 Initiation  of Intravenous  Sotalol Therapy The starting dose of intravenous sotalol is 75 mg infused over 5 hours once or twice daily based on the creatinine clearance. Monitor ECG for excessive increase in QTc.
2.5 Upward  Titration of Dose If the 75 mg dose of intravenous sotalol does not reduce the frequency of relapses of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias or symptomatic AFIB/AFL and is tolerated without excessive (i.e., to >500 ms) QTc prolongation, increase the dose to 112.5 mg infused over 5 hours, once or twice daily depending upon the creatinine clearance. Continue to monitor QTc during dose escalations.
2.6 Dose  for Ventricular Arrhythmias The recommended initial dose of intravenous sotalol is 75 mg infused over 5 hours, once or twice daily based on creatinine clearance. The dose may be increased in increments of 75 mg/day every 3 days. The usual therapeutic effect is observed with oral doses of 80 to 160 mg once or twice a day    (corresponding to 75 to 150 mg intravenous sotalol). Oral doses as high as 240-320 mg once or twice a day (corresponding to 225 to 300 mg intravenous sotalol) have been utilized in patients with refractory life-threatening arrhythmias.
2.7  Dose for Symptomatic AFIB/AFL In the U.S. multicenter dose-response study, 120 mg  orally once or twice a day (corresponding to  112.5  mg intravenous sotalol) was found to be the most effective dose in prolonging the time to  ECG-  documented symptomatic  recurrence of AFIB/AFL. If  that dose level, at steady state, does not reduce    the frequency of early relapse of arrhythmia and is tolerated without excessive QTc prolongation (>520 ms), increase the dose to 160 mg  orally once or twice a day (corresponding to  150 mg  intravenous  sotalol).
2.8  Dosing and Administration in Children Intravenous sotalol has not been studied in children. As in adults the following precautionary measures should be considered when initiating sotalol treatment in children: initiation of treatment in the hospital after appropriate clinical assessment; individualized regimen as appropriate; gradual increase of doses if required; careful assessment of therapeutic response and tolerability; and frequent monitoring of the QTc interval and heart rate. For children aged about 2 years and greater, with normal renal function, doses normalized for body surface area are appropriate for both initial and incremental dosing. Since the Class III potency in   children [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2) ] is not very different from that in adults, reaching plasma concentrations that occur within the adult dose range is an appropriate guide. From pediatric pharmacokinetic data the following is recommended. For initiation of treatment, 30 mg/m2 three times a day (90 mg/m2 total daily dose) is approximately equivalent to the initial 160 mg total oral daily dose    for adults. Subsequent titration to a maximum of 60 mg/m2 (approximately equivalent to the 360 mg total daily dose for adults) can then occur. Titration should be guided by clinical response, heart rate and QTc, with increased dosing being carried out in-hospital. At least 36 hours should be allowed between dose increments to attain steady-state plasma concentrations of sotalol in patients with age-adjusted normal renal function.
For children about 2 years or younger the above pediatric dosage should be reduced by a factor that depends heavily upon age, as shown in the following graph which shows age plotted on a logarithmic scale in months.
    (click image for full-size original) For a child aged 20 months, the dosing suggested for children with normal renal function aged 2 years  or greater should be multiplied by about 0.97; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.97) = 29.1  mg/m2 , administered orally three times daily. For a child aged 1 month, the starting dose should be multiplied by 0.68; the initial starting dose would be (30 × 0.68) = 20 mg/m2 , administered orally three times daily. For a child aged 1 week, the initial starting oral dose should be multiplied by 0.3; the    starting dose would be (30 × 0.3) = 9 mg/m2. Similar calculations should be made for increased doses   as titration proceeds. Since the half-life of sotalol decreases with decreasing age (below about 2    years), time to steady-state will also increase. Thus, in neonates the time to steady-state may be as long as a week or longer.
In all children, individualization of dosage is required. As in adults sotalol should be used with particular caution in children if the QTc is greater than 500 ms on therapy and serious consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing therapy when QTc exceeds 550 ms.
The use of oral sotalol in children with renal impairment has not been investigated. Sotalol elimination   is predominantly via the kidney in the unchanged form. Use of sotalol in any age group with decreased renal function should be at lower doses or at increased intervals between doses. Monitoring of heart rate and QTc is most important. It will take much longer to reach steady-state with any dose and/or frequency of administration in these children.
 3  DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 150 mg sotalol hydrochloride in 10 mL vial (15 mg/mL).
 4   CONTRAINDICATIONS   Sinus bradycardia (<50 bpm), sick sinus syndrome or second or third degree AV block unless a functioning  pacemaker  is present Congenital or acquired long  QT  syndromes, QT  interval >450 ms Cardiogenic  shock, uncontrolled heart failure Creatinine  clearance  <40 mL/min Serum potassium <4 meq/L Bronchial asthma or related bronchospastic conditions Known hypersensitivity to sotalol

Sotalol Hydrochloride (ALTATHERA Pharmaceuticals, LLC): FDA Package Insert,...

Prescription Medications



    


Sotalol Hydrochloride: Package Insert and Label Information (Page 5 of 5)By ALTATHERA Pharmaceuticals, LLC | Last revised: 1 November 2015
14.3  Clinical Studies in Patients  with Myocardial Infarction In a multicenter double-blind randomized study reported by Julian et al, the effect of sotalol 320 mg once daily was compared with that of placebo in 1456 patients (randomized 3:2, sotalol to placebo) surviving an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Treatment was started 5-14 days after infarction. Patients were followed for 12 months. The mortality rate was 7.3% in the sotalol group and 8.9% in the placebo group, not a statistically significant difference. Although the results do not show evidence of a benefit   of sotalol in this population, they do not show an added risk in post MI patients receiving sotalol. There was, however, a suggestion of an early (i.e., first 10 days) excess mortality (3% on sotalol vs. 2% on placebo).




In a second small trial (n=17 randomized to sotalol) where sotalol was administered at high doses (e.g., 320 mg twice daily) to high-risk post-infarction patients (ejection fraction <40% and either >10 VPC/hr or VT on Holter), there were 4 fatalities and 3 serious hemodynamic/electrical adverse events within two weeks of initiating sotalol.
 16 HOW SUPPLIED/ STORAGE AND HANDLING Intravenous sotalol is supplied in 10 mL vials, each containing 150 mg of sotalol hydrochloride (15 mg/mL).

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
