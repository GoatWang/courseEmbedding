| In the News



For over 17 years, we have deployed and continually refined a consistent investment philosophy.


We believe in partnership.   We believe that successful investing involves much more than financial capital.  We are active minority investors, providing strategic support and global resources to our portfolio companies.  We work closely with management to execute intelligent growth plans.
			

We believe in globalization.  We believe that the world economy is deeply and irrevocably integrated.  We believe that the most successful companies must have a global perspective and be truly internationally competitive.
			




We believe in building value.  We believe that sustainable investment returns are generated not by financial engineering but by intelligent growth and thoughtful internationalization.   We are patient investors with a long-term outlook.
			

We believe in transparency & risk management.  We maintain high levels of transparency and risk management for our stakeholders.  We hold our portfolio companies to these same standards of governance.
