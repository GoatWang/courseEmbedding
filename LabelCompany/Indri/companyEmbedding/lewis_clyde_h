'FRANKENBUGS' - July 22, 2017

2 days ago
            ·
            197 minutes

Mutant insects or genetically modified bugs have been in the news of late, as our hot and humid summer weather is causing a proliferation of arthropods. Some scientists feel that “frankenbugs” will help in significantly decreasing infestation, but are they messing with the cycle and balance of nature? Furthermore, the U.S. government has not only researched and developed insect-like MAVs, but for several years, has been furtively employing them for domestic surveillance purposes. On tonight’s show, Clyde Lewis talks about FRANKENBUGS.

        Amazing content and educational
If you are a critical thinker and use your brain then this show is for you. It is NOT a one dimensional show either. Clyde is good at varying the topics yet maintaining updates on current events. I do not agree with 100% of the content that is presented by him and callers but that's the beauty of the show. Information is presented and YOU the listener make an informed decision for yourself. I respect the heck out of Clyde for allowing his listeners to come to their own conclusions about the info presented. I haven't missed a show in about a year.

        Introduced to something better
I believe the shows to be very intriguing and entertaining and one of the most informative shows that is on anywhere. I also like the way he stands up for what he believes in and doesn't just pacify every person that wants to challenge what he may be speaking about for that day. At first I was truly upset that they introduced Ground Zero on my local radio station due to the fact that they played it in the spot where the Coast to Coast with George Noorey played their shows previous nights show. This upset me because that was the only chance I got to listen to Coast to Coast, but after listening to Ground Zero for awhile, I really liked it even better. Now Ground Zero is all I ever listen to while driving, thanks to Stitcher.

        Great Show!
I found this show about 2 months ago. I listen almost every night.If its not live I listen to a repeat show. I always learn something new.  I would compare it to the "Art Bell" days of Coast to Coast. Very entertaining, informative and it always makes me think about things with a new perspective. It causes me to "think" and that's a good thing!

        Re: The Ground Zero Team
I first found out about this show in prison and listened to it on AM 560 in Northern Connecticut and was (and still am) deeply impressed with the truthfulness and diversity of the topics that "mainstream media" were not covering. Mr. Lewis is a very well educated, well spoken, and isn't afraid to speak his mind regarding the truth. I thank not only Mr. Lewis, but the entire Ground Zero team for not just putting on a great show, but for being one of the few shows to actually do the research and KNOW what they're talking about. Keep up the fantastic work.

        Clyde Lewis is simply amazing!
To say Ground Zero is addictive! Late night radio has a new KING, GZ is never boring. Hold onto your hat when Clyde talks politics...everyone is fair game.
