Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.

mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger[2] and Kevin J. Kinsella.[3] Vertex was one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry.
By 2004, its product pipeline focused on viral infections, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. It maintains headquarters in South Boston, Massachusetts, and two research facilities, in San Diego, California, and Oxford, England. The company's beginnings were profiled by Barry Werth in the 1994 book The Billion-Dollar Molecule[3] and its further development in his 2014 book, The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma.[4] In 2009, the company had about 1,800 employees, including 1,200 in the Boston area.[2]
In January 2014, Vertex completed its move from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Boston, Massachusetts, and took residence in a new, $800 million complex. Located on the South Boston waterfront, it will mark the first time in the company's history that all of the roughly 1,200 Vertex employees in the Greater Boston area will be working together.
Since late 2011, when Jeffrey M. Leiden joined Vertex as CEO, Vertex has ranked among the top 15 best performing companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500. Vertex shares increased 250 percent in the same period.[5] Vertex posted only one annual profit since it was founded in 1989.[5]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]
Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices.[20]

"We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R & D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."
— David M. Orenstein, MD et al.

The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[19]
On April 15, 2015 in Cambridge, MA, Joan Finnegan Brooks of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, spoke about the role of Vertex and venture philanthropy to a panel of biotech leaders hosted by Life Sciences Foundation on the topic of patient advocacy in the biotech industry.[21] While Brooks, who has Cystic Fibrosis, expressed gratitude for Vertex' development of Kalydeco, she observed that 25% of Cystic Fibrosis patients are not getting the medical care they need because of the prohibitive cost of the drug.[21]

Telaprevir[edit]
In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson & Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor.[6]
Cystic fibrosis[edit]
Ivacaftor[edit]
In 2012 ivacaftor, was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval [7] of the first drug, Kalydeco,[8] to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis rather than the symptoms, in patients 6 years or older who have the G551D gene mutation. In the US, 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis. About 4% of those, or 1,200, have the G551D gene mutation. Vertex is marketing the drug at $307,000 a year per patient.[9] Vertex also is studying ivacaftor in combination with another drug (lumacaftor[10]) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug.[11]
In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds[12] of £20,000-£30,000.
On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.[13] In 2015, FDA approved Orkambi lumacaftor/ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years and older, who have the F508del mutation.[14]
mRNA therapeutics[edit]
In 2016, the company entered into a collaboration with Moderna, in fact taking an ownership stake in the company, to develop new mRNA-based therapeutics to treat CF.[15]
Venture philanthropy[edit]
In the late 1990s the Bethesda-based Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, encouraged by then-President Robert Beall, began investing in Vertex— when it was a small start-up biotechnology company— to help fund the development of Kalydeco in the form of venture philanthropy. The total investment amounted to $150 million.[16] In 2014, the CF Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.[16][17]
By 2015 the annual cost of Kalydeco had risen to more than $300,000 per patient.[18]
According to an article published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Vertex executives "grossed more than $100 million by cashing in stocks and stock options" and at "one point, the value of company's stock increased more $6 billion in a single day."[19]

PRESS RELEASE
Joshua Boger Joins Alkeus Pharmaceuticals
Joshua Boger, founder and retired CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, to serve as Executive Chairman
Boston, Massachusetts (May 23, 2012) �

Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alkeus Pharma) announced today that Joshua Boger, Ph.D., has been appointed Executive Chairman of the company�s Board of Directors. Bringing over 30 years of experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, Dr. Boger joins for the first time another pharmaceutical company since he started Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vertex) in 1989 and retired in May 2009. As CEO of Vertex, he led the company�s efforts to develop science-based, transformative medicines, which have since turned the company into a successful global business.

Alkeus Pharma lead compound, ALK-001, is an oral drug investigated as a treatment for Stargardt disease, the leading cause of juvenile macular degeneration. ALK-001 has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate human clinical trials, and the company is preparing a multicenter study to test whether ALK-001 could offer a clinical benefit to children and adults affected by Stargardt disease. Interested individuals are welcome to register their names on Alkeus Pharma� Pharma website (www.alkeuspharma.com).


Stargardt disease is an untreatable and progressive genetic condition that leads to blindness in almost all of those who have it. Many patients experience first visual symptoms before the age of twenty. The condition originates from a genetic mutation that causes malfunction of a protein used in the recycling of the vitamin A contained in the eye. Poor processing of vitamin A results in the formation of excessive toxic deposits in the eye followed by vision loss. Dysfunction of this protein has also been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the number one cause of blindness in the Western world.


Dr. Boger commented, "I have been impressed by Alkeus Pharma� leadership, the progress achieved to date and the ambitious program. I am eager to actively participate in the development of a treatment for a major cause of childhood blindness. ALK-001�s underlying science is one of the most elegant I have seen and the animal data corroborate its promise to treat Stargardt disease. We will work hard in collaboration with retinal experts to bring this drug through clinical trials."


"Joshua joins at a very exciting time.  His leadership, experience and track record in the field of drug development, including medicines for rare genetic diseases, will be critical to our company�s future�, added Leonide Saad, Ph.D., President and CEO of Alkeus Pharma. �Joshua�s lifelong commitment to good science and to having an impact on patients� lives is admirable. It is our greatest honor to welcome him aboard as we work relentlessly to develop treatments for blindness."


Besides leading the way in the use of structure-based rational drug design as the basis for drug discovery, Dr. Joshua Boger pioneered alliances between Pharma companies and disease-focused foundations by partnering with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to discover and develop new cystic fibrosis (CF) medicines.  This resulted early 2012 in the marketing approval of Vertex first CF medicine, one of the first oral drugs to address the root cause of a genetic condition. 


Beyond his role as Executive Chairman of Alkeus Pharma, Dr. Boger continues to serve on the board of Vertex. He is also the Chair of the Board of Fellows of the Harvard Medical School, Chair of the Board of Trustees at Wesleyan University, Chair of NEHI (the Network for Healthcare Innovation, Cambridge), board member of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, the Hastings Center and the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.


He is also the Chair of the Board of the Celebrity Series, Vice-Chair of the Alliance for Business Leadership, Vice-Chair of the Museum of Science (Boston), and serves on additional boards such as the Harvard Board of Overseers, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts Foundation, the Science Advisory Council of WGBH, the Massachusetts Workforce Investment Board and MassChallenge.


Prior to founding Vertex, Dr. Boger worked for over a decade at Merck. Dr. Boger holds a bachelor of arts in Chemistry and Philosophy from Wesleyan University and a master's and doctorate degrees in Chemistry from Harvard University.

About Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Alkeus Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage drug discovery and development company focused on first-in-class compounds to treat serious diseases of the eye. Its lead compound, ALK-001, specifically targets the formation of toxic deposits found in the eyes of patients with Stargardt disease.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
