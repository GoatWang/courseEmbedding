    An upscale, affluent suburb located 18 miles west of downtown Chicago, Hinsdale covers 4.6 square miles and boasts excellent schools, beautiful scenery and a wide array of housing choices. The village is bordered on the east by Western Springs, on the north by Oak Brook, to the west by Westmont and the village of Clarendon Hills, and to the south by Burr Ridge. It has approximately 18,000 residents, and is located in both DuPage and Cook Counties. In 1862, William Robbins, known as the "Father of Hinsdale," bought 640 acres of land in what is now known as Hinsdale. During that time, Robbins planned and built streets, and planted thousands of young shade trees. The official name "Hinsdale" was established in 1873, and during that same year, Hinsdale was incorporated as a village. The population at that time was about 500. Today, Hinsdale's housing sports a wide range of architectural styles including Italianate, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Prairie style, bungalow, Tudor, ranches, and split-level homes. Housing is expensive. For recreation, residents can play soccer, sled or enjoy beautiful open space on more than 220 acres of park land, including the 52-acre Katherine Legge Memorial Park. Hinsdale residents can also attend numerous summer sidewalk sales and art fairs, take out some books from the 30,000 square-foot Hinsdale Public Library, attend classes, workshops and sign up for camp at the Hinsdale Center for the Arts, receive counseling, take classes, and participate in sports leagues at the non-profit Community House, listen to some music at the village's summer concert series, and purchase some produce at the annual farmer's market. Residents and visitors alike can also visit the Frederick Graue House, which was built in 1859, and stands next to Graue Mill, an excellent example of Italianate architecture. The multi-functional facility is now used for special exhibits and programs given by Graue Mill. Downtown Hinsdale at the corner of Washington and First Streets boasts a sophisticated shopping district featuring clothing boutiques, antique shops and a variety of restaurants.  Elementary-age children attend Hinsdale Elementary District 181; the high school district is Hinsdale Township High School District 86. Other notable schools include St. Isaac Jogues Catholic Church School and the First Hinsdale Adventist Academy.« Show less

    An upscale, affluent suburb located 18 miles west of downtown Chicago, Hinsdale covers 4.6 square miles and boasts excellent schools, beautiful scenery and a wide array of housing choices. The village is bordered on the east by Western Springs, on the north by Oak Brook, to the west by Westmont and the village of Clarendon Hills, and to the south by Burr Ridge. It has approximately 18,000 residents, and is located in both DuPage and Cook Counties. In 1862, William Robbins, known as the "Father of Hinsdale," bought 640 acres of land in what is now known as Hinsdale. During that time, Robbins planned and built streets, and planted thousands of young shade trees. The official name "Hinsdale" was established in 1873, and during that same year, Hinsdale was incorporated as a village. The population at that time was about 500. Today, Hinsdale's housing sports a wide range of architectural styles including Italianate, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Prairie style, bungalow, Tudor, ranches, and split-level homes. Housing is expensive. For recreation, residents can play soccer, sled or enjoy beautiful open space on more than 220 acres of park land, including the 52-acre Katherine Legge Memorial Park. Hinsdale residents can also attend numerous summer sidewalk sales and art fairs, take out some books from the 30,000 square-foot Hinsdale Public Library, attend classes, workshops and sign up for camp at the Hinsdale Center for the Arts, receive counseling, take classes, and participate in sports leagues at the non-profit Community House, listen to some music at the village's summer concert series, and purchase some produce at the annual farmer's market. Residents and visitors alike can also visit the Frederick Graue House, which was built in 1859, and stands next to Graue Mill, an excellent example of Italianate architecture. The multi-functional facility is now used for special exhibits and programs given by Graue Mill. Downtown Hinsdale at the corner of Washington and First Streets boasts a sophisticated shopping district featuring clothing boutiques, antique shops and a variety of restaurants.  Elementary-age children attend Hinsdale Elementary District 181; the high school district is Hinsdale Township High School District 86. Other notable schools include St. Isaac Jogues Catholic Church School and the First Hinsdale Adventist Academy.« Show less

    An upscale, affluent suburb located 18 miles west of downtown Chicago, Hinsdale covers 4.6 square miles and boasts excellent schools, beautiful scenery and a wide array of housing choices. The village is bordered on the east by Western Springs, on the north by Oak Brook, to the west by Westmont and the village of Clarendon Hills, and to the south by Burr Ridge. It has approximately 18,000 residents, and is located in both DuPage and Cook Counties. In 1862, William Robbins, known as the "Father of Hinsdale," bought 640 acres of land in what is now known as Hinsdale. During that time, Robbins planned and built streets, and planted thousands of young shade trees. The official name "Hinsdale" was established in 1873, and during that same year, Hinsdale was incorporated as a village. The population at that time was about 500. Today, Hinsdale's housing sports a wide range of architectural styles including Italianate, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Prairie style, bungalow, Tudor, ranches, and split-level homes. Housing is expensive. For recreation, residents can play soccer, sled or enjoy beautiful open space on more than 220 acres of park land, including the 52-acre Katherine Legge Memorial Park. Hinsdale residents can also attend numerous summer sidewalk sales and art fairs, take out some books from the 30,000 square-foot Hinsdale Public Library, attend classes, workshops and sign up for camp at the Hinsdale Center for the Arts, receive counseling, take classes, and participate in sports leagues at the non-profit Community House, listen to some music at the village's summer concert series, and purchase some produce at the annual farmer's market. Residents and visitors alike can also visit the Frederick Graue House, which was built in 1859, and stands next to Graue Mill, an excellent example of Italianate architecture. The multi-functional facility is now used for special exhibits and programs given by Graue Mill. Downtown Hinsdale at the corner of Washington and First Streets boasts a sophisticated shopping district featuring clothing boutiques, antique shops and a variety of restaurants.  Elementary-age children attend Hinsdale Elementary District 181; the high school district is Hinsdale Township High School District 86. Other notable schools include St. Isaac Jogues Catholic Church School and the First Hinsdale Adventist Academy.« Show less

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
