During his tenure he has taken a fledgling Art+Design Department of 32 majors to 100 when he stepped down as Department Chair.One might ask why name the degree Communication Design instead of Graphic Design? The program is crafted to be inclusive of copywriting, integrated marketing design, web design, illustration, and strategic driven creative. This comprehensive look at selling a product, service or idea speaks more to the skills needed in a fluid and ever-changing industry than simply Graphic Design.BIOMichael O'Keefe has worked for five advertising agencies, either as a Senior Art Director or Creative Director. For the last 20 years, he has been servicing his own accounts and has garnished more than 100 local, regional and national awards for creativity.
