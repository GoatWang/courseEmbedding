A freshly vacuum carpet or mopped floor just seems to make the whole room look and feel so much cleaner. From wall-to-wall carpeting to area rugs to bare floors, there are many tools you can use reduce the dust, dirt, grime and other debris that builds up of your floors. Knowing what vacuum cleaners, sweepers, steam cleaners and other devices work for your specific needs lets you keep your floors spic and span. Vacuum Cleaners There are many different types of vacuum cleaners, and each one works best with specific flooring and types of surfaces. Types of vacuum cleaners include uprights, sticks, canisters, robotic, handheld and ones designed specifically for picking up pet hair. An upright is among the most common type of vacuum cleaners. Uprights are ideal because they work on a multitude of flooring types from deep pile carpeting to wood and tile floors. Uprights can be bagged or bagless. Bagged uprights usually have HEPA filters to keep the dust and pollen to a minimum; however, the bag needs replacing periodically. Bagless uprights contain what the vacuum cleaner picks up in a container attached to the vacuum, which empties easily. Stick vacuums are a light version of an upright vacuum cleaner. These types of vacuums are not as powerful as most other kinds but work well on bare floors and are good for low-pile carpeting like area rugs. They are also good for people who have a limited amount of storage space. Canister vacuum cleaners are powerful like uprights but are able clean in narrow spaces like a stick vacuum. These also have bags that must be changed out and often come with some accessories, such as crevice tools and brush attachments ideal for vacuuming upholstered furniture. handheld vacuums are cordless, battery-powered, rechargeable vacuum cleaners ideal for cleaning up small areas like stairs. They're useful for cleaning up quickly when it would be bothersome to bring out a larger vacuum cleaner. Robotic vacuum cleaners are also battery-powered and rechargeable vacuum cleaners, but they clean floors without human assistance. They are usually disc-shaped, meaning they can get under spaces that a normal vacuum cleaner cannot. Pet vacuums can, in most cases, be an upright, canister or stick vacuum cleaner, although there are some robotic and handheld vacuums specifically designed for pet hair. These tend to be powerful vacuum cleaners that can lift pet hair from carpeting and furniture and can keep the pet hair from getting caught in the vacuum cleaner's gearing. carpet cleanersCarpet cleaners use water and detergent to deep clean carpets, removing built-up grime, dirt and stains. Steam cleaners are carpet cleaners that use the hot water extraction method to remove stains and dirt. The hot water sprays onto the carpeting, sometimes with a cleaning solution, and then the steam cleaner sucks the water back up, taking the loosened dirt and other foreign material with it. Regular carpet cleaners follow the same process - only normal temperature water is mixed with a cleaning solution, sprayed onto the carpet, then vacuumed up with the steam cleaner. Most carpet cleaners are like upright vacuum cleaners in style, although there are some canister and portable carpet cleaners available as well. Sweepers and Wet-Dry Vacuum Cleaners Sweepers are an even lighter version of a vacuum cleaner. There typically have a handle that attaches to a base that has a rotating brush to pick up debris and dirt. These are not good for heavy-duty cleaning. Many are push-powered, although there are some that are battery-powered and rechargeable. At the other end of the vacuum spectrum, wet-dry, or shop, vacuum cleaners are powerful vacuum cleaners capable of picking up heavy-duty debris and liquids. These vacuum cleaners are barrel-shaped and come with wide, flexible hoses. These are typically seen in workshops, and are superb at picking up sawdust and metal shavings. Accessories There are numerous accessories available for vacuum cleaners with the most often needed ones being replacement vacuum cleaner bags and filters. As with the air filter on a car, the filters on a vacuum cleaner keep dust and pollen from being spit into the air while the vacuum is in use. Filters are replaceable easily as most just slide in and out from their position in the vacuum cleaner. Each type and brand of vacuum cleaner have specific bags that they use, so consult the owner's manual for your vacuum cleaner before purchasing replacement bags. If you've misplaced your owner's manual, you can usual find one online by searching for the model number of the vacuum. Replacement usually also offer some form of filtration, and some are scented to make the room smell better after using the vacuum cleaner. There are specific cleaning solutions required when using carpet and steam cleaners, and many are made by the manufacturer of the carpet cleaner. Both vacuum cleaners and carpet cleaners sometimes need to have certain parts replaced with belts being a common replacement for vacuum cleaners and pads and brushes being typical replacements for carpet cleaners.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332920, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Microwaves with higher watts deliver faster cooking and more power Commonly available finishes include stainless steel, black and white Look for microwaves with preprogrammed cooking cycles for easy cookingCoffee and Espresso MakersWe carry everything from traditional full-pot brewing systems to single-serve and specialty brew makers that brew coffee, tea and unique coffee drinks.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Help me Locate My Hoover Model Number						



							Like other manufacturers, Hoover lists their product’s identification information on a nameplate sticker. You’ll find this sticker on the bottom or backside of the unit.

Once you’ve found this sticker, you should have no problem finding the model number. Each piece of data on the sticker is labeled, so just search the nameplate for the model number. If it’s not labeled, just look for a series of digits that start with a letter. It could be as simple as F4300 or as long as CH30000 or U2440-900W

If you’re still having a hard time finding this sticker or the model number, give us a call at (866) 802-6383 and we’ll be happy to help you look. 						
 





							Expert Advice on Hoover Vacuums						

							If you’re not an expert on your Hoover product, that’s okay. Because we have enough Hoover experts to satisfy any questions or problem. Our repair resources make it easy to get your tough questions answered and to repair your vacuums.

So the next time you need to purchase a replacement motor for your shoulder vac, a brushroll for your carpet cleaner, or a new light bulb for that little headlight on the front of your vacuum, you can order them from us. And when you get them in the mail, our repair center resource will take you through the steps of dis-assembly and installation. We’re much more than just a spare parts resource.

						Customer Feedback					

						I received the parts for my vacuum cleaner today. They were the right parts and very fast delivery!					

						Huler					




					Hooverin’ 				

					Hoover has become synonymous with the word vacuum, just like Coke has replaced the word soda in many regions. So when you’re “Hoovering” your carpets, it’s important to understand how this iconic brand became the go-to brand for floorcare.

Since their company started over 100 years ago, they have revolutionized  the way we think about cleaning floors. They were the first company to invent an upright vacuum and they made the first portable vacuum cleaner. Hoover customers expect the best out of their vacuums. And that’s why their business is still booming to this day.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
