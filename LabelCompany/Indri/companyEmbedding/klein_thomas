Home » Connect » Press Room Klein Tools Announces Executive Leadership Transitions





August 5, 2014 (Lincolnshire, IL) – Klein Tools, (http://www.kleintools.com) for professionals since 1857, announced today that Mathias Klein III (Mat) will retire as chairman of the board in June, 2015 but will continue to serve on the company’s board of directors. This caps a 46 year career with Klein Tools in which Mat helped transform the company into an innovative manufacturer producing the highest quality hand tools for professional tradesmen in the U.S. and around the world. Upon Mat’s retirement, current president Thomas R. Klein Sr. (Tom) will succeed him as chairman. Additionally, Mark Klein, vice president of domestic sales, and Thomas Klein Jr. (Tom Jr.), general manager of heavy infrastructure, will be promoted and serve as co-presidents of Klein Tools effective January 1, 2015.“Mat will be long remembered for his steadfast commitment to the company,” said Thomas R. Klein Sr. “With his leadership and vision, Klein Tools is in a better position today than when he started years ago.”“Under Tom’s leadership as president, Klein Tools not only survived the recession, it emerged stronger and became the undisputed leader in the hand tool industry,” stated Mathias Klein III chairman of Klein Tools. “His compelling vision ultimately drove Klein to become the world-class manufacturer and new product development machine that it is today. In his new role as chairman, Tom will be in a position to continue to help drive Klein Tools into the future.”During Tom’s tenure as president since 2006, Klein Tools’ manufacturing has moved forward with major investments, including the new Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center and heat treat facilities in Mansfield, Texas. The new product development process has been transformed and is achieving industry-leading results, with major portions of the company’s growth tied to new product introductions. Also under his leadership, the company has achieved significant growth through its focused efforts on international sales and acquisitions in Australia, Mexico and Brazil. In addition, the company has grown with the domestic acquisition of Heritage Cutlery (now Klein Cutlery) and Klein’s joint venture investment with UEI. As chairman, Tom will retain responsibility for finance, legal, corporate development and human resources.As Tom ascends to chairman, Mark Klein will assume the new role of president of sales and marketing and will be responsible for global marketing, sales and customer service. He will also manage the company’s cutlery division in New York, Klein Cutlery and Klein Tools de Mexico affiliates. Thomas Klein Jr., (Tom Jr.) will assume a new role as president of operations and research and development. Tom Jr. will be responsible for Klein Tools’ manufacturing, operations and new product development functions. He will also manage two of the company’s international affiliates, Civitella & Cia in Brazil and Mumme Tools in Australia.Mark Klein was named vice president domestic sales in 2012. He has been leading Klein’s domestic sales operations, including the development of strategic marketing initiatives, such as the company’s launch of the camouflage limited-edition pliers and the “Electrician of the Year” programs in 2013. Klein Tools has achieved double digit sales growth every year since Mark assumed the role of vice president domestic sales. Previously, Mark worked in various capacities developing new or underserved market segments for Klein, including HVAC, hardware, industrial, telecommunications and Canada. In addition, Mark has been accountable for one of the company’s affiliates, Klein Cutlery, which is the largest U.S. manufacturer of hot-forged scissors and shears.Tom Klein Jr. was named general manager of the company’s heavy infrastructure business unit back in 2012. In this role, Tom Jr. has been responsible for the unit’s business functions including product development, sales and marketing. He has also been responsible for the company’s manufacturing activities at the company’s soft goods plant in Ft. Smith, Arkansas. The heavy infrastructure business unit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of more than 13% since Tom Jr. assumed the role of general manager. Prior to that, Tom Jr. worked in product development, primarily developing new products for the power utility market.“Mat and I feel strongly that Mark Klein, Tom Klein Jr. and the entire leadership team are ready for more responsibility to maintain the growth momentum and lead Klein Tools forward.” Thomas R. Klein Sr. continued, “Mark and Tom Jr. have committed to driving the organization forward through continued investment in R&D, people and world-class manufacturing processes, thus we feel now is the time to begin the transition.”From left to right: Thomas R. Klein Jr., Thomas R. Klein Sr., Mathias A. Klein III, and Mark P. Klein# # #Klein is a registered trademark of Klein Tools, Inc.Since 1857 Klein Tools, a family-owned and operated company, has been designing, developing and manufacturing premium-quality, professional-grade hand tools.

Wie soll es weitergehen? Was kann er noch seinen Kindern bieten? Ist er selbst Schuld an seiner Lage? Hätte er alles anders machen sollen?
Diese und viele andere Fragen stellt sich Peter immer und immer wieder. Seine Frau ist seit einem Jahr arbeitslos. Kein Job in Sicht. Das Amt zahlt nicht mehr. Sein Arbeitgeber schreibt schlechte Zahlen. Er hat Angst. Angst vor dem, was da auf ihn zu kommt oder nicht. Es fällt ihm schwer, seinen bisherigen Lebensgrundsatz nicht aus den Augen zu verlieren:

...einfach das Beste draus machen...

3.0 out of 5 starsWhen Longing Leads to VengeanceBySteveAon August 14, 2011Thomas Danforth has spent much of his ninety-plus years seeking his own brand of vengeance. His tale begins in 1939, when he's recruited to provide cover for a fledgling American intelligence operation that will lead to the attempted assassination of a menacing tyrant named Adolf Hitler.The younger Danforth figures to stand squarely with the good guys, but the real world of espionage seems beyond him until he meets a secretive and beautiful young spy-in-training, Anna Klein. The mystery of Anna lures Danforth to break from his pampered life and join her on the dangerous mission within Germany to kill Hitler. It's a thrilling time for Danforth, alone with the girl he believes will give him a more dangerous but fulfilling love and life. Then the attempt fails and Danforth must flee, leaving Anna behind.Danforth must find her. Throughout the war and beyond he embarks on a rabid and marathon quest that costs him nearly all. Anna might have been a double or even triple agent, he learns, and his pursuit takes him to postwar Europe and points East, a grim survey of the tragedies of twentieth-century Europe.As more cruel questions confront Danforth, his search descends into an obsession with extracting vengeance at all costs. People have betrayed him. Could Anna have been at the heart of it all?The best espionage and mystery novels are not about spies and plots and murders but about conflicted souls and the sorry truths they discover about the human condition. Quest offers fine glimpses of that, though the story may stall some readers looking for a fast-paced spy tale. The framed narrative creates many switches in time, the first third can be slow going as Danforth sets up his story, and it carries waves of foreboding and foreshadowing.Sticking with Danforth will reward the reader. The last third moves faster and approaches the quality of espionage masters Le Carré, Furst and McCarry, yet with a profound style all its own. Author Thomas H. Cook knows when it's time to unleash the raw story. He gives you no choice but to follow Danforth as he hurtles on through dark times that threaten to make him far from a savior and just another hopeless victim.This is Cook's first go at an espionage novel. It seems a unique angle for a spy story to have Danforth plow onward like a dogged and self-appointed detective, but it's not unfamiliar territory for Cook, who has had a long and successful career writing crime and mystery novels.The way the story's told might split some opinions, but few can deny the novel's thoughtful and compelling lesson about vengeance.*A longer version of this review ran originally in the Noir Journal blog.*

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA mystery novel for a muture and seasoned readerByMax Readon August 11, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThe "Quest for Anna Klein" was written by Thomas H. Cook. The book is an espionage mystery novel with a historical setting. This is one of several books written by Cook. He received the best novel Edgar for The Chatham School Affair as well as the Martin Beck Award, the Herodotus Prize for best historical short story, and the Barry for best novel for Red Leaves.The writing style is conversational; questions, answers and a tale are woven into alternating time periods - present and past. The prose is rich in structure and salted with moral and philosophical ideology. The setting begins in America and Europe circa 1939 when Germany and Hitler was rising to power.The tale is about one Thomas Jefferson Danforth, son of a well to do importer, living in New York city. Primed by his best friend, Robert Clayton, the unfulfilled and callow young Danforth, gets caught up in a plot of espionage that the conspirators name "the project". As Danforth is progressively drawn in by Clayton, Clayton introduces him to Anna Klein, a spy in training. Needing a location for training Anna Klein, Clayton convinces Danforth to provide his summer house in Connecticut (Winterset) for that purpose.As Danforth observes Anna's training he is slowly and inevitably attracted to her; finally abandoning his current life to follow her to Europe as a co-conspirator in "the project". After arriving in Europe and initially completing some surveilance 'the project' is abandoned and a different more ambitious conspiracy is hatched. Before this new plan can be implemented, a traitor exposes the conspirators. Anna Klein is captured and taken away, Danforth is released.  This begins Danforth's life long quest to find Anna Klein and to reveal and kill the traitor.The tale from here takes many twists and turns and Danforth's steadfast resolve is slowly broken by the truths he invariably discovers: truths that are sometimes stark for "he knew the question had never been whether [he] would live or die, for that had been decided long ago." Danforth's struggle to confront his lost life and find meaning in his quest is brought to the reader as the final pieces of the puzzle are exposed.I thought the book was quite good. I imagine that the prose and style would appeal to a mature and seasoned reader as I would also imagine that a lessor student would find the reading tedious. My knowledge of events, names and places often forming a part of the novel backdrop was not polished and I felt I missed some of the historical drama the author intended. However, I felt that if you have the steadfastness to read the entire novel, you should not be disappointed. I found at least one instance where I had to go back and reread a passage as the linkage (a 100 pages or so) between a name [Kulli Demir]and the character was lost to me. There was also one mystery that seemed to leave an open question....why did Alma give Paul the neckless?All and all I would recommend this novel be added to your reading list.99 comments|
