East West Bank branch in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco.


East West Bank (traditional Chinese: 華美銀行; simplified Chinese: 华美银行; pinyin: Huáměi Yínháng), the primary subsidiary of East West Bancorp, Inc., is a bank based in Pasadena, California.[1] It was founded in 1973 to serve the Chinese American community and has over 130 branch locations in the U.S and Greater China, including branches in northern and southern California, Georgia, Nevada, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Washington.[1] In Greater China, East West’s presence includes 5 full service branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen, and representative offices in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Taipei and Xiamen.[1]
The Chinese name is not a direct translation of east and west, rather it is two characters, which depend on context. 華 can mean magnificent or splendid, but is often used in conjunction with other characters to refer to China and Chinese overseas. Likewise 美 can mean 'pretty' or 'USA, American'.[2]

In 1973, East West Federal Bank (now East West Bank) was founded by F. Chow Chan, Betty Tom Chu, Richard K. Quan, Gilbert L. Leong, Philip Chow, John A Nuccio, Christopher L. Pocino, and John M. Lee.[3] Its focus was to serve the Chinese American community in Southern California.
In 1991, during the savings and loan crisis, the company acquired Pacific Coast Savings, which increased its assets from $600 million to $1 billion and expanded operations to San Francisco, California.[2]
By 1992, the bank had $1.4 billion in assets.[3]
In 1992, Dominic Ng was named the Chairman, CEO and President of the company, replacing Kellogg Chan who retired.[3]
It became a state-chartered commercial bank on July 31, 1995.[4]
In 1999, the company acquired First Central Bank for $13.5 million in cash.[5]

East West Bank branch in the Chinatown neighborhood of San Francisco.


East West Bank (traditional Chinese: 華美銀行; simplified Chinese: 华美银行; pinyin: Huáměi Yínháng), the primary subsidiary of East West Bancorp, Inc., is a bank based in Pasadena, California.[1] It was founded in 1973 to serve the Chinese American community and has over 130 branch locations in the U.S and Greater China, including branches in northern and southern California, Georgia, Nevada, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Washington.[1] In Greater China, East West’s presence includes 5 full service branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen, and representative offices in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Taipei and Xiamen.[1]
The Chinese name is not a direct translation of east and west, rather it is two characters, which depend on context. 華 can mean magnificent or splendid, but is often used in conjunction with other characters to refer to China and Chinese overseas. Likewise 美 can mean 'pretty' or 'USA, American'.[2]

History[edit]




East West Bank in Chinatown, Houston


In 1973, East West Federal Bank (now East West Bank) was founded by F. Chow Chan, Betty Tom Chu, Richard K. Quan, Gilbert L. Leong, Philip Chow, John A Nuccio, Christopher L. Pocino, and John M. Lee.[3] Its focus was to serve the Chinese American community in Southern California.
In 1991, during the savings and loan crisis, the company acquired Pacific Coast Savings, which increased its assets from $600 million to $1 billion and expanded operations to San Francisco, California.[2]
By 1992, the bank had $1.4 billion in assets.[3]
In 1992, Dominic Ng was named the Chairman, CEO and President of the company, replacing Kellogg Chan who retired.[3]
It became a state-chartered commercial bank on July 31, 1995.[4]
In 1999, the company acquired First Central Bank for $13.5 million in cash.[5]
In August 2004, the company acquired Trust Bank, a Chinese American bank based in Monterey Park, California with 4 branches and $235 million in assets, for $32.9 million.[6][7]
In September 2005, the company acquired United National Bank, a commercial bank headquartered in San Marino, California with 11 branches and $665 million in loans receivable, for $177.9 million.[2][8]
In March 2006, the company acquired Standard Bank, a Chinese-American bank headquartered in Monterey Park, California with 6 branches and $923 million in assets, for $200 million.[8][9][10]
In August 2007, the company acquired Desert Community Bank, a community bank operating in the Victor Valley region of California. Desert Community Bank branches remain branded as such and did not change to East West Bank.[11]
In 2009, the company acquired the assets of United Commercial Bank (UCB), via a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. This expanded East West Bank's reach by 63 branches, including 17 in Southern California, and branches in the Chinese American communities of Houston, Boston, and Atlanta, as well as branches in Hong Kong and China.[12][13][14]
In January 2010, Irene H. Oh was promoted to EVP and CFO, replacing Thomas J. Tolda, who resigned.[15]
In 2010, the company acquired the assets, including 4 branches, of Washington First International Bank of Seattle, Washington, via a transaction facilitated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[16][17][18][19]
In 2014, the company acquired MetroCorp Bancshares, which operated MetroBank, for $268 million in cash and stock.[20][21]
In October 2016, Gregory L. Guyett was appointed as the President and COO of the company.[22]
Sponsors and endorsements[edit]
The bank's spokeswoman was figure skater Michelle Kwan.[23]
East West Bank purchased the naming rights to the East West Ice Palace, an ice rink arena in Artesia, California.[23]
East West Bancorp was the sponsor of the 2007 East West Bank Classic, a tennis tournament on the Women's Tennis Association Tour.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

§ Monthly payment shown is equal to the purchase price (excluding taxes and delivery) divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded to the next highest whole dollar, and only applies to the selected financing option shown. If you make your payments by the due date each month, the monthly payment shown should allow you to pay off this purchase within the promo period if this balance is the only balance on your account during the promo period.
