Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index (FUMTR) is developed and owned by ISE and is designed to take advantage of both event-driven news and long term trends in the natural gas industry. Equity securities are selected for inclusion in the Index using a quantitative ranking and screening system that begins with the universe of equity securities of issuers that are involved in the exploration and production of natural gas and that satisfy market capitalization, liquidity and weighting concentration requirements. After the screens are applied, the remaining equity securities are divided into equity securities issued by MLPs and equity securities issued by non-MLPs, allocated to the Index 15% and 85%, respectively. The Index uses a linear-based capitalization-weighted methodology to rank the equity securities. One cannot directly invest in an Index. bi>

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

                Private equity giant buys EagleClaw Midstream for $2 billion
            



                Permian gas output is climbing with crude oil production
            



The oil boom in the Permian Basin, America’s most prolific crude play, has become a gas boom.







                        The most important market news of the day.

With its $2 billion takeover of EagleClaw Midstream Ventures LLC, Blackstone Group LP on Monday became the latest company to bet on natural gas in a basin better known for its oil reserves. Its interest lies in “associated gas” -- a term used to describe fuel that comes out of an oil well along with the crude. Gas volumes will rise fivefold in five years on the EagleClaw system, said David Foley, chief executive officer of Blackstone Energy Partners LP.Gas output from the Permian, which accounts for more than a quarter of America’s oil production, has risen to a record every month this year, government data show, spurring deals in the region. In just the past three months, Targa Resources Corp. took over gas pipelines in the Permian from Outrigger Energy and Western Gas Partners LP exchanged assets for a stake in a gas-gathering system there.




Drilling for Permian oil is covering a bigger area and moving south, boosting gas volumes, Foley said.“We’ve got beachfront property, basically,” Foley said by phone. “And the beach is continuing to extend. We’ve already got, existing or under construction, three-quarters of a billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity” for gas.The Permian has more than just booming production going for it. Blackstone says it’s targeting the play because supplies there are linked to global prices. In contrast, natural gas prices in eastern U.S. basins, such as the Marcellus shale, have been weighed down by a regional glut of supply.




Easy ExportsPermian gas may be easily exported to Mexico via pipeline and as liquefied natural gas from terminals on the Gulf of Mexico, Foley said. Texas gas also sells at less of a discount to the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana, compared with Marcellus supplies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Export is the single biggest source of growth in natural gas demand in the U.S.,” he said, “and this asset is next door.”




Kinder Morgan Inc. is taking non-binding bids through April 20 for as much as 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of new capacity on its proposed 430-mile (692-kilometer) Gulf Coast Express Pipeline from the Permian, company spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz said by phone Tuesday. DCP Midstream LP agreed to participate in the project, the companies announced last week. Terms weren’t disclosed.Deliveries would arrive at Agua Dulce, Texas, which is emerging as an export trading hub because of connections to cross-border pipelines and gas liquefaction projects, Sheetal Nasta, an analyst at RBN Energy LLC, wrote in a Feb. 9 research note.

Blackstone has invested extensively in energy since the late 1990s, raising $7.4 billion since 2011 for two funds focusing on the segment. Its bigger energy investments include a joint venture with Cheniere Energy Inc. in Louisiana to export liquefied natural gas and a deepwater drilling project in the Gulf of Mexico.Through the end of last year, Blackstone’s first energy fund, a $2.4 billion vehicle that began investing in 2011, had delivered a 13 percent annualized return after fees, according to a company report. The second fund, which closed in early 2015 and which had deployed less than 13 percent of its $5 billion, had posted a 36 percent annualized return on invested capital.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index (FUMTR) is developed and owned by ISE and is designed to take advantage of both event-driven news and long term trends in the natural gas industry. Equity securities are selected for inclusion in the Index using a quantitative ranking and screening system that begins with the universe of equity securities of issuers that are involved in the exploration and production of natural gas and that satisfy market capitalization, liquidity and weighting concentration requirements. After the screens are applied, the remaining equity securities are divided into equity securities issued by MLPs and equity securities issued by non-MLPs, allocated to the Index 15% and 85%, respectively. The Index uses a linear-based capitalization-weighted methodology to rank the equity securities. One cannot directly invest in an Index. bi>

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
