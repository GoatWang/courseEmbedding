REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Amaya, through certain of its subsidiaries, is licensed or  approved to offer, or offers under third party licenses or approvals, its  products and services in various jurisdictions throughout the world, including  the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, Estonia, Belgium, Denmark, Bulgaria,  Greece, Ireland, Romania, the Isle of Man, Malta, Portugal, the State of  Schleswig-Holstein in Germany, the  Czech Republic and the State of New Jersey in the United  States.
Amaya's primary market is the European Union (EU) and it  currently operates some or all of its online gaming verticals in various EU  jurisdictions through national licenses or approvals. Additionally, Rational  Group's subsidiaries that hold Malta licenses use the same to offer some or all  of its online gaming verticals to residents in EU member states in compliance  with established EU rules and principles on the free movement of services.  Amaya believes there is an ongoing trend for EU member states to establish  national regulatory, licensing and taxation systems for online gaming,  including, but not limited to, poker, casino, sportsbetting or a combination  thereof. According to the European Commission, all national regulatory systems  for online gaming must comply with applicable EU principles. Amaya intends  to seek licensure in more EU member states if and when such member states  introduce their own national regulatory and licensing systems.
Outside the EU, the licenses and approvals granted to Amaya  subsidiaries by the applicable gaming authorities in the Isle of Man and Malta  generally permit the applicable entity to operate and accept customers in  various jurisdictions around the world where no national regulatory and licensing  system specifically requires licensure by foreign operators. Amaya anticipates  there is a potential for national regulation of online gaming outside the EU  and that this may result in potential licensing or partnerships with private  operators in various jurisdictions. 
With respect to online gaming, Amaya supports regulation, including licensing  and taxation regimes, which it believes will promote sustainable online gaming  markets that are beneficial for consumers, governments and the citizens of the  regulating jurisdiction, operators, and the industry as a whole. Amaya strives  to work with applicable governmental authorities to develop regulations that it  expects would protect consumers, encourage responsible gaming, ensure efficient  taxation and promote regulated gameplay. Amaya also strives to be among the  first of the licensed operators in newly regulated jurisdictions, in each case  to the extent it would be in furtherance of its business goals and strategy and  in compliance with its policies and procedures with respect to the same. In  addition, Amaya otherwise seeks to ensure that it obtains all permits,  authorizations, registrations or licenses necessary to develop, distribute and  offer its products and services in the jurisdictions in which it carries on  business globally and where it is otherwise required to do so.
Amaya's Compliance Committee is responsible for the oversight of gaming  regulatory and other corporate compliance matters. Additional information about  the Compliance Committee, including its members, can be found here.

Amaya Inc. (also known as Amaya Gaming and Amaya Gaming Group) is a Canadian gaming and online gambling company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol TSX: AYA) and headquartered in suburban Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In June 2014, Amaya agreed to buy the parent company of PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker, owned by Isai and Mark Scheinberg, for $4.9 billion[1][2] The takeover makes Amaya the world's biggest publicly listed online gambling company.[3] The deal was closed on August 1, 2014.[4]
The company produces gaming products and services including online casino, poker, sportsbook, platform, lotteries and slot machines software.[citation needed] It claims some of the world’s largest gaming operators and casinos are powered by its online, mobile, and land-based products.[citation needed] The company has offices in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.[5][full citation needed]
In March 2016, the company's CEO, David Baazov, was charged by Canadian regulators with multiple securities fraud charges.[6] Baazov took an indefinite leave of absence shortely thereafter,[7] and resigned in August.[8] On December 20, 2016, Baazov dropped a bid to buy the company with a "virtually unknown" group of outside investors, one of whom denied being involved.[9]
On 12 May 2017, it was announced that the company would change its name to The Stars Group Inc. and relocate its headquarters to Toronto.[10]

Imagine a day in which you were outside and the sky was so filled with clouds that the sun was hidden behind them. Then, the clouds thinned and the sun shone through. 
Remember how you felt in that moment. The goal of yoga is that you feel this way all the time; this is svaroopa – your own divine essence.  This is amaya – the end of limitation. Even when hidden by the multitude of clouds, the sun is always there. The same is true of your own divine essence – it is always there. 


The goal of the Amaya® line of products is to dissolve those clouds in yourself so that you may enjoy the radiant divine light hidden within.

AMAYA Gaming: Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner! - Amaya Inc. (NASDAQ:AYA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AMAYA Gaming: Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner!Jul.28.15 | About: Amaya Inc. (AYA) Étienne Bouchard Top-down, portfolio strategy, macro, GrowthSummary30% upside for one of Canada's most attractive growth opportunities, buy now before it's too late.The world's largest online gambling website operator (70% of the online poker market).Corporate strategy that will deliver double-digit revenue growth for years to come.Great macroeconomic exposure in a rapidly expanding industry.Amaya inc. (NASDAQ:AYA), a brief introduction
Headquartered in Pointe-Claire, Québec, Amaya, according to the company's Website, "is a leading provider of technology-based solutions, products and services in the global gaming and interactive entertainment industries." When David Baazov founded the company in 2004, the main segment of operations was Business-to-Business (B2B). They were a software provider for lottery gaming and land-based gaming operations (casinos). This was the main business segment prior to the acquisitions made sequentially becoming quoted on the TSX. On July 2010, Amaya Gaming Group inc. went public on the TSX Venture exchange. In 2013 it was graduated to the much larger Canadian exchange, the TSX. On August 1st 2014 they acquired Oldford Group for $CAD 4.9 billion, the holding company of Rational Group. This acquisition completely changed the company's corporate strategy (which will be discussed in much more detail below). As of June 8th, the company also traded on the NASDAQ.
My interest was sparked as the company began a shift towards becoming a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) provider of online and mobile gaming services. As of July 8th 2015, Amaya is the world's largest publicly traded real money online gaming company, accountable for approximately 70% of the global online poker market and over 150 billion hands of online poker! The following analysis will take an in-depth look at Amaya's strategy, operating environment as well as valuation. I am recommending a strong buy on a company that is fairly valued, offers exciting revenue growth opportunities as well as holding a competitive economic moat in a rapidly growing industry.


Source: Stock Charts
Corporate growth strategies and Segmented operations:
The company's corporate strategy is fairly simple, be the biggest, most efficient online gambling (not only poker) operator in the World. As they acquired the likes of Pokerstars and Full-Tilt Poker, Amaya became the world`s largest poker site. They represent approximately 70% of the market, with Pokerstars alone representing a bit above 60%, of the global online poker market, as can be seen below. Also provided below is the revenue breakdown of Amaya and their main competitors. The pie chart examined below shows just how impressive Amaya's market power is. We could almost qualify Amaya as being a monopoly in the online cash-game poker industry.


Source: Amaya Investor Presentation
Their reliance on a single product is very clear, and is one of the reasons why management is looking to diversify its vertical markets. In the Q1 MD&A document, management emphasizes that they have begun the process of developing their current online platforms in order for them to generate approximately 13% of their revenues from casino and sports books. In 2014 they launched an online casino product, as a test run. In the same year, Amaya conducted a survey which revealed that 40-50% of their active users have iGaming (iGaming and online gambling are interchangeable nouns) accounts on other platforms in order to access different segments. This cross-selling opportunity will undoubtedly help top-line growth, but even more so the bottom-line as platforms are for the most part already developed. I am personally very skeptical of surveys, but, there is no doubt that these markets exist. Indeed, by looking at the competition (see graph below), they all offer a diversified portfolio of products.



Source: Amaya Investor Presentation
The fact that Amaya had 99% of total revenues from poker in 2014 (approximately 95% in Q1 of 2015) would be cause for concern if not for the strength of their brands and platforms. I believe that going forward diversification to their revenue streams can only be beneficial for the company, albeit they are able to maintain the very high operating margins they have been accustomed to. Other than getting money from more pockets, the diversification into the sports books and casino segments is very beneficial for geographic diversification. With approximately 60% of revenues coming from the EU, the launch of sports book and daily fantasy betting will undoubtedly increase U.S. revenues. The fact of the matter is, online gambling (whether it be poker, bingo, sports, casino ... you name it) is still illegal in the majority of the U.S. To help visualize the situation, here is a map that was neatly put together by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).

Source: CEI
There are a total of three States that online gambling is explicitly legal in; New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware. While this may seem bleak, an interesting aspect of the U.S. market is that while online gambling is widely banned, play money poker is a very common past-time. Party Poker and Full-Tilt Poker rose to fame in North-America by offering a free online poker game. The two brands possess approximately 80% of the market share of the free services, many of which are players who would participate in money games if not for it being illegal. Considering Amaya is launching Pokerstars in New Jersey in Q3 of 2015, we expect revenues from the U.S. to slowly ramp up. If we consider that some states are pushing forward with legislative reforms to allow online gambling, the opportunities in the U.S. could be even more substantial for Amaya.

The main strategic theme that managers are expressing is to diversify into more vertical markets, as expressed above. That being said, I believe, and so does management, that Poker must remain Amaya's core competency. Amaya states that they aim at doubling their Poker revenues in the next five years. They plan on doing this through the use of superstar brand ambassadors like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar Jr. as well as producing and promoting international live poker tours and events (EPT, LAPT, APPT). They plan on increasing exposure to emerging markets, mainly in South-America and Asia. The entry into the U.S. market in 2015 will also help drive revenue growth as poker is set to be the fastest growing segment of the iGaming industry, as shown below.

Source: Amaya Investor Relations
Before concluding on the strategy section, I think it's important to have a quick side note on the legal issues the firm has faced since the end of 2014. Amaya has been under investigation by the AMF as of December, without any formal accusations made (for more info. click hyperlink above). While being a legitimate threat to the company, I believe it is overly emphasized by investors. The reason why I say this is because the company has a Compliance Committee in place which will safeguard the company follows on track with their strategy without prosecution. Here are some of the notable individuals on the committee: Ben Soave (former Chief Superintendent to the RCMP), Harlan Goodson (former Director of California's Division of Gambling Control) and Tom Auriemma (Former chair of the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement). The committee is there to insure that the business model Amaya has is sustainable and ethical going forward.

Lastly, the company has proven their commitment on the more profitable B2C segment by divesting B2B assets. On March 26th 2015, Innova Gaming Group Inc. filed a preliminary prospectus in connection to a proposed IPO. Innova was a wholly owned subsidiary of Amaya's. Amaya received gross proceeds of $CAD 34.1 million while maintaining approximately 40% ownership (could be reduced to 31% if underwriters exercise options). Most recently, on March 30th of 2015 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell 100% of the outstanding shares of Amaya Americas Corporation, the parent company of Cadillac Jack inc., for approximately $CAD 476 million. The message is clear, and Amaya is heavily focused on building a leader in the B2C segment of the iGaming industry.
All-in-all, I believe the strategy going forward is very ambitious, yet attainable. I'm convinced the significant growth opportunities presented above will be achieved by the competent management group at Amaya.
Top-down investment thesis:
As some of you might know, I'm a very top-down oriented investor and I don't necessarily love stock picking (OK, I do, but it's not my cup of tea). A few weeks ago I posted an article showing why I believe that Information Technology stocks, more precisely the IT Services and Software sub-sector would outperform the broader TSX Composite Index. While I did not focus on the iGaming sub-sector, I do recognize that they share very similar traits. First of all, it is outgrowing the larger economy and most other industries.
According to IBIS industry reports the Global Casinos & Online Gambling industry (March 2015) is still in its growth phase. From the years 2007 to 2015, revenues for the industry grew at a CAGR of 4.46%. They forecast that for the years 2015-2020 the industry will grow at a CAGR of 5.07%. Supporting this hefty growth rate is the emergence of casinos and online gambling in Asia, mainly in Macau and Singapore (hyperlinks are two interesting articles on the casino and gambling industry in the mentioned geographies). As growth picks up in the coming years, they also cite progressive legislation in the U.S. and Japan as strongly beneficial. Another interesting aspect of the report explains that the five years leading to 2015, the number of enterprises in the industry grew at approximately 2%, less than half of revenue. This suggests that the industry grew organically, and less through the emergence of new competition. This is beneficial for those already operating in the sector.


The data described above from the IBIS report is a combination of brick-and-mortar casinos and iGaming platforms. They are grouped as one industry as they cater to a similar consumer. That being said, the ease of access to the internet is much greater to that of brick-and-mortar casinos globally. As a young adult with a certain interest in sports books and poker, I am much more enticed with the opportunity to spoil my gambling vice on my tablet or computer then to visit a casino. While this may not be true for high-rollers and baby boomers, I feel the long-term industry trend is leaning towards more flexible and cheaper online alternatives. When I say cheaper, I meant for me the consumer. I could also have meant that the capital required to operate an online gambling venture is much less than that of a casino, ie: a server and domain vs PPE and a significant amount of labour costs. Hence, this why I believe that the growth mentioned above is potentially understating revenue growth for iGaming in itself.
A second strong theme is the favourable macroeconomic exposure the company has; most notably to the European consumer (≈60% of revenues). As I love economics, let me bust out a couple of indicators I feel support the theory of a recovering EU economy and consumer. First of all, the Unemployment rate is trending downwards. The last two months it was reported at 11.10%, with the EU28 at 9.6% (lowest since July 2011). Considering wage growth has been positive on a YoY basis since the beginning of 2015 (2.2% in March), it is fair to say that the labour market is improving.


Source: Trading Economics
Consumer spending hit a record high in the Euro Area in Q1 of 2015 at 1349.78 billion € . I feel that consumer spending is set to continue rising as favorable lending rates will encourage borrowing and increasing credit. QE is set to continue for the duration of 2015, putting unremitting pressure on interest and loan rates. I would mention that consumer sentiment is approaching 10 year highs, that being said this is a measure of optimism based off a phone survey, so I don't consider it valid data (phone surveys are even more ridiculous then written ones if you ask me).
 
Source: Trading Economics
While this top-down point of view is what brought me to analyzing Amaya, the fundamentals as well as the cash-flow analysis that are presented below are what transformed my interest into a solid buy recommendation.
Fundamentals Analysis:
As it is, Amaya has a very large economic moat in the online poker industry. This advantage is the basis for why this company is so attractive. Amaya's strong valuable brand equity, as well as its sheer size will allow it to ensure long-term profits and market share in the iGaming industry. The fact that financials are average at best is less important to me then the competitive advantage they have in the industry. Let's not forget Amaya's B2C business model only started in 2014. The more Amaya grows and diversifies, the more the barriers to entry increases for firms attempting to take a share of the pie.

Amaya's assets are primarily centered around goodwill and intangible assets. The biggest two components of this branch are goodwill and customer relationships. The problem I have with this is that this value seems very bias, unless customer relationships come in the form of contracts and ensured future cash-flows. The balance sheet does indicate significant leverage (3.34 billion $CAD in long-term debt) as Amaya has a D/E ratio of approximately 2.25 as of Q1 2015. The high levels of LT-debt arose following the acquisition of the Oldford Group. Fortunately, with 371.65 million $CAD in cash on hand, Amaya has no problem with meeting short term interest payments. I believe the company is highly leveraged, but shouldn't be seen as a threat to solvency; although it may slow further acquisition processes.
The balance sheet isn't all that impressive, but the income statement screams growth. With the help of the Oldford Group acquisition, Amaya experienced 345.17% revenue growth in 2014. Yes, this is the result of an acquisition; thus essential to mention that the company has been growing at a CAGR of 159.04% over the past 5 years. If not had been for the loss on discontinued operations (Cadillac Jack and Innova) Amaya would have made their first profits in the year ending Dec. 31 2014. In Q1 of 2015 the company reported a net profit of 12.96 million $CAD, an EPS of $0.10. While profits were realized in Q1, losses on discontinued operations remained; they had a loss of 9.4 million $CAD. These losses have been decreasing over the past two quarters and I look for them to disappear by the end of 2015, at latest Q1 2016. EPS and net income growth are forecasted to see significant growth in the coming 6-12 months.
Amaya's margins are better then its competitors (in parentheses); Profit, EBITDA and operating margin were 3.81% (-0.63%), 36.09% (21.2%) and 22.09% (15.75%) respectively. It is important to note that this doesn't only compare with online providers like bwin and 888, but also with competing casino operators such as Las Vegas Sands. Company and industry data are from Ycharts.


As I mentioned previously, Amaya is a growth opportunity. Amaya doesn't offer dividends and it has a very rudimentary share buy-back plan (maximum of 5% was allowed by the TSX on Feb. 13, 2015). Thankfully, it offers great value considering its growth potential.
DCF Valuation model:
Amaya currently sits at a TTM P/E of 144.4 (this is considering the very small bottom line). The 1-yr forward P/E is slated to lower to 12 according to Morningstar, much lower than industry averages domestically and internationally. I have put together a DCF model that reflects my optimism in the company while setting realistic assumptions going forward. Please see the table below:

In brief, my growth assumptions are a tad below those of the company. They expect to double poker revenues by 2020, which would equate to approximately $CAD 2 billion. They also plan on having other vertical markets (casino, sportsbooks, etc.) representing 13% as soon as next year. I'm convinced that by 2020 it should be approximately 20% considering it is a less saturated revenue stream for the company. To recapitulate the latter statements, what this would mean is that the company expects revenues of approximately 2.5 billion $CAD by 2020. Using my forecasts I have a terminal year EBIT of 1.2 billion $CAD, which is derived from sales of approximately 2.3 billion $CAD. Using a WACC of 9.6% I end up with a PV of cash-flows of 2.37 billion $CAD.

Other notable assumptions: SG&A is set to decrease from approximately 55% of sales to 40% of sales by 2020, the risk free-rate used in the WACC is the Canadian 10-yr bond yield at 2.2%, the equity risk premium (5.75%) was derived from Aswath Damodarans yearly premium list and lastly I added a legal and entry risk premium of 2.5%.
With a cumulative PV of FCF of $CAD 2.4 billion and an exit multiple of 12.0x EV/EBIT (calculated using the approximate TTM EV/EBIT of the industry) we get an EV of 11.51 billion and an equity value of 5.88 billion $CAD. This gives me an implied target price of 42.64 $CAD, and a price appreciation of 34.3%.
I'm new to DCF's, spending most of my time on economics and sector based research. I'd be glad to hear your comments and critiques of my model; for any questions on assumptions and structure feel free to message me through Seeking Alpha.
Conclusion
Amaya is the largest operator of online gambling websites in the world, with a heavy focus on poker. It operates in a growing industry and has exposure to favorable macroeconomic conditions. In Amaya, you are you purchasing shares of a company that is set to continue to grow revenues in the double digits for at least 4 years to come (without any further acquisitions). Management has established structured growth strategies that will complement the already existing economic moat of the company. With a target price of 42.64 $CAD (32.83 $USD), I believe that Amaya is undervalued at this time, and is thus a strong buy.
Morningstar Broker Analyst Rating: 4.7/5
Nasdaq 1-yr target: 38.45 $USD (49.93 $CAD)
Desjardins rating: Buy, target of 47 $CAD as of July 1st.
Dundee Securities: Buy
