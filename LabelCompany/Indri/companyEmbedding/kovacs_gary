Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Early life[edit]
Kovacs was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Ruby (né Kiraly) and Janos (John) Kovacs. Kovacs's father was a Hungarian refugee who fled to Canada in 1956.[6]
Kovacs attended the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business, earning a BComm in 1990 and an MBA in 1999.[7]
Career[edit]





This biographical section is written like a résumé. Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. (September 2015)


Kovacs spent more than 25 years in software and mobile technology. In addition to his undergraduate and graduate business degrees, Kovacs is a certified communications electronics technologist.[8]
Kovacs joined IBM in 1990, where he held leadership positions in product management, sales, marketing, and operations, eventually serving as Worldwide Program Director for the software division, based in New York.[9][10]
After 10 years at IBM, Kovacs became President of Zi Corporation, a company that pioneered predictive text, among other mobile search and text input solutions.[11][12] From 2000 to 2003, he helmed the company’s successful creation and growth and provided strategic direction for its worldwide expansion.[13]
Kovacs moved to Macromedia in 2003, working as Vice President of Product Marketing. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, Kovacs became Vice President and General Manager of Product Management and Marketing for Adobe’s mobile and devices division,[14] rising to General Manager of the entire division in 2008.[15]
From 2009 to 2010, Kovacs served as Senior Vice President of Markets, Solutions, and Products at Sybase, through its acquisition by SAP.[16]
After an extensive search for a new CEO in 2010, Mozilla selected Kovacs to replace former CEO John Lilly. Kovacs led the overall direction of the organization and the Firefox web browser.[17]
During Kovacs' tenure Mozilla expanded into the mobile market with the launch of Firefox OS, its open mobile operating system.[18] Kovacs previewed Firefox OS at Mobile World Congress 2013, garnering commitments from 18 major worldwide mobile operators.[19]
In 2012, Kovacs negotiated a reported $1 billion deal renewing Mozilla’s agreement to make Google the default search engine in Firefox.[20]
Kovacs also steered Mozilla to a position as industry leader in Internet privacy initiatives. Most notably, Firefox now offers Collusion, an add-on that enables users to view all third parties tracking their online activity, and in turn, to make more informed decisions about being tracked.[21] The Ponemon Institute named Mozilla the “Most Trusted Internet Company For Privacy” for 2012.[22]
Kovacs is a frequent public speaker and panel member. His 2012 TED talk "Tracking the Trackers" explores issues of Internet privacy in an increasingly connected world.[23] At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012, he presented on strategies for creating a resilient cyber economy amid economic, security, and privacy obstacles.[24] He was a keynote speaker at the Mobile World Congress 2013.[25]
Fierce Wireless named Kovacs one of the Rising Stars in Wireless for 2013.[26]
On April 2013 Mozilla announced that he would step down as CEO of the corporation later that year[27] and until March 2014 he was part of Mozilla's board of directors.[28]
On July 30, 2013, Kovacs joined[29] AVG Technologies as CEO. In September 2016, AVG Technologies was acquired by Avast Software [30] Kovacs was terminated [31] from AVG Technologies in December 2016.
Personal life[edit]
Raised by Hungarian parents in Toronto, Kovacs began experimenting with technology at a young age. Though grateful for the opportunities and education provided by his native Canada, his interest in innovation drew him to the San Francisco Bay Area.[32]
He now lives in Piedmont, California.[33]

Early life[edit]
Kovacs was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Ruby (né Kiraly) and Janos (John) Kovacs. Kovacs's father was a Hungarian refugee who fled to Canada in 1956.[6]
Kovacs attended the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business, earning a BComm in 1990 and an MBA in 1999.[7]
Career[edit]





This biographical section is written like a résumé. Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. (September 2015)


Kovacs spent more than 25 years in software and mobile technology. In addition to his undergraduate and graduate business degrees, Kovacs is a certified communications electronics technologist.[8]
Kovacs joined IBM in 1990, where he held leadership positions in product management, sales, marketing, and operations, eventually serving as Worldwide Program Director for the software division, based in New York.[9][10]
After 10 years at IBM, Kovacs became President of Zi Corporation, a company that pioneered predictive text, among other mobile search and text input solutions.[11][12] From 2000 to 2003, he helmed the company’s successful creation and growth and provided strategic direction for its worldwide expansion.[13]
Kovacs moved to Macromedia in 2003, working as Vice President of Product Marketing. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, Kovacs became Vice President and General Manager of Product Management and Marketing for Adobe’s mobile and devices division,[14] rising to General Manager of the entire division in 2008.[15]
From 2009 to 2010, Kovacs served as Senior Vice President of Markets, Solutions, and Products at Sybase, through its acquisition by SAP.[16]
After an extensive search for a new CEO in 2010, Mozilla selected Kovacs to replace former CEO John Lilly. Kovacs led the overall direction of the organization and the Firefox web browser.[17]
During Kovacs' tenure Mozilla expanded into the mobile market with the launch of Firefox OS, its open mobile operating system.[18] Kovacs previewed Firefox OS at Mobile World Congress 2013, garnering commitments from 18 major worldwide mobile operators.[19]
In 2012, Kovacs negotiated a reported $1 billion deal renewing Mozilla’s agreement to make Google the default search engine in Firefox.[20]
Kovacs also steered Mozilla to a position as industry leader in Internet privacy initiatives. Most notably, Firefox now offers Collusion, an add-on that enables users to view all third parties tracking their online activity, and in turn, to make more informed decisions about being tracked.[21] The Ponemon Institute named Mozilla the “Most Trusted Internet Company For Privacy” for 2012.[22]
Kovacs is a frequent public speaker and panel member. His 2012 TED talk "Tracking the Trackers" explores issues of Internet privacy in an increasingly connected world.[23] At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012, he presented on strategies for creating a resilient cyber economy amid economic, security, and privacy obstacles.[24] He was a keynote speaker at the Mobile World Congress 2013.[25]
Fierce Wireless named Kovacs one of the Rising Stars in Wireless for 2013.[26]
On April 2013 Mozilla announced that he would step down as CEO of the corporation later that year[27] and until March 2014 he was part of Mozilla's board of directors.[28]
On July 30, 2013, Kovacs joined[29] AVG Technologies as CEO. In September 2016, AVG Technologies was acquired by Avast Software [30] Kovacs was terminated [31] from AVG Technologies in December 2016.
Personal life[edit]
Raised by Hungarian parents in Toronto, Kovacs began experimenting with technology at a young age. Though grateful for the opportunities and education provided by his native Canada, his interest in innovation drew him to the San Francisco Bay Area.[32]
He now lives in Piedmont, California.[33]

Good day and welcome to the Q3 2015 AVG Technologies Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Bonnie McBride. Please go ahead.
Bonnie McBride - Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today for AVG's third quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Joining me today from management are Gary Kovacs, AVG's Chief Executive Officer, and John Little, the company's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call is being webcast and recorded. A replay of both will be made available shortly after the conclusion of this call.
On today's call, we will provide you with details about our performance in the third quarter of 2015. Some of our comments may include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding our outlook for 2015. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release and read the Risk Factors in our filings with the SEC, including our 20-F filed on April 10, 2015.
I would also like to note that the results reported today include certain non-GAAP financial measures and that the numbers discussed on this call will be non-GAAP unless stated (1:21). We provide non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they are the most valuable way to review our core operating results. We have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release, which is available on our website and which has also been filed with the SEC.
The forward-looking statements and risks stated on this conference call are based on current expectations as of today and AVG assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Kovacs.
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Thank you, Bonnie, and good afternoon, everyone. First of all, thank you for joining us today as we report our Q3 quarterly results. And on today's call, as is typical, I will provide an overview of the quarter and a particular focus on the strategic accomplishments behind the results. I will then turn the call over to John Little, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of the financials. And, of course, we will then open the call up for questions.
So let me start today by saying that I am very pleased with the progress we are making in the transition we started two years ago, which is towards our vision of becoming the online security company, offering integrated and easy-to-use security services anywhere any of us go online. This transition has also enabled us to develop a much more predictable and sustainable financial model, as evidenced by the results we are reporting today.
In the third quarter, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 17%, despite facing much stiffer FX headwinds than we've seen so far this year. Growth continues to be driven by strength in subscription revenue, which grew 28% over the same period last year, and which continues to comprise the vast majority of total revenue. Along with this, we generated cash conversion of 25% for the quarter.

To achieve our vision, our strategy has been simple; optimize and expand our core consumer business, building on the great foundation we have established over the years, while thoughtfully investing in the growing segments of mobile and small and medium business.
Now let me share a few of the highlights in each of our business segments with you today. First, in our consumer segment, we continue to add products and services and over the past two years have evolved from two products on one platform to four product families across multiple platforms. This expansion has helped us meet the growing consumer demand for security across all devices, as well as execute on our goal to diversify and broaden our offerings in order to mitigate dependence on any single product.
Today, our consumer segment includes products in each of the categories of privacy, protection and performance. These include our core products like AV or antivirus and TuneUp, as well as Privax, our privacy solution through the acquisition of the same company, and mobile services such as those provided from Location Labs, as well as our growing category of alternative monetization technologies including search and advertising. And all of these are being integrated under the AVG Zen initiatives that I will talk more about.
So let me go into more detail on each of these. The core of our consumer business are desktop antivirus and TuneUp products continues to perform very well. This quarter we grew desktop revenue 4% against what many of you'd know is a very challenging market, and simply, I think the team did a fantastic job this quarter. Along with this, adoption of AVG Zen-enabled products is progressing with strong results.
We ended the third quarter with 17 million total Zen users, up over 50% from 11 million last quarter. This was driven by our move from the control-testing phase of the rollout of Zen-enabled products to a much more comprehensive, systematic deployment, which included rollout to multiple new geographies, as well as broader availability and distribution, including a larger base of free users.
With this broader rollout, I'm very encouraged that the key statistics around AVG Zen continue to be strong. Specifically, the registration rate for Zen-enabled PC products remains substantially higher than the 3% for non-Zen enabled products. And the ratio of applications per device continues to rise and is now at 1.37 applications per device compared for 1.08 for non-Zen enabled mobile products.
This is very significant, because the deployment to free users typically would reduce conversion substantially, which tells us that the core benefit of Zen to simplify the adoption of a broader set of security, privacy and identity solutions for users around the world, appears to be valued by our users.
As the expanded rollout continues, we will implement additional monetization schemes that we will test along with, of course, the continuation of our base monetization strategy. And in this, we expect to turn on the full subscription engine in the first half of 2016.
Also in our consumer business, our recent acquisition of Privax, a leading provider of digital privacy services to consumers, including the award-winning VPN service, is progressing well and in line with our optimistic expectations. This quarter alone, we saw nearly 50% growth in users signing up for recurring billing plans.
Turning to platform, both sides of this business, the organic and inorganic side, continued as expected. Starting with the inorganic search business, we continued to successfully wind this down, consistent with the plan that we announced when we exited the business nearly two years ago.
On the organic search business, this remained steady and performed to our expectations. However, I must comment that the search market itself continues to be quite dynamic. Over the last several years, we've managed, through various significant changes, including browser policy and technology changes, terms of service changes, and operating platform changes. And this year is no exception. In fact, the pace of change in this industry seems to have increased. Most recently, major browser providers have developed new strategies to protect their default search offerings, which typically means that users must take even more actions if they want to change their search provider. Now given the complexity and time required to this, less users actually make it all the way through the flow, which of course, affects our conversion rate.

The rollout of the new Windows 10 operating system is also accelerating, which introduces even more restrictions for search placements on that platform. The combination of these factors has undoubtedly increased the volatility in this market, creating uncertainty in our revenue expectations for search going forward. The good news is, given the solid performance in our other areas of growth and our more diversified revenue base now, we believe we can mitigate the impact on some of these changes we will likely face going forward. John and I will talk more about this later on in the call.
Turning now to our investment areas and starting with mobile, I'm very pleased to report that we saw increases in both our carrier-based distribution revenue as well as our emerging investment areas, including mobile advertising and direct-to-consumer licensing. Total mobile revenue for the quarter was $17.4 million, resulting in revenue in the first nine months of the year of $46.8 million. This validates our previous guidance that mobile is expected to be a $60 million to $70 million business in 2015. Within this, Location Labs is performing very well and in line with our expectation. The core rollouts that we had scheduled are progressing on plan, and we're beginning to develop and deploy new products into this channel also.
Last week, at Futurecom in Brazil, we introduced the first collaborative product between AVG and Location Labs, which is the AVG Family Graph. Now put very shortly, AVG Family Graph enables users to connect and communicate with family members using their location app, while also creating an ongoing family social graph, which really provides a view into intra-family connections.
While providing great benefit to users, it also helps operators attract and retain valuable family plan subscribers, which have been successful in the U.S. and are now a high priority for carriers in the international market. I'm encouraged by the initial feedback of this launch and look forward to reporting more as these products and others develop into the future.
Also in mobile, we continue to work on and develop new go-to-market partnerships for our mobile products. We currently have partnerships in place with Sony, TCL, and ZTE. And as they all continue to come on line and deliver more handsets, we are seeing increased adoption of our products and now have nearly 16 million active users from these partnerships, which is up from 14 million since our last earnings.
Like you, we've been watching the turmoil in the handset market as the device manufacturers compete for position in the global market. And because of this, we don't believe we have yet fully benefited from these relationships, but given the progress we have made as well as the new partnerships that we are developing and will announce, we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity as the market settles and matures.
Turning to SMB, we delivered 13% top-line growth over last year, as we continued to invest in this important segment. As we discussed in the last earnings call, our expectation of the uptake of our cloud-based services was not where we wanted it to be as a result of our existing customers' commitment to our traditional on-premise product.
To fix this, we have taken specific actions to improve our go-to market strategy, including a significant restructuring and streamlining of the business and further simplification of our products to make it even easier for our resellers to go out with our products to serve their end customers' needs. This restructuring and leadership changes, we believe, will put us in the right position to capitalize on a large and growing opportunity.
We believe strongly in this market and we'll continue to invest as we have been in anticipation of accelerated growth in the future. To do this, we have also continued to deliver best-in-class products. And during the quarter, we launched AVG Business Managed Workplace Version 9.2. This latest version contains multiple enhancements and is a fully-integrated remote management and monitoring platform that is winning quite a lot of critical acclaim. It is developed based on an award-winning technology and should augment our improved go-to market strategy to really enhance our cloud offering.

So that's a brief summary of the core consumer business as well as our investments in mobile and SMB. All of this has allowed us to increase our paid user count, which was a core focus we started last quarter. Today, we are very pleased to announce that we have surpassed 20 million paid users, which is a major milestone indicating that we are actually executing quite well on our monetization strategies.
Total users remain steady to slightly up at just over 200 million for the quarter, which is in line with my previous comments on our heightened focus on paid users, as well as reflection of the current dynamics affecting our mobile channel distribution partners. Going forward, we believe that the more accurate measure of our success will be paid user growth as well as total mobile user growth.
Finally, while we can talk about all the great things that we've done, it is always nice to get external recognition and we are pleased that we've received some awards over the (13:53) something we all take great pride in.
First of all, AVG scored 100% with AV-TEST as we achieved 1,005 detection rate of real world malware and a 100% detection of widespread malware. Second, AV-Comparatives Malware Removal report awarded AVG with the highest award mark of Advanced+.
Now, in recognition of a lot of this plus so much more, AVG remained rank number six globally and the top European company on the Cybersecurity 500 list. As you will recall, investments in the quality and value of our products has been a core focus for us over the last two years, and I'm very proud of the entire team for their contributions to make this happen.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to stress that the growth and diversification we have realized over the past few years has been achieved with roughly the same capital structure as we had when we went public 3.5 years ago.
We are committed to continuing this efficient stewardship of our capital, and in keeping with this, we are announcing today a new share repurchase program of up to $40 million. The program will become effective when our trading window opens next Monday, and our goal is to complete about 75% of this over the next three quarters.
With that, let me now turn the call over John Little to review the financials in more detail. John?
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
Hello, everybody. In Q3, we delivered total revenue of $108.2 million and earnings per share of $0.42. Our subscription business contributed $87.8 million of revenue, while our platform business contributed $20.4 million. Subscription revenue grew 28%, driving total revenue growth to 17% over the same period last year. And we're pleased to report that the share of sustainable, predictable subscription revenue has increased again to 81% of total revenue compared to 74% a year ago. Platform revenue showed a contraction of 14% over the same period last year, which was entirely driven by our continued exit from the third-party distribution business.
Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $2.9 million, total revenue for the quarter would have amounted to $111.1 million. Year-to-date, we have now seen an estimated negative impact on our revenue from foreign exchange of $7.2 million and on booking of $15.7 million. Bookings for the quarter were $106.7 million compared $85.9 million over the same period last year.
From a segment perspective, the consumer business contributed $91.6 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $77.7 million over the same period last year, representing 18% growth. Driving this number was an increase in consumer subscription revenue, which reached $71.2 million compared to $54 million in Q3 2014, an increase of 32%.
Consumer desktop revenue reached $55.1 million in the quarter, showing an increase of 4% over the same period last year, with an improvement in renewal rate, largely driven by auto billing acceptance; auto billing being a default feature in our new product.

Total mobile revenue was $17.4 million in the quarter, up from $1.7 million over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued growth in carrier-based distribution. Of this revenue, $16.1 million was subscription revenue with the remainder being platform revenue from mobile advertising.
And finally, within the consumer segment, our platform revenue is $20.4 million; $19.1 million of search with the balance being primarily mobile advertising. Searches were approximately 650 million compared to 740 million in Q3 2014. Third party search revenue accounted for $1.9 million compared with $5.6 million a year ago.
Turning to SMB; this segment contributed $16.6 million in revenue in the third quarter, compared with $14.7 million last year. This increase of 13% in SMB revenue was driven primarily by the Norman acquisition. During the third quarter 2015, SMB annualized monthly recurring revenue reached $22 million compared to approximately $19 million a year ago. Combined AMRR for the quarter, including Location Labs, Privax and SMB reached $94 million, up from $87 million in the previous quarter.
Now, SMB has made significant progress over the last 12 months, but as Gary said, we did not feel it was progressing at the rate we expected. Accordingly, we have undertaken a restructuring of the segment to ensure we are both more focused on our strategic objectives to drive monthly subscription revenues, and to reach breakeven status, which we have targeted to be Q4 2015.
We are taking a number of actions to realize this, including releasing approximately 35 employees, outsourcing in proportion of our helpdesk, as well as restructuring the management of the division. We estimate that this will save us around $3 million over the next 12 months, and we intend to apply these savings and focus spending to continue to drive this business. We remain confident in the business opportunity in front of SMB and believe that these actions will allow us to attain our growth objectives more quickly.
Turning to user detail, total active users at quarter end were 202 million compared with 188 million a year ago. Mobile users reached 108 million, showing an increase of 18 million or 20% year-over-year, as our partnerships with mobile manufacturers and carriers gain traction. Sequentially, total user count remained flat as growth in the mobile user count was offset reductions in free desktop users.
During the quarter, the paid user count reached the milestone of 20 million compared to 14 million a year ago, again, driven by growth in mobile user count. While paid desktop users remain flat, we continue to drive value from them with paid consumer desktop ARPU rising to $6.72 compared to $6.10 in the third quarter last year, an increase of over 10%.
Turning to margins and profitability; gross profit margin was 87% compared to 91% last year, mainly due to additional infrastructure to support the increasing scale of the business, and acquisition accounting impacts of our recently acquired companies.
Operating income for the third quarter was $29.5 million, and operating margin was 27%. This compares with $34.8 million and 38% year-over-year. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the impact of acquisition and additional compliance-driven expenditures, although we did spend additional from the marketing during the quarter, as we continued the evolution of our business model. Operating margin year-to-date remained strong at 29%.
Interest and other expense in the quarter was $4.1 million compared to $1.2 million a year ago. Net income was $22.2 million in the quarter compared to $29.4 million during the same period last year, yielding diluted earnings per share of $0.42 when taking into consideration 53.3 million weighted average shares outstanding.

Excluding $3.8 million in expenses related to enhancing the company's internal financial controls and procedures, net income would have been $26 million or $0.49 per diluted share. These expenses, which are expected to decrease substantially by the first quarter of 2016, were driven by the significant investments being taken to implement new internal controls and systems that are commensurate with the scale and complexity of our current business.
Turning to cash flow, free cash flow was $27.4 million and cash conversion 25% in the quarter, compared with $16.4 million and 18% year-over-year. Cash conversion year-to-date stands at 19%. After an intensive year of M&A activity and backed by the strong cash flow of the business, we would like to announce, as planned, the initiation of a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program. This will be for approximately $40 million in total, of which we expect to execute around $30 million over the next few quarters. Further detail will be announced externally in forthcoming days.
Looking to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $144.5 million as of September 30, 2015 compared with $117.2 million at the end of the previous quarter and $44 million at the end of Q3 2014. Due to strong cash generation, the net debt position was reduced from $107 million at the end of the second quarter to $79.2 million at the end of the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we will be paying another installment of the performance based Location Labs earn-out of approximately $25 million. Deferred revenue at September 30, 2015 was $196.7 million compared to $188.7 million over the same period last year.
Turning to our outlook for 2015, based on the information currently available, we are narrowing our previously stated expectations of full year 2015 revenue to be in the range of $426 million to $430 million. Net income is expected to be approximately $95 million or roughly $1.80 per diluted ordinary share based on approximately 53 million shares outstanding. Operating margins are expected to be 30%.
As you've heard, I've decided to leave AVG and I'll be staying with the company to ensure a smooth transition to my successor. I'd like to provide – I'd like to take this opportunity to provide a brief summary of how we've transformed our business in the 3.5 years since the IPO, something of which I'm very proud.
In Q1 2012, we had $46.5 million in subscription revenue and two basic products, various versions of PC security for consumer SMBs and PC TuneUp.
As of this quarter, we have subscription revenue of $87.8 million, an increase of 88%. And as Gary said, we've also added additional product families. We've developed AVG Zen to deliver cross platform services, built two SMB SaaS products, CloudCare and Managed Workplace, and acquired two mobile products in location and control. Most recently, we acquired Privax, which gives us a VPN privacy offering.
Now, the nearly $88 million of subscription-based revenue in this quarter, roughly $55 million is highly predictable, based on renewals and monthly SaaS subscriptions. And this $65 million in recurring revenue is more than we had in total subscription revenue when we went public.
Further, we've diversified into new strategic areas and today over 30% of this recurring revenue is mobile and SaaS, which we have grown in the last three years from zero. I think if you look around Silicon Valley, this would constitute a very large mobile and SaaS security business with 50% growth last year and growing at 30% heading into next year. And we've done this (27:08) roughly the same share count and the same net debt as when we went public. And I believe from here, our strategic opportunities continue to broaden and deepen. And now back to Gary for closing remarks.

Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Thank you, John. Before I open up the call for your questions, I want to make a few remarks on some of the dynamics in our business that are creating the uncertainty we referenced earlier, and as we close out the year and look towards 2016. As evidenced by our results each quarter so far this year, we have made enormous progress in the transition of our business to a diversified subscription and SaaS-based revenue stream, of which John just talked about.
Putting this in perspective, for the first nine months of the (27:55) subscription revenue grew 26%, and now comprises 81% of total revenue. And during the same period, SaaS revenue has grown over 500% and now comprising 17% of total revenue.
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a substantial increase in volatility in our search business, driven by the market dynamics which are out of our control. What this means is that part of our business, the non-core, non-subscription and non-SaaS business, has very little visibility, and consequently, future revenue from search is quite uncertain.
While it is impossible to know or predict the full impact of this, it is likely to have an impact on our top line, though to what extent we are still trying to model. That said, given the success of our revenue diversification strategy, and the fact that our key areas of growth are firing on all cylinders, I feel confident that we should be able to mitigate some of this impact, and we will continue to test new strategies and report more on this over the coming quarters.
So with that, I'd like to close on a personal note. I want to thank John for an enormous contribution over the past seven years and for the partnership he and I have formed since I arrived. John is a true professional and, more than that, a good human. Thank you, John.
And with all of that, I want to open up for your questions.
Bonnie McBride - Vice President, Investor Relations

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We would take our first question from Melissa Gorham with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sorry to see you go, John, the best of luck. Just a question for Gary on the consumer desktop business, I'm specifically wondering what you're seeing with Windows 10 adoption. I know it's still early days, but I'm just wondering if you're seeing any change in consumer behavior when they're adopting Win 10 PCs in terms of adopting security solutions?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Yeah. Melissa, thank you. It's a good question. So, on the desktop, there's two sets of answers to that. There's one around our core products and there's one, which I talked a little bit about, around search. So, on our core products, we're actually seeing very good results, very good uptake and sort of consistent with what we have experienced over the past. So, that's a positive development because, as you know, any time there's a platform shift, that can initiate different obstacles, if you will, to adoption or conversion. And based on paid user count and based on the continued growth of our conversion, we're very encouraged by that. So, that's on that side of the business.
On the consumer side, or sorry, on the search side, Windows 10 is something that we are just beginning to model how the adoption of our search-based products will actually be. And so it appears that it's going to be a difficult challenge and it's something that we have to model still. We're about three weeks into it, so the data is just too inconclusive. So, that's what I was really focused on in the last part of my remarks after John, but we're going to continue to press on that. And that's the only part of the business that's a little bit variable at this point. The rest is really firing well.

Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up for John; in terms of the full-year guidance, the midpoint for revenue did move down just a little bit lower. Can you maybe describe what areas of your business you are just being a little bit more conservative? Is that just from the platform side of the business, or is there something on the subscription side?
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
It's a little bit on the SMB. The platform is holding up quite well. But as Gary said, we've got some uncertainties in there. And the main thing that's been coming through and continuing, I think has been the FX, Melissa. I think on a number of calls I've said, look, the idea of having of that broad range at the beginning of the year was to be able to absorb any of the movements in the FX. And clearly, that's going to be over $10 million we would now expect for the full year. (32:33) up those points around it. But as you say, the overall movement is pretty small right now.
Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
We will now take our next question from Vahid Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please go ahead.
Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial, Inc.
Actually a follow-up on that last one. You also moved the lower revenue guidance. Could you provide some insight into what visibility you're seeing to drive that higher?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
You mean $420 million to – I mean could you ask it a slightly different way?
Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial, Inc.
The lower level of the revenue guidance before was $420 million, and now it's $426 million. So I just wanted to get some insight on what visibility you have that you were able to increase it.
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
I've got it. Yes. On the other side of that, we're certainly able to look at what we've delivered during the year, and of course it's November 4 now, so a number of the things during July has continued to go well, as Gary said, on the consumer side and so on. So that's given us a great deal of confidence to where we get to from the – and hence, being able to take up that bottom end of the range from $420 million to $426 million.
Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial, Inc.
Okay. And I wanted to ask you about ARPU. One of the challenges seems to be growing ARPU and growing the paid subscriber base, not just in your business but in any business. I mean, what strategically are you seeing playing out in that dynamic for you guys?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
In terms of the overall paid users, we're seeing a couple of things. The first is that the big growth has come from the paid users on mobile. So, that's a reflection of our organic products, but primarily Location Labs continuing to be extremely successful.
On the paid users on the desktop, I think the opportunity there is simply that we're saying, okay, we have sort of groups of people in some key markets with a strong propensity to pay. And as we introduce additional products to those people whether it's products like GMS or AVG Ultimate that we've talked about, we've been able to drive the ARPU on that particular trend up by 10% year-over-year. So, those are the two specific things. And I think both of those are a function of just having the number of active users that we do to be able to drive both the paid user number up and the focus on driving that ARPU up, in other words, getting those guys to do that by introducing great products that people want to buy.
Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial, Inc.

We will now move to our next question from Joe Maxa with Dougherty & Company. Please go ahead.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Thank you. I wanted to ask again on the uncertainties related to search. It sounds like with the guidance for Q4, you have a pretty good idea or range. Is the uncertainty more related to, as you look into 2015, that you think that could be even more, I guess, unstable, if you will? 2016, sorry.

Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Yeah. Joe, thank you for the question. So, there's actually some of it in the remainder of the year. We have – some of the new policy and guideline changes are just coming to effect as is the ability to place and affect search on Windows 10. And those are the things that are new that we are just experimenting with.
So we've incorporated some of that, if you will, uncertainty into Q4 remainder guidance, which then forms the guidance for the year. But certainly, if amplified, of course, just by the mere fact of time, as we move into 2016, so. And that variability is really going to be a factor of some of the tests that we do over the next two, three months. We just need more market data to really understand what that impact is. But it appears from the early testing that it's going to be a broader impact than just one surface, if you will, of search.
So, I know many of you that follow the different markets and the different companies in the space have seen some of this commentary from these other organizations. So, we're certainly not immune to it and that's – we're trying to model the impact to us.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
I see. With the SMB segment and the restructuring, are you still expecting that to hit breakeven in Q4? Is that – I know it's probably a target, but do you think that's realistic? And then, what type of restructuring charges should we be thinking about that you'll be reporting for 4Q?
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
For 4Q, the restructuring charges, we still got to look at, but as I said, the savings that we've got for the full year are the $3 million that initially that we've estimated, and there's some more to come after that, we think.
In terms of getting to breakeven, Joe, yes, we believe that we're going to get there. That's absolutely our focus. We've given that commitment and that's important. And we're looking at – and I think actually, I want to expand on that a little bit. The way that we're looking at this is that we will also run it on a breakeven basis during 2016 as the sort of objective that we're looking at there.
In other words to say, as the business continues to grow and accelerate that we'll continue to invest in it. But a lot of the, let's say, heavy-lifting investment that Gary referred to, I would say, is behind us now and that has been done during 2015.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. And then last for me on the Location Labs, you talked about an international carrier you thought you can sign on by year-end. It seems like you have some progress in Brazil. Was that still a target or do you think that's going to happen?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
It's still a target, yes, it is. And we're very – we're pleased with the initiatives that we're doing around different carriers in many different regions of the world. So, we're still very much focused on that.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.

We will now move to our next question from Fred Grieb with Nomura. Please go ahead.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Hey, guys. Just two for me. First up, some of the consumer-focused companies this quarter saw some involuntary churn from the ongoing transition to chip-based credit cards in the States. I'm wondering if there's any impact to your guys' subscription revenue in the quarter from that.
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Yeah. So well, the subscription results, I think, we talked about. It's hard to know how many we didn't get as a result of the chip. We certainly saw that. We think we did a good job in mitigating it, but it certainly factored into and does factor into our guidance for the remainder of the year. I think anytime we have auto renew and every time we have credit card and certainly the percentage of our base that is U.S. will be impacted, but that's a relatively small number compared to our international. So, we're going to be mitigated to that degree.

Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. And then, second question, just in 2016, can we expect more acquisitions from you guys or do you think it'll take some time to digest the ones you have and use the cash to do this kind of repo that you announced?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Well, it's – the acquisitions that we have done have been both transformative as well as optimizing our near-zero marginal cost channel. I think in the second category that if we had opportunities of a small, what I'll call, sort of nipple-size, I think we'd look at them. It's not our intention to do major transformative acquisitions at this point. Of course, sometimes they crop up and we have to take a look at them. But I would say that we'd be much more interested in doing those little nipple sizes.
But that said, right now from a capital allocation point of view, we believe the share repurchases are very effective way to put our money to work and we think it also achieves sort of our longer-term efficient capital allocation strategy and mitigates the ongoing effect of dilution from shares and employee share plans and so forth. So that's where we're focused right now.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it.
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
Just some quantitative numbers around Gary's comment on the renewals. Auto billing acceptance continues to go up and is now over 93%. So again that bodes very well for the future. The newer products have got also billing by default. So that's also extremely positive there. Our payment record transactions seem to indicate steady monthly activity. So if other people have seen that, that isn't something that we've seen yet.
And as a result of all this, we've seen our consumer online renewal rate, which is probably our most indicative measure, increase year-over-year and sequentially by 1% year-over-year and 2%, so 1 percentage point year-over-year and 2 percentage points sequentially.
So there's a number of factors there, when I talked about the recurring – the strengthening, recurring nature of business, to just give you some quantitative elements to back that up.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. That's really helpful color. Thanks a lot, guys. And John, really sorry to see you go.
John Little - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, man.
Operator
We will now move to our next question which comes from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.
Michael Wonchoon Kim - Imperial Capital LLC
Hi, guys. Just wanted to go back to the SMB side, I understand the internal changes. Maybe if you could expand on a little bit on the puts and takes around the perpetual versus the subscription side of the business, and where some of the – there might be a little disconnect with the resellers in the need to sort of simplify the product lineup.
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Yeah. I would say that the – in order of priority, or in order of impact this quarter, it certainly has been go-to-market challenges that we needed to address. I think I reported, probably about a year and a half ago, that we were making significant investments in the product, and those investments have really helped, and they've begun to pay off.
In that though, it's given us a much more competitive, and when I say competitive, I mean competitive with both the market as well as our on-premise offerings, our cloud offerings, and it has exposed some challenges that we've had and taken it to (43:51) market, being quite open. And those challenges are not that we have bad people; we just need additional skill-set in these new areas of SaaS (44:00) and selling SaaS. And as we've learned, both for our resellers as well as ourselves, it's a very different sales process. And it can be managed, but we just need to inject some of this new skill.

So with that, we've taken a new approach to how we organize our channel team, as well as how we segment our channel teams. We've changed out our leadership to more appropriately accelerate. So we just brought in some of that skill, and I'm very, very excited about the changes we've made there. Certainly, over the last six weeks, it's proven to be pointing us in a very useful and valuable direction. And I think they've been able to now look at things in a way that's going to help us balance and grow the newer parts of our portfolio at a more rapid rate.
So, most of this, I just want to – in full transparency, is a go-to-market challenge that we have had this last sort of three, four months that we've been talking about. I think the product will continue to evolve, but the work that we've done over the last year and a half, I think, has put us in a good place. So I don't want to categorize today that we have a product that won't hunt, so to speak. We just have a team that needs to continue to grow and diversify its skill base, and I know we have the right leadership in there now to do that.
Michael Wonchoon Kim - Imperial Capital LLC
Got it. Great. And then just turning to Privax, could you talk a little about the integration progress? It sounds like it's on par with your expectations, and maybe to put that in sort of specific terms, if you think you're on track to that $10 million expectation for the year, and then the longer term 2016 outlook?
Gary Kovacs - Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director
Yeah. So answering the last part of your question first, yes, we are on track. Certainly, we are on track for both this year as well as the 2016 outlook. We're actually hopeful, and I know the Privax team (45:47) so this will put me on record. We're hopeful that a continued – an increased injection of spend which would model into (45:57) 2016 will also accelerate it even further. So we have a lot of belief.
And partially that's driven by, or mostly that's driven by, what I'm calling at this point, probably more market demand and interest in this space than we anticipated. So partially, that's driven by, of course, negative societal events, where there's a lot more snooping and a lot more tracking, and a lot less privacy than we anticipated. So people are really starting to take this as a call for them to take action. And particularly when they travel or when they're in a public Wi-Fi space, they're looking for ways to secure the connection, and we think we're very well purposed.
We've also got, and nothing that we're announcing today, some pretty exciting new product initiatives that will come to market. So, I put all that together and this year's plan, for sure we're on track, next year's plan, for sure we're on track. But I actually believe that there's more to it than that.
Michael Wonchoon Kim - Imperial Capital LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And John, wish you well. Enjoyed working with you.
John Little - Chief Financial Officer

Early life[edit]
Kovacs was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Ruby (né Kiraly) and Janos (John) Kovacs. Kovacs's father was a Hungarian refugee who fled to Canada in 1956.[6]
Kovacs attended the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business, earning a BComm in 1990 and an MBA in 1999.[7]
Career[edit]





This biographical section is written like a résumé. Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. (September 2015)


Kovacs spent more than 25 years in software and mobile technology. In addition to his undergraduate and graduate business degrees, Kovacs is a certified communications electronics technologist.[8]
Kovacs joined IBM in 1990, where he held leadership positions in product management, sales, marketing, and operations, eventually serving as Worldwide Program Director for the software division, based in New York.[9][10]
After 10 years at IBM, Kovacs became President of Zi Corporation, a company that pioneered predictive text, among other mobile search and text input solutions.[11][12] From 2000 to 2003, he helmed the company’s successful creation and growth and provided strategic direction for its worldwide expansion.[13]
Kovacs moved to Macromedia in 2003, working as Vice President of Product Marketing. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, Kovacs became Vice President and General Manager of Product Management and Marketing for Adobe’s mobile and devices division,[14] rising to General Manager of the entire division in 2008.[15]
From 2009 to 2010, Kovacs served as Senior Vice President of Markets, Solutions, and Products at Sybase, through its acquisition by SAP.[16]
After an extensive search for a new CEO in 2010, Mozilla selected Kovacs to replace former CEO John Lilly. Kovacs led the overall direction of the organization and the Firefox web browser.[17]
During Kovacs' tenure Mozilla expanded into the mobile market with the launch of Firefox OS, its open mobile operating system.[18] Kovacs previewed Firefox OS at Mobile World Congress 2013, garnering commitments from 18 major worldwide mobile operators.[19]
In 2012, Kovacs negotiated a reported $1 billion deal renewing Mozilla’s agreement to make Google the default search engine in Firefox.[20]
Kovacs also steered Mozilla to a position as industry leader in Internet privacy initiatives. Most notably, Firefox now offers Collusion, an add-on that enables users to view all third parties tracking their online activity, and in turn, to make more informed decisions about being tracked.[21] The Ponemon Institute named Mozilla the “Most Trusted Internet Company For Privacy” for 2012.[22]
Kovacs is a frequent public speaker and panel member. His 2012 TED talk "Tracking the Trackers" explores issues of Internet privacy in an increasingly connected world.[23] At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012, he presented on strategies for creating a resilient cyber economy amid economic, security, and privacy obstacles.[24] He was a keynote speaker at the Mobile World Congress 2013.[25]
Fierce Wireless named Kovacs one of the Rising Stars in Wireless for 2013.[26]
On April 2013 Mozilla announced that he would step down as CEO of the corporation later that year[27] and until March 2014 he was part of Mozilla's board of directors.[28]
On July 30, 2013, Kovacs joined[29] AVG Technologies as CEO. In September 2016, AVG Technologies was acquired by Avast Software [30] Kovacs was terminated [31] from AVG Technologies in December 2016.
Personal life[edit]
Raised by Hungarian parents in Toronto, Kovacs began experimenting with technology at a young age. Though grateful for the opportunities and education provided by his native Canada, his interest in innovation drew him to the San Francisco Bay Area.[32]
He now lives in Piedmont, California.[33]

Early life[edit]

Career[edit]





This biographical section is written like a résumé. Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. (September 2015)


Kovacs spent more than 25 years in software and mobile technology. In addition to his undergraduate and graduate business degrees, Kovacs is a certified communications electronics technologist.[8]
Kovacs joined IBM in 1990, where he held leadership positions in product management, sales, marketing, and operations, eventually serving as Worldwide Program Director for the software division, based in New York.[9][10]
After 10 years at IBM, Kovacs became President of Zi Corporation, a company that pioneered predictive text, among other mobile search and text input solutions.[11][12] From 2000 to 2003, he helmed the company’s successful creation and growth and provided strategic direction for its worldwide expansion.[13]
Kovacs moved to Macromedia in 2003, working as Vice President of Product Marketing. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, Kovacs became Vice President and General Manager of Product Management and Marketing for Adobe’s mobile and devices division,[14] rising to General Manager of the entire division in 2008.[15]
From 2009 to 2010, Kovacs served as Senior Vice President of Markets, Solutions, and Products at Sybase, through its acquisition by SAP.[16]
After an extensive search for a new CEO in 2010, Mozilla selected Kovacs to replace former CEO John Lilly. Kovacs led the overall direction of the organization and the Firefox web browser.[17]
During Kovacs' tenure Mozilla expanded into the mobile market with the launch of Firefox OS, its open mobile operating system.[18] Kovacs previewed Firefox OS at Mobile World Congress 2013, garnering commitments from 18 major worldwide mobile operators.[19]
In 2012, Kovacs negotiated a reported $1 billion deal renewing Mozilla’s agreement to make Google the default search engine in Firefox.[20]
Kovacs also steered Mozilla to a position as industry leader in Internet privacy initiatives. Most notably, Firefox now offers Collusion, an add-on that enables users to view all third parties tracking their online activity, and in turn, to make more informed decisions about being tracked.[21] The Ponemon Institute named Mozilla the “Most Trusted Internet Company For Privacy” for 2012.[22]
Kovacs is a frequent public speaker and panel member. His 2012 TED talk "Tracking the Trackers" explores issues of Internet privacy in an increasingly connected world.[23] At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012, he presented on strategies for creating a resilient cyber economy amid economic, security, and privacy obstacles.[24] He was a keynote speaker at the Mobile World Congress 2013.[25]
Fierce Wireless named Kovacs one of the Rising Stars in Wireless for 2013.[26]
On April 2013 Mozilla announced that he would step down as CEO of the corporation later that year[27] and until March 2014 he was part of Mozilla's board of directors.[28]
On July 30, 2013, Kovacs joined[29] AVG Technologies as CEO. In September 2016, AVG Technologies was acquired by Avast Software [30] Kovacs was terminated [31] from AVG Technologies in December 2016.
Personal life[edit]
Raised by Hungarian parents in Toronto, Kovacs began experimenting with technology at a young age. Though grateful for the opportunities and education provided by his native Canada, his interest in innovation drew him to the San Francisco Bay Area.[32]
He now lives in Piedmont, California.[33]

As you surf the Web, information is being collected about you. Web tracking is not 100% evil — personal data can make your browsing more efficient; cookies can help your favorite websites stay in business. But, says Gary Kovacs, it's your right to know what data is being collected about you. He unveils a Firefox add-on, Collusion, to do just that. (Update: Collusion is now called Lightbeam.)

Early life[edit]
Kovacs was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Ruby (né Kiraly) and Janos (John) Kovacs. Kovacs's father was a Hungarian refugee who fled to Canada in 1956.[6]
Kovacs attended the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business, earning a BComm in 1990 and an MBA in 1999.[7]
Career[edit]





This biographical section is written like a résumé. Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. (September 2015)


Kovacs spent more than 25 years in software and mobile technology. In addition to his undergraduate and graduate business degrees, Kovacs is a certified communications electronics technologist.[8]
Kovacs joined IBM in 1990, where he held leadership positions in product management, sales, marketing, and operations, eventually serving as Worldwide Program Director for the software division, based in New York.[9][10]
After 10 years at IBM, Kovacs became President of Zi Corporation, a company that pioneered predictive text, among other mobile search and text input solutions.[11][12] From 2000 to 2003, he helmed the company’s successful creation and growth and provided strategic direction for its worldwide expansion.[13]
Kovacs moved to Macromedia in 2003, working as Vice President of Product Marketing. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, Kovacs became Vice President and General Manager of Product Management and Marketing for Adobe’s mobile and devices division,[14] rising to General Manager of the entire division in 2008.[15]
From 2009 to 2010, Kovacs served as Senior Vice President of Markets, Solutions, and Products at Sybase, through its acquisition by SAP.[16]
After an extensive search for a new CEO in 2010, Mozilla selected Kovacs to replace former CEO John Lilly. Kovacs led the overall direction of the organization and the Firefox web browser.[17]
During Kovacs' tenure Mozilla expanded into the mobile market with the launch of Firefox OS, its open mobile operating system.[18] Kovacs previewed Firefox OS at Mobile World Congress 2013, garnering commitments from 18 major worldwide mobile operators.[19]
In 2012, Kovacs negotiated a reported $1 billion deal renewing Mozilla’s agreement to make Google the default search engine in Firefox.[20]
Kovacs also steered Mozilla to a position as industry leader in Internet privacy initiatives. Most notably, Firefox now offers Collusion, an add-on that enables users to view all third parties tracking their online activity, and in turn, to make more informed decisions about being tracked.[21] The Ponemon Institute named Mozilla the “Most Trusted Internet Company For Privacy” for 2012.[22]
Kovacs is a frequent public speaker and panel member. His 2012 TED talk "Tracking the Trackers" explores issues of Internet privacy in an increasingly connected world.[23] At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012, he presented on strategies for creating a resilient cyber economy amid economic, security, and privacy obstacles.[24] He was a keynote speaker at the Mobile World Congress 2013.[25]
Fierce Wireless named Kovacs one of the Rising Stars in Wireless for 2013.[26]
On April 2013 Mozilla announced that he would step down as CEO of the corporation later that year[27] and until March 2014 he was part of Mozilla's board of directors.[28]
On July 30, 2013, Kovacs joined[29] AVG Technologies as CEO. In September 2016, AVG Technologies was acquired by Avast Software [30] Kovacs was terminated [31] from AVG Technologies in December 2016.
Personal life[edit]
Raised by Hungarian parents in Toronto, Kovacs began experimenting with technology at a young age. Though grateful for the opportunities and education provided by his native Canada, his interest in innovation drew him to the San Francisco Bay Area.[32]
He now lives in Piedmont, California.[33]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
