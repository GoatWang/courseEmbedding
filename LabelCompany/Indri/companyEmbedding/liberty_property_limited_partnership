A Word from Our CEO

		When Bill Rouse, our founder, hired me in 2001 to be Liberty's chief investment officer, he said something I thought at the time was very strange.  He told me that my performance, and my advancement, would be judged not by him, but by my peers.  I totally did not get that.  Wasn't Bill the CEO?  Didn't he make all the decisions?
		
		It didn't take long for me to understand.  Liberty is a place where people work together in collaboration.  We help others learn and advance, and we help ourselves in the process.  We believe, with all our hearts, that our culture has a positive impact on the services and products we provide for our customers.
		
		Liberty has room for many people, many different kinds of people with many different talents, but all with a passion for achieving success through mutual trust and cooperation.
		
		We want you to succeed.  Come and join us.
		


Bill Hankowsky
			Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

Liberty Property Limited Partn



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Liberty Property Limited Partnership carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Liberty Property Limited Partnership



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Liberty Property Limited Partnership



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Liberty Property Limited Partnership



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Liberty Property Trust (the "Trust") is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Substantially all of the Trust's assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust's operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership" and, collectively with the Trust and their consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company"). The Company owns and operates industrial properties nationally and owns and operates office properties in a focused group of office markets. Additionally, the Company owns certain assets in the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2014, the Company owned and operated 489 industrial and 180 office properties (the "Wholly Owned Properties in Operation") totaling 91.3 million square feet. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, the Company owned 25 properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise 4.3 million square feet (the "Wholly Owned Properties under Development") and 1,491 acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, the Company had an ownership interest, through unconsolidated joint ventures, in 49 industrial and 34 office properties totaling 14.3 million square feet (the "JV Properties in Operation" and, together with the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation, the "Properties in Operation"), four properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise 2.1 million square feet and a 222-room Four Seasons Hotel (the "JV Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Wholly Owned Properties under Development, the "Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Properties in Operation, the "Properties") and 460 acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use.  The Company focuses on creating value for shareholders and increasing profitability and cash flow. With respect to its Properties in Operation, the Company endeavors to maintain high occupancy levels while maximizing rental rates and controlling costs. The Company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield acceptable returns. The Company also acquires properties that it believes will create long-term value, and disposes of properties that no longer fit within the Company's strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds. The Company expects its strategy with respect to product and market selection to favor industrial and metro-office properties and markets with strong demographic and economic fundamentals.  Consistent with its strategy, on October 8, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding general partnership and limited partnership interests of the Cabot Industrial Value Fund III Operating Partnership, L.P. ("Cabot"). The purchase price for the acquisition (the "Cabot Acquisition") was $1.469 billion, which was paid through the assumption of approximately $229.8 million of mortgage debt and the remainder in cash. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition consideration through a combination of proceeds from an August 2013 offering of common shares, proceeds from a September 2013 offering of senior notes and draws under its credit facility. Pursuant to the purchase of Cabot, the Company acquired a 100% ownership interest in 177 industrial assets totaling approximately 23.0 million square feet. These assets are located in 24 markets.  Also consistent with its strategy, on November 7, 2013, the Company entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell a real estate portfolio which included the Company's Jacksonville, Florida portfolio in its entirety, all of the office properties and certain land parcels in Maryland, Southern New Jersey and the Fort Washington suburb of Philadelphia and flex properties in Minnesota for a purchase price of $697.3 million (the "Portfolio Sale"). The properties consisted of 97 buildings containing an aggregate of 6.6 million square feet. On December 24, 2013, the Company closed on the first of two planned settlements under this agreement. The proceeds from the first settlement were $367.7 million and included 49 properties containing approximately 4.0 million square feet of space and 140 acres of land. The remaining 48 properties containing an aggregate of 2.6 million square feet and 19 acres of land were sold for $329.6 million in January 2014.  Due to long-term trends that the Company believes favor industrial properties and indicate potential erosion in value of suburban office properties, the Company has increased its investment in industrial and metro-office properties and decreased its investment in suburban office properties. The short-term effect of these activities has been a decrease in net cash from operating activities, as rental income related to the Company's industrial properties is less than that from the Company's suburban office properties, assuming similar amounts invested. The Company anticipates that over time it will realize the benefits of these activities, including a higher rate of rental growth and a lower level of transaction costs for industrial properties as opposed to suburban office properties. For 2014, in the aggregate, the net cash provided by operating activities, less customary capital expenditures and leasing transaction costs, was less than dividend distributions primarily due to the delay in the deployment of proceeds from the Portfolio Sale. The Company will continue to evaluate its dividend distribution policy in light of these circumstances.  Table of Contents  The Company's operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the Properties in Operation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, straight line rents on renewal and replacement leases were on average 2.1% higher than rents on expiring leases. The Company's guidance for 2015 contemplates an increase of straight line rent on average of 2% to 3%. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company successfully leased 25.0 million square feet and, as of that date, attained occupancy of 93.1% for the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation and 92.2% for the JV Properties in Operation for a combined occupancy of 93.0% for the Properties in Operation. At December 31, 2013, occupancy for the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation was 91.4% and for the JV Properties in Operation was 92.3% for a combined occupancy for the Properties in Operation of 91.6%. The Company's guidance for 2015 contemplates a increase in average occupancy of 1% to 2%.  Wholly Owned Capital Activity  Dispositions  Development  "Total Investment" for a Property Under Development is defined as the sum of the land costs and the costs of land improvements, building and building improvements, lease transaction costs, and where appropriate, other development costs and carrying costs.  Unconsolidated Joint Venture Activity  Additionally, joint ventures in which the Company held a 20% interest began development on the Comcast Innovation & Technology Center, which is expected to comprise, upon completion, 1.3 million square feet of office space and a 222-room Four Seasons Hotel and is expected to represent a Total Investment of $921 million. See Note 7 to the Company's financial statements.  Table of Contents  Forward-Looking Statements  Table of Contents  The capitalized above or below-market lease values are amortized as a component of rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and any bargain renewal option periods, where appropriate. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Table of Contents  are based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including, among others, demand for space, competition for tenants, current market rental rates, changes in market rental rates, operating costs, capitalization rates, holding periods and discount rates. For these assumptions, the Company considered its experience and historical performance in the various markets and data provided by market research organizations. In assessing whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers several factors. The longevity and severity of the impairment are considered as well as the expected time for recovery of value to occur, if ever.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 the Kings Hill Unit Trust joint venture recorded an impairment charge. The Company's share of this impairment charge was $0.8 million and is reflected in equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the Company's 2013 consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  During the year ended December 31, 2012 the Blythe Valley JV Sarl joint venture recorded an impairment charge, the Company's share of which was sufficient to bring the Company's investment in the joint venture to zero. The Company's share of this impairment charge was $4.6 million and is reflected in equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the Company's 2012 consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of net income or as a component of other comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. Results of Operations  This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.

About the TCA
Founded in 1986, the Tilt-Up Concrete Association (TCA) strives to improve the quality and acceptance of site-cast Tilt-Up construction, a method in which concrete wall panels are cast on-site and tilted into place. Tilt-Up construction is one of the fastest growing industries in the United States, combining the advantages of reasonable cost with low maintenance, durability, speed of construction and minimal capital investment. At least 10,000 buildings, enclosing more than 650 million square feet, are constructed each year using this construction method.
