PNEUMATI-CON® Dilute Phase Pneumatic Conveying Systems
Flexicon's PNEUMATI-CON dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems range from single-point "up-and-in" installations to cross-plant systems with multiple pick-up and discharge points and automated controls, satisfying an exceptionally wide range of bulk conveying applications. All are custom-engineered and fully integrated with other Flexicon equipment and systems, and your new or existing process.
PNEUMATI-CON dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems move bulk materials that are suspended in an air stream that is introduced by a positive pressure blower upstream of material intake points, or by a vacuum pump that removes air from the system downstream of material discharge points. Material is separated from the conveying air at the use point, then discharged on a batch basis via butterfly or slide gate valves, or continuously via rotary airlock valves.





 


Easy conveyor line routing
Since conveyor lines can be routed vertically and in any horizontal direction, over short or long distances, through small holes in walls or ceilings, Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON systems are easy to integrate into production environments in which process equipment and other obstacles often exist, while consuming minimal floor space.


Diversity of products handled by one conveyor
Powders having wide ranging bulk densities, as well as flakes, pellets, capsules, tablets and other friable materials, can be handled by a single Flexicon pneumatic conveyor, providing the flexibility needed to transport multiple ingredients.


 


Total evacuation
PNEUMATI-CON systems fully evacuate the vessel being discharged and the conveyor line itself, minimizing cross-contamination of multi-ingredient systems. Complete transfer of material also ensures that individual and consolidated batch ingredients reach their destinations accurately by weight, maximizing quality while minimizing waste.


Wide capacity range
With a PNEUMATI-CON conveyor, capacity can range from several pounds to tens of tons per hour, feeding any destination from small packaging lines to silos and railcars. Moreover, excessive fluctuations in the feed rate — resulting in overloading or underloading — will not damage the system.


 


Enclosed system prevents contamination
Totally enclosed and dust-free, a PNEUMATI-CON conveying system prevents contamination of the product and plant environment, allowing safe transfer of contamination-sensitive materials including dusty and hazardous products.


High reliability and ease of maintenance
Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON systems feature easy-to-maintain filter receivers with access doors and inspection ports, as well as rotary airlock valves with optional rotor support bars for easy access, cleaning and inspection.


 


Mobile and custom configurations
Self-contained Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON conveying  systems complete with feed hopper and/or pick-up wand, blower unit, filter receiver and control package, are available pre-engineered and configured on caster-mounted frames for in-plant mobility.



Designed, constructed and finished to industrial and sanitary standards
PNEUMATI-CON conveying systems are available in carbon steel with durable industrial finishes, or stainless steel finished to standards required for industrial, food, dairy and pharmaceutical applications. Available upgrades include quick-access and quick-disconnect fitments.

SYSTEM TYPES


Positive pressure systems
Positive pressure dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are typically employed to convey bulk materials from a single source to one or multiple destinations, over longer distances and with greater capacity than possible using vacuum systems.
These systems utilize a positive displacement blower with single or multiple downstream material entry points, each of which meters product into conveying lines by means of a rotary airlock valve that maintains the pressure differential between the ambient atmosphere and that of the conveying line. Material and air blown through the line exit at single or multiple use points where they are separated by means of a filter receiver or cyclone  separator, or fed directly into process vessels that are vented to downstream dust collection devices.
Pressure systems offer higher efficiency than vacuum systems, can convey over longer distances, and can blow directly into process and storage vessels without the use of a rotary airlock valve.


Vacuum systems
Vacuum dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are generally employed for transporting material from multiple sources such as storage vessels, process equipment, trucks and railcars, to individual or multiple destinations. Unlike positive pressure systems, vacuum systems allow easy pick-up of materials from open containers using  wands, and do not impart heat to the material. Since vacuum systems offer superior leak containment, they are often specified on the basis of cleanliness, particularly when handling hazardous materials.
Negative pressure is created by a positive displacement vacuum pump located at the downstream end of the system. Material typically enters the system via upstream rotary airlock valves, hand-held pick-up wands, and non-flow-through/flood-feed pick-up adapters, and exits the system through filter receivers or cyclone separators that separate the material from the conveying air directly above process equipment, surge hoppers, storage vessels or other discharge points.
In addition, vacuum conveying is suited to direct feeding of blenders, reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are put under vacuum by a line terminating at a downstream bag house or other dust collection device, eliminating the need for individual filter receivers or cyclone separators above each discharge point.



 



COMPONENTS
A complete range of pneumatic system components


Flexicon provides any and all components necessary to configure your PNEUMATI-CON system including:



Flex-tube diverters, wye-diverters, plug diverters and other line diverter configurations
Rotary airlock valves in all popular designs and sizes
Filter receivers for low- to high-capacity applications







Cyclone separators for low- to high-capacity applications
Gain-in-weight and loss-of-weight batching systems
Dust collectors and bin vents
Controls and electrical equipment
Hand-held pick-up wands
Silos, day bins and other storage vessels

 

Bag Dump Stations
Flexicon's Sanitary Bag Dump Station collects dust created during manual dumping of bulk materials from bags, boxes, drums and other containers, and allows rapid, tool-free wash down. Optional rocker arms support the hood assembly above the hopper rim, eliminating the need for operators to lift and remove the hood during cleaning and inspection. Shown with quick-clean rotary airlock.




Storage Vessels
Flexicon storage vessels in carbon steel with durable coatings (shown) and in stainless steel are available equipped with flow promotion devices and rotary airlock valves for consistent metering of bulk material into positive pressure or vacuum pneumatic conveyor lines. With optional load cells and programmable controls, vessels can serve as loss-of-weight batching systems.


 






Inlet Hoppers
Sanitary stainless steel inlet hopper is gravity-fed from upstream process equipment or storage vessels. A sanitary stainless steel rotary airlock valve at the hopper discharge can be equipped with optional support rails that allow the rotor assembly to separate from the valve body for sanitizing of all material contact surfaces, and to close securely in seconds — tool-free.


 






Filter Receivers
PNEUMATI-CON filter receivers incorporate numerous design and construction innovations offering unsurpassed separation efficiency across all capacity ranges. Low-capacity units are commonly positioned above packaging lines or smaller process equipment, while medium capacity units are utilized above storage vessels and process equipment such as blenders and bulk bag fillers.


 






Silo Vents
This Silo Vent is essentially the upper section of a filter receiver that can be mounted atop an existing silo or other large vessel, into which material can be conveyed.









Vacuum Receivers
This modular vacuum receiver features a rugged clamp-together design that facilitates rapid disassembly for filter maintenance and cleaning. Whereas conventional filter receivers employ multiple smaller elements, it employs a single, large diameter filter cartridge, and offers an ideal solution for low-throughput-rate, short-distance pneumatic conveying applications.


 






Cyclone Separators
Unlike filter receivers, cyclone separators require no filters to separate solid particles from the gas stream, instead relying on cyclonic action alone. An air stream containing material enters the separator at a tangential angle and is spun rapidly, creating a circular flow that imparts centrifugal force to the particles which strike the wall of the cyclone and fall through a bottom outlet, into a process vessel.



 



MATERIAL INTAKE METHODS
Pressure and vacuum conveying systems commonly utilize rotary airlock valves to introduce material to the air stream. Hand-held wands and non-flow-through (flood-feed) pick-up adapters can be utilized with vacuum systems.


 


Rotary Airlock Valves with Flow-Through Pick-Up Adapters
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pick-up adapters can be utilized in pressure and vacuum systems for both controlled metering of material into the conveying system, and maintaining the pressure differential between the conveying system and ambient atmosphere.





 



Wands
(Vacuum systems)
Hand-held pick-up wands plumbed to vacuum conveyor lines with flexible hose are used to vacuum material from Gaylords, drums, paper bags, barrels or other containers.





 



Non-Flow-Through (Flood-Feed) Pick-Up Adapters
(Vacuum systems)
Material can be introduced into vacuum conveyor lines via non-flow-through (flood-feed) pick-up adapters, which are typically used at pick-up points where lower volumes of material are fed manually.





 



Material pick-up points, clockwise from top left, include hand-held pick-up wand, rotary airlock with flow-through adapter, non-flow-through pick-up adapter, and rotary airlock with flow-through pick-up adapter.























 



MATERIAL DISCHARGE METHODS
Material typically exits pressure and vacuum pneumatic conveyors via filter receivers or cyclone separators, or discharges directly into process or storage vessels. Positive pressure systems can additionally employ fill/pass valves to discharge material from the system at one use point, or redirect the material to another use point.


 


Directly into Process Vessels
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Both pressure and vacuum systems can feed material directly into blenders, reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are vented to a downstream bag house or other dust collection device, eliminating the need for individual filter receivers.





 



Filter Receivers
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Flexicon filter receivers separate solids from the air stream using filter media and gravity, and are generally specified when materials contain smaller particles that are prone to dusting and/or when dust containment is a primary requirement. They are normally located above material use points, and employ reverse-pulse jet filter cleaning to dislodge accumulated dust from filter surfaces, allowing continuous and efficient separation of material from the air stream.





 



Cyclone Separators
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Cyclones separate solids from the conveyor air stream using centrifugal force and gravity, and are typically specified when materials are comprised of larger particle sizes that are not prone to dusting. Although filters are uncommon, they can be incorporated as a secondary means of capturing airborne solids.





 



Fill/Pass Valves 
(Pressure systems)
Fill/pass valves are commonly used to discharge material directly into individual or multiple process vessels and/or to deliver it to several destinations along a common conveying line. Downstream of the last fill/pass valve, the conveying line is normally routed to the original material source point or into a dust collection device.

ATSG Subsidiary Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services to Acquire PEMCO World Air Services
WILMINGTON, OH – January 3, 2017 – Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) today said its subsidiary, Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. (AMES), has acquired PEMCO World Air Services, Inc. (PEMCO), a privately held provider of outsourced heavy maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) aircraft services and passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversions based in Tampa, FL. The company did not assume any PEMCO debt in connection with the acquisition.
        This acquisition will allow for a number of strategic benefits through combining operational strengths, expanded capabilities and cost savings related to shared services between the companies. The services of the combined AMES/PEMCO businesses will be marketed worldwide to customers as part of a comprehensive set of ATSG solutions, as well as to the ATSG affiliates.
        Services will be offered from multiple locations, including Wilmington and Tampa for heavy maintenance and modifications, and Tampa, Central America and Asia for passenger-to-freighter conversions. Additional service offerings of aircraft-on-ground field teams, line and turnaround maintenance, component repair and overhaul, engineering repair and design, and extensive manufacturing and kitting capabilities, will be extended from various locations. 
        ATSG President and CEO Joe Hete said, “Based on PEMCO’s existing domestic and international scale, this acquisition will expand access to maintenance service for customers of ATSG’s expanding fleet of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft. It is consistent with our goal to diversify ATSG’s revenue and earnings, for an investment in the same price range as our planned and completed stakes in cargo airlines in China and Europe. The combination of PEMCO’s conversion and MRO sales of both Airbus and Boeing products with AMES’ existing offerings will create a sustained, growth-oriented aircraft maintenance product and services portfolio.” 
        Hete added that based on ATSG’s current estimates and outlook, the PEMCO acquisition is expected to be accretive to ATSG’s earnings starting in 2017.
        Advisers to PEMCO included Canaccord Genuity Inc. as financial adviser and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP as legal adviser. Advisers to ATSG included Vorys, Sater, Seymour & Pease LLP as legal adviser.

PEMCO-converted aircraft make up more than 70 percent of China-based B737-300 and -400 fleets in service. The company has redelivered over 50 B737-300 and B737-400 converted aircraft to Chinese operators since 2006, including the first B737-300F aircraft in China.

                Joe Hete is president and CEO of Air Transport Services Group.            






Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services Inc., a subsidiary of Wilmington-based Air Transport Services Group Inc. (Nasdaq: ATSG), has acquired PEMCO World Air Services Inc.
Financial details of the deal weren’t disclosed except that ATSG and AMES will not assume any PEMCO debt in connection with the acquisition.

Tampa-based PEMCO is a privately held provider of outsourced heavy vehicle maintenance, repair and overhaul aircraft services and passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversions.
The deal is expected to provide benefits including combined operational strengths, expanded capabilities and cost savings related to shared services.
“Based on PEMCO’s existing domestic and international scale, this acquisition will expand access to maintenance service for customers of ATSG’s expanding fleet of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft,” ATSG president and CEO Joe Hete said in a statement. “It is consistent with our goal to diversify ATSG’s revenue and earnings for an investment in the same price range as our planned and completed stakes in cargo airlines in China and Europe. The combination of PEMCO’s conversion and MRO sales of both Airbus and Boeing products with AMES’ existing offerings will create a sustained, growth-oriented aircraft maintenance product and services portfolio.”
Wilmington and Tampa will house heavy maintenance and modifications, while Tampa, Central America and Asia will be home to passenger-to-freighter conversions. Aircraft-on-ground field teams, line and turnaround maintenance, component repair and overhaul, engineering repair and design, and extensive manufacturing and kitting capabilities will be based in various locations.
The acquisition is expected to be accretive to ATSG’s earnings in 2017.




 


Canaccord Genuity Inc. served as PEMCO’s financial adviser, while Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP was its legal adviser. Vorys, Sater, Seymour & Pease LLP was legal adviser for PEMCO.
AMES provides one-stop aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul in Wilmington, Cincinnati and Miami. It’s a wholly owned subsidiary of ATSG, which provides aircraft leasing, air cargo transportation and related services.

PNEUMATI-CON® Dilute Phase Pneumatic Conveying Systems
Flexicon's PNEUMATI-CON dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems range from single-point "up-and-in" installations to cross-plant systems with multiple pick-up and discharge points and automated controls, satisfying an exceptionally wide range of bulk conveying applications. All are custom-engineered and fully integrated with other Flexicon equipment and systems, and your new or existing process.
PNEUMATI-CON dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems move bulk materials that are suspended in an air stream that is introduced by a positive pressure blower upstream of material intake points, or by a vacuum pump that removes air from the system downstream of material discharge points. Material is separated from the conveying air at the use point, then discharged on a batch basis via butterfly or slide gate valves, or continuously via rotary airlock valves.





 


Easy conveyor line routing
Since conveyor lines can be routed vertically and in any horizontal direction, over short or long distances, through small holes in walls or ceilings, Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON systems are easy to integrate into production environments in which process equipment and other obstacles often exist, while consuming minimal floor space.


Diversity of products handled by one conveyor
Powders having wide ranging bulk densities, as well as flakes, pellets, capsules, tablets and other friable materials, can be handled by a single Flexicon pneumatic conveyor, providing the flexibility needed to transport multiple ingredients.


 


Total evacuation
PNEUMATI-CON systems fully evacuate the vessel being discharged and the conveyor line itself, minimizing cross-contamination of multi-ingredient systems. Complete transfer of material also ensures that individual and consolidated batch ingredients reach their destinations accurately by weight, maximizing quality while minimizing waste.


Wide capacity range
With a PNEUMATI-CON conveyor, capacity can range from several pounds to tens of tons per hour, feeding any destination from small packaging lines to silos and railcars. Moreover, excessive fluctuations in the feed rate — resulting in overloading or underloading — will not damage the system.


 


Enclosed system prevents contamination
Totally enclosed and dust-free, a PNEUMATI-CON conveying system prevents contamination of the product and plant environment, allowing safe transfer of contamination-sensitive materials including dusty and hazardous products.


High reliability and ease of maintenance
Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON systems feature easy-to-maintain filter receivers with access doors and inspection ports, as well as rotary airlock valves with optional rotor support bars for easy access, cleaning and inspection.


 


Mobile and custom configurations
Self-contained Flexicon PNEUMATI-CON conveying  systems complete with feed hopper and/or pick-up wand, blower unit, filter receiver and control package, are available pre-engineered and configured on caster-mounted frames for in-plant mobility.



Designed, constructed and finished to industrial and sanitary standards
PNEUMATI-CON conveying systems are available in carbon steel with durable industrial finishes, or stainless steel finished to standards required for industrial, food, dairy and pharmaceutical applications. Available upgrades include quick-access and quick-disconnect fitments.

SYSTEM TYPES


Positive pressure systems
Positive pressure dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are typically employed to convey bulk materials from a single source to one or multiple destinations, over longer distances and with greater capacity than possible using vacuum systems.
These systems utilize a positive displacement blower with single or multiple downstream material entry points, each of which meters product into conveying lines by means of a rotary airlock valve that maintains the pressure differential between the ambient atmosphere and that of the conveying line. Material and air blown through the line exit at single or multiple use points where they are separated by means of a filter receiver or cyclone  separator, or fed directly into process vessels that are vented to downstream dust collection devices.
Pressure systems offer higher efficiency than vacuum systems, can convey over longer distances, and can blow directly into process and storage vessels without the use of a rotary airlock valve.


Vacuum systems
Vacuum dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are generally employed for transporting material from multiple sources such as storage vessels, process equipment, trucks and railcars, to individual or multiple destinations. Unlike positive pressure systems, vacuum systems allow easy pick-up of materials from open containers using  wands, and do not impart heat to the material. Since vacuum systems offer superior leak containment, they are often specified on the basis of cleanliness, particularly when handling hazardous materials.
Negative pressure is created by a positive displacement vacuum pump located at the downstream end of the system. Material typically enters the system via upstream rotary airlock valves, hand-held pick-up wands, and non-flow-through/flood-feed pick-up adapters, and exits the system through filter receivers or cyclone separators that separate the material from the conveying air directly above process equipment, surge hoppers, storage vessels or other discharge points.
In addition, vacuum conveying is suited to direct feeding of blenders, reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are put under vacuum by a line terminating at a downstream bag house or other dust collection device, eliminating the need for individual filter receivers or cyclone separators above each discharge point.



 



COMPONENTS
A complete range of pneumatic system components


Flexicon provides any and all components necessary to configure your PNEUMATI-CON system including:



Flex-tube diverters, wye-diverters, plug diverters and other line diverter configurations
Rotary airlock valves in all popular designs and sizes
Filter receivers for low- to high-capacity applications







Cyclone separators for low- to high-capacity applications
Gain-in-weight and loss-of-weight batching systems
Dust collectors and bin vents
Controls and electrical equipment
Hand-held pick-up wands
Silos, day bins and other storage vessels

 

Bag Dump Stations
Flexicon's Sanitary Bag Dump Station collects dust created during manual dumping of bulk materials from bags, boxes, drums and other containers, and allows rapid, tool-free wash down. Optional rocker arms support the hood assembly above the hopper rim, eliminating the need for operators to lift and remove the hood during cleaning and inspection. Shown with quick-clean rotary airlock.




Storage Vessels
Flexicon storage vessels in carbon steel with durable coatings (shown) and in stainless steel are available equipped with flow promotion devices and rotary airlock valves for consistent metering of bulk material into positive pressure or vacuum pneumatic conveyor lines. With optional load cells and programmable controls, vessels can serve as loss-of-weight batching systems.


 






Inlet Hoppers
Sanitary stainless steel inlet hopper is gravity-fed from upstream process equipment or storage vessels. A sanitary stainless steel rotary airlock valve at the hopper discharge can be equipped with optional support rails that allow the rotor assembly to separate from the valve body for sanitizing of all material contact surfaces, and to close securely in seconds — tool-free.


 






Filter Receivers
PNEUMATI-CON filter receivers incorporate numerous design and construction innovations offering unsurpassed separation efficiency across all capacity ranges. Low-capacity units are commonly positioned above packaging lines or smaller process equipment, while medium capacity units are utilized above storage vessels and process equipment such as blenders and bulk bag fillers.


 






Silo Vents
This Silo Vent is essentially the upper section of a filter receiver that can be mounted atop an existing silo or other large vessel, into which material can be conveyed.









Vacuum Receivers
This modular vacuum receiver features a rugged clamp-together design that facilitates rapid disassembly for filter maintenance and cleaning. Whereas conventional filter receivers employ multiple smaller elements, it employs a single, large diameter filter cartridge, and offers an ideal solution for low-throughput-rate, short-distance pneumatic conveying applications.


 






Cyclone Separators
Unlike filter receivers, cyclone separators require no filters to separate solid particles from the gas stream, instead relying on cyclonic action alone. An air stream containing material enters the separator at a tangential angle and is spun rapidly, creating a circular flow that imparts centrifugal force to the particles which strike the wall of the cyclone and fall through a bottom outlet, into a process vessel.



 



MATERIAL INTAKE METHODS
Pressure and vacuum conveying systems commonly utilize rotary airlock valves to introduce material to the air stream. Hand-held wands and non-flow-through (flood-feed) pick-up adapters can be utilized with vacuum systems.


 


Rotary Airlock Valves with Flow-Through Pick-Up Adapters
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pick-up adapters can be utilized in pressure and vacuum systems for both controlled metering of material into the conveying system, and maintaining the pressure differential between the conveying system and ambient atmosphere.





 



Wands
(Vacuum systems)
Hand-held pick-up wands plumbed to vacuum conveyor lines with flexible hose are used to vacuum material from Gaylords, drums, paper bags, barrels or other containers.





 



Non-Flow-Through (Flood-Feed) Pick-Up Adapters
(Vacuum systems)
Material can be introduced into vacuum conveyor lines via non-flow-through (flood-feed) pick-up adapters, which are typically used at pick-up points where lower volumes of material are fed manually.





 



Material pick-up points, clockwise from top left, include hand-held pick-up wand, rotary airlock with flow-through adapter, non-flow-through pick-up adapter, and rotary airlock with flow-through pick-up adapter.























 



MATERIAL DISCHARGE METHODS
Material typically exits pressure and vacuum pneumatic conveyors via filter receivers or cyclone separators, or discharges directly into process or storage vessels. Positive pressure systems can additionally employ fill/pass valves to discharge material from the system at one use point, or redirect the material to another use point.


 


Directly into Process Vessels
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Both pressure and vacuum systems can feed material directly into blenders, reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are vented to a downstream bag house or other dust collection device, eliminating the need for individual filter receivers.





 



Filter Receivers
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Flexicon filter receivers separate solids from the air stream using filter media and gravity, and are generally specified when materials contain smaller particles that are prone to dusting and/or when dust containment is a primary requirement. They are normally located above material use points, and employ reverse-pulse jet filter cleaning to dislodge accumulated dust from filter surfaces, allowing continuous and efficient separation of material from the air stream.





 



Cyclone Separators
(Pressure and vacuum systems)
Cyclones separate solids from the conveyor air stream using centrifugal force and gravity, and are typically specified when materials are comprised of larger particle sizes that are not prone to dusting. Although filters are uncommon, they can be incorporated as a secondary means of capturing airborne solids.





 



Fill/Pass Valves 
(Pressure systems)
Fill/pass valves are commonly used to discharge material directly into individual or multiple process vessels and/or to deliver it to several destinations along a common conveying line. Downstream of the last fill/pass valve, the conveying line is normally routed to the original material source point or into a dust collection device.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
