What Being An Injury Advocate Means to Brian
 Helping injured people obtain justice from big corporations when they manufacture dangerous products that cause injuries due to placing profit over safety. Helping accident victims collect what they are due from insurance companies that believe they are solely in business to collect premiums, as opposed to the business of paying valid claims. The satisfaction of helping someone recover their life after an accident or injury, especially one from the wrongdoing of others.

Client Reviews of Bisnar Chase“My grandson and I were involved in a roll-over accident in which he broke his ankle, and I broke my neck. Unfortunately it was caused by a hit and run driver who got away. One call to Bisnar/Chase and they came right away. Of course, my case took about 3 years to settle, but Bisnar/Chase was there to inform me every step of the way as to what was going on. They answer calls and emails right away, and I was never left wondering what was going on. The whole staff is caring and friendly and everyone there treated us like family. Not to mention the fact that they never seemed to forget you, by sending birthday cards with BaskinRobbin gift cards and on New Years they always sent the fancy fortune cookies! I always thought that was very thoughtful and caring of them. I had nothing but a positive experience with them and I would recommend Bisnar/Chase to all of my friends and family or to anyone who is in need of legal help.”by Kathy E.reviewed at Yelp on January 8th, 2015  (5/5)“I did a car accident case with these guys. They were quick, efficient and friendly. Ended up with a great settlement. Why did I get the royal treatment? No idea.”by Jacob C.reviewed at Yelp on November 29th, 2011  (5/5)“Recently, I had to find a personal injury attorney on a case that had special circumstances. I had a car accident that is almost due to expire and unfortunately, in the beginning,  I decided no [sic] to get an attorney. And oh boy am I regretting it. 

							I didn't have a lot of respect for lawyers before this. And because of that, I made the decision not to represent myself two years ago.

							Altho [sic] they were not able to help me, Mr. Bisnar was so helpful that he directed me in a manner that I didn't need an attorney at all. He was funny and charming. It was my fault for not going the standard route, but next time, I will definitely not hesitate to contact these attorneys for any of my legal needs. 

							I was VERY impressed. I don't use those words lightly (especially about attorneys!) so this is no bull! neither was Mr. Bisnar of Bisnar and Chase.”by Morgana Rreviewed at Yelp  (4/5)

Client Reviews of Bisnar Chase“Like Danielle, I have been waiting a long time to review Bisnar  Chase too.  My review is a little different, however.  I have only experienced a friendly staff (especially the receptionist Loraine) that treats everyone of their clients like they are movie stars.  If I had a friend that was in an accident these guys would be the first people I would send them to.”by Chris O.reviewed at Yelp on June 5th, 2011  (4/5)“I wanted to wait to put this up until I receive my check. I had a great experience with this firm. My attorney did a great job and I had a great result. I dont know of they are different than they used to be, but they were exactly what I was looking for.”by James G.reviewed at Yelp on December 15th, 2011  (5/5)“I was in an accident and it was the other persons fault. I call [sic] Bisnar Chase and they came to my door and took down all the information to get the case going. Not only did they do a fantastic job during the whole process, they got me a little more money too. ;) Thank you Bisnar Chase and Staff for your help. It truly has made a difference.”by Thomas Arcalareviewed at Facebook  (5/5)
