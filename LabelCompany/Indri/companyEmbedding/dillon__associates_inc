We believe selecting investments is an entrepreneurial process, and our long-term record is possible because our approach and ideas do not reflect the "group" psychology of the investment community.































Our Philosophy:Investment PerspectiveEvery firm has its own philosophy of business, a set of principles that governs the way it conducts its affairs.  This is most important in the investment counseling profession where knowledge, judgment, foresight and perspective are key ingredients to a successful and continuing relationship.  We believe successful long-term investing is based on the growth of value made possible by economic expansion and corporate innovation, both of which are likely to continue.The world economy will expand and advance in the future, as it has in the past.  More goods and services will be needed to meet the ever-expanding world population.  Higher demand will inevitably lead to advances in technology and research, creating new products, adding jobs, increasing productivity and building economic wealth.Inflation will remain a key factor for all investors.  The value of the dollar has declined for over fifty consecutive years.  Even at 3% inflation, the value of the dollar will decline to 23 cents over an average investment lifetime of fifty years, and by one-fourth every ten years.Perspective is important, and patience necessary, in achieving long-term investment success.  We do not emphasize the short run, and we are unable to help those who follow an in-and-out trading approach.Investment SelectionWe conduct our own independent research.  We invest substantially each year to acquire outside expertise in the fields of economics, industry analysis, company research, taxation, law and political analysis.  Government statistics and brokerage research are also drawn upon for input into our studies.Our examination of investments is a fundamental analysis, and we are disciplined in our valuation judgments.  Our recommendations reflect an assessment of both the underlying investment merits of a security as well as its value relative to its opportunities and risks.We focus our efforts on those industries and companies that are capable of achieving above average results based on identifiable time-tested criteria.

liquidation sales. We have more than fifteen years of experience concentrating
on two types of sales: office buildings and department stores. The focus on just
two types of sales provides our clients and customers with increased knowledge
about the products we are selling. We are able to get a better return for our
clients, and a better price for our customers. Our field supervisors have been
with our firm for many...  read more years, and they work exclusively for our company in
conducting sales of this type. We are confident that they are the most capable
people in the industry. Since 1991, major corporations have benefited from our
specialization in providing investment recovery strategies in conjunction with
corporate office and/or department store downsizing, relocations, and closures.

surplus office furniture, equipment, and store fixtures. You can expect to find
a large variety of items at our sales. Sales at office buildings generally
include all types of office furniture such as desks, chairs, credenzas, book
cases, and file cabinets. They may also include equipment such as computers (and
peripherals), phone systems, copy machines, fax machines, typewriters, and much
more. At a department store liquidation sale, you may find store fixtures such
as garment racks, shelving (display and storage), and cash wraps; as well as

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Brasch-Dillon & Associates Inc, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Atlanta, GA and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Atlanta, GA. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
