Canvas Print Framing Options



Gallery Wrapped Canvas

All of our artwork comes gallery wrapped.  The image is stretched around the sides and stapled to the
                back of the wooden frame.  Your piece of art will be ready to hang, and will include an easy-to-use
                hanging kit.




Floating Frame

A little “armor for your art” that won‘t obscure the canvas.  Your canvas print is
                gallery wrapped and mounted to a 2" thick, elegant, black hard wood frame.  The art is inset, leaving a
                3/8" space between the art and frame, creating the illusion that your art is “floating.”




Standard Frame

Draw their eyes into the art with a classic frame.  Your canvas print will be gallery wrapped and then
                carefully encased with a contemporary black hard wood frame. Only available for select .75" thick
                    sizes.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
