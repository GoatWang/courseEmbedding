History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]
Operations and finances[edit]
Finances[edit]
For fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[19]
Board of Directors[edit]
Current members of the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino. [20]
Executive management[edit]
Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus. William P. Lauder is Executive Chairman. Fabrizio Freda is President and Chief Executive Officer.[21]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]

Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]

Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

On October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]
Operations and finances[edit]
Finances[edit]
For fiscal year 2016, the Estée Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion last year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[19]
Board of Directors[edit]
Current members of the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies Inc. are: Charlene Barshefsky, Rose Marie Bravo, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Fabrizio Freda, Paul J. Fribourg, Wei Sun Christianson, Mellody Hobson, Irvine Hockaday, Jane Lauder, Leonard A. Lauder, Ronald S. Lauder, William P. Lauder, Richard Parsons, Barry Sternlicht and Richard F. Zannino. [20]
Executive management[edit]
Leonard A. Lauder is Chairman Emeritus. William P. Lauder is Executive Chairman. Fabrizio Freda is President and Chief Executive Officer.[21]
Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

History[edit]
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph Lauder began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.
In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[7] In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors[citation needed]. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder.
Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called "Skin Supplies for Men", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.
In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the Company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly-traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins — the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[8]
Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based M•A•C Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth™. The Company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The renowned fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[9]
On November 17, 1995, The Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange, at $26.00 a share ($13.00 post-split). [10]
The Estée Lauder brand has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede was the first African American 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Estée Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[11] In 2015, Estée Lauder signed model and social media sensation Kendall Jenner to introduce a new generation of beauty enthusiasts to the brand. [12]
Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as The Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in Bumble & bumble, the trendy hair care salon, and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the Company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand. [13]
On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[14]

This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[15]
In 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.
In 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand renowned for its "Luxury Face Oil," and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. In 2015, the Company acquired Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[16]
In 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, their first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[17] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for USD$1.45 billion.[18]

Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA)[edit]
In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the "Pink Ribbon" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon.
Over $10 million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1 million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003.[22]

Controversies[edit]
SOPA[edit]
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[28][29]
Child labor[edit]
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands.[citation needed] The company immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, claiming it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.
Other[edit]
Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]
Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign. The boycott has been led by pro-Palestinian activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[30][31] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their "Estée Slaughter" campaign.[32] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[33]
Animal testing[edit]
The Estée Lauder Companies performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. The Estée Lauder Companies does perform animal testing where required by law. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[34] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand. Customers are concerned that by continuing to purchase from these previously cruelty free brands that they may contributing to animal testing via parent companies.

William P. Lauder
President & CEO, The Estée Lauder Companies


  William P. Lauder is President and Chief Executive Officer of The Estée
  Lauder Companies Inc. The Estée Lauder Companies is recognized as a
  global premium consumer goods company by the investment community and is one
  of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup,
  fragrance and hair care products, with annual sales of more than $6.5 billion.
  Its products are sold in more than 130 markets under 26 well-recognized brand
  names.

  Mr. Lauder became President and Chief Executive Officer of The Estée
  Lauder Companies on July 1, 2004. He was previously Chief Operating Officer
  of the Company, and was responsible for the oversight of all of the Company's
  Global Operations, including Manufacturing, Research & Development and
  Human Resources, as well as Retail Store Operations and all activities for
  The Estée Lauder Companies' International business. In addition,
  he oversaw nine of the Company's specialty brands, including Bobbi Brown,
  Prescriptives and Aveda. 

  Prior to that, Mr. Lauder was President of Clinique Worldwide and Group President
  of The Estée Lauder Companies. In this role, he led the worldwide businesses
  of Clinique and Origins, and the Retail Division of the Company, which encompassed
  the management of freestanding stores for all brands, including Aveda, Origins
  and M•A•C. Additionally, he directed the Company's online
  activities on a worldwide basis, including the Gloss.com joint venture with
  Chanel and Clarins.

  Under his leadership, Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing
  Lotion became the best-selling prestige skin care product in U.S. department
  stores, and Clinique launched its first anti-aging product, Stop Signs Visible

  market share in the hair care category, spearheading the launch of the Clinique
  Simple Hair Care System. He also supervised the Clinique.com website as a marketing
  and brand-enhancing vehicle.

  From 1990 to 1998, Mr. Lauder served first as Vice President/General Manager
  and later as President of Origins Natural Resources Inc., where he led the
  introduction and development of this lifestyle brand. Under his leadership,
  Origins created the innovative store-within-a-store concept and achieved the
  highest growth rate of prestige cosmetic companies in the U.S.

  Mr. Lauder joined The Estée Lauder Companies in 1986 as Regional Marketing
  Director of Clinique U.S.A. in the New York Metro area. Mr. Lauder then spent
  two years at Prescriptives as Field Sales Manager. Prior to joining The Estée
  Lauder Companies, he completed Macy's executive training program in New
  York City and was Associate Merchandising Manager of the New York Division/Dallas
  store at the time of its opening in September 1985.

  Mr. Lauder is a member of the Board of Trustees of The University of Pennsylvania
  and the Boards of Directors of the Fresh Air Fund, the 92nd Street Y, Trinity
  School, Survivors of the SHOAH Visual History Foundation and the Partnership
  for New York City. He is also a member of the Board of The Estée Lauder
  Companies Inc. and True Temper Sports Inc. A graduate of the Wharton School
  of the University of Pennsylvania, he also studied at the University of Grenoble
  in France. An avid golfer, skier, tennis player and hiker, he lives in the
  aisle seat of an airplane, while his wife and children reside in New York City.

The Estée StoryA Family in Business















            A Family in Business
          




In 1946, Estée and Joseph Lauder founded Estée Lauder Cosmetics. The couple had two sons, Leonard and Ronald, and the family business was often the topic of discussion at the dinner table. By 1960, after years of hard work and ingenuity, the Lauders were on their way — from a mom-and-pop operation to becoming one of the most influential names in the beauty industry.
Seventy years since its creation, second- and-third-generation members of the Lauder family remain at the heart of the publicly traded, family-controlled company, actively engaged in its leadership.










We each have our own lanes of authority and expertise.


William P. Lauder, on the Lauders of his generation
















                  Leonard A. Lauder
                





                      Chairman Emeritus
                    

Leonard A. Lauder helped his parents with the business while still in his teens, and formally joined the Company in 1958. He increased profits by focusing on innovative sales and marketing programs. Leonard initiated international expansion, created the first R&D laboratory and brought in professional management on every level. He served as President from 1972 to 1995, and he was also Chief Executive Officer from 1982 to 1999. Under his leadership, the Company launched many brands, including Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series and Origins, and it began expanding through acquisitions, including M·A·C, Bobbi Brown and Aveda in the mid-1990s. Leonard assumed the title of Chairman in 1995 when the Company went public, and he served in that role through June 2009. Today, as Chairman Emeritus, he is often referred to as “Chief Teaching Officer,” conducting brand equity seminars and educational immersion programs for Company talent from around the world. He is both an officer of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors.

He is credited with helping Clinique to become a profitable business, and he was instrumental in the creation of Prescriptives. Fluent in many languages, Ronald served as Chairman of Estee Lauder International from 1992 to 2002. He also served as a member of The Estée Lauder Companies’ Board of Directors from 1968 to 1986 and 1988 to 2009. He was re-elected to the Board in November 2016. Today, he remains Chairman of Clinique Laboratories and is an Executive Officer of the Company.

Philanthropy and the Arts
Beyond the beauty industry, the Lauder family has had a meaningful social impact through their generous support of the arts, education, health and other areas. Each family member is identified with numerous philanthropic causes as well as their collective support for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), founded by the late Evelyn H. Lauder. Their generosity has been recognized by many major cultural and medical institutions. While the Lauder Family’s charitable giving is separate from The Estée Lauder Companies’ corporate philanthropy, it is evident that the family’s compassion and citizenship have been instilled in the Company’s values and culture.

Estée Lauder




A visionary entrepreneur who believed all women could be beautiful, Estée Lauder instinctively understood the power of makeup and the importance of skin care. Her dedication to offer women the highest-quality cosmetics transformed the fledgling business she started in 1946 with four products into today’s global leader in prestige beauty.
Born Josephine Esther Mentzer to immigrant parents in Queens, New York, Estée Lauder got her start selling skin care products developed by her uncle, a chemist, in local beauty salons and hotels. She landed her first major order from Saks Fifth Avenue in 1947. She believed in the power of word of mouth, and sampling products was a cornerstone of her philosophy. She acted as a one-woman research department, pioneering personalized beauty consultations and Gift With Purchase promotions.
Estée Lauder also developed some of the most successful fragrances of all time, including Youth Dew, Aramis and Beautiful. Expanding upon her vision, five more innovative brands were launched during the next two decades — Aramis, Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series and Origins — all backed by iconic advertising campaigns and revolutionary marketing strategies.
She received many prestigious honors, including France’s Legion of Honor in 1978 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004. The American Society of Perfumers gave her its first Living Legend award. She traveled and entertained extensively and socialized with world leaders, Hollywood royalty and celebrities. She had homes in Manhattan, Long Island, Palm Beach, London and the south of France, drawing inspiration from each location.
When she retired in 1995, her greatest wish was fulfilled: having her children and grandchildren immersed in the family business. “Living the American dream has been intense, difficult work, but I couldn’t have hoped for a more satisfying life,” she wrote in her 1985 biography, Estée: A Success Story. “I believe that potential is unlimited — success depends on daring to act on dreams.”
Estée Lauder died in 2004 at age 95.





Joseph Lauder




Joseph Lauder was a co-founder of the Company in 1946 with his wife, Estée Lauder, and at the time they were the only employees. Joseph Lauder’s background had been in silks, buttons and textiles.
A native New Yorker born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Joseph met Josephine Esther Mentzer in Westchester County, near where her parents had a summer home. They married in 1930.
In the early days of the Company, Estée and Joseph developed skin care creams using a stove, and hand-delivered the products to their customers. As the Company grew, Mr. Lauder became in charge of the manufacturing operations and finances, while Estée oversaw product development, sales and marketing.
The Lauders traveled around the world for business and to socialize with friends including artists, world leaders, actors and social figures, among them the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The couple was also extremely philanthropic; Joseph Lauder was vice president of the family’s charitable organization, The Lauder Foundation. A lover of opera and the fine arts, he served on the board of the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy.
In 1983, the year he passed away, The Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management & International Studies at the University of Pennsylvania was created in his honor by his sons, Leonard and Ronald.

Over 7,500 children attend these schools today, and 2,500 children attend the summer camps. Over the years, the Foundation has educated more than 30,000 children in a region that was devoid of Jewish scholarship and has helped build thriving Jewish communities throughout this area. Mr. Lauder also created an International Student Exchange Program between Jewish high school students in New York and Vienna.

Evelyn H. Lauder




Evelyn H. Lauder (1936–2011) was the Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide for The Estée Lauder Companies. During her more than 50 years with the Company, she held many positions while contributing her invaluable insights about fashion trends, consumers' changing needs and new approaches to the development of innovative skin care, makeup and fragrance products. She also helped name the Clinique brand. As Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide for The Estée Lauder Companies, she led the development of the Company’s most globally successful fragrances, including the best-selling Beautiful and Pleasures.
She was perhaps best known to the public for her work in bringing global awareness to women’s health. Her personal experience with early-stage breast cancer in 1987 led her in 1992 to co-create — with Alexandra Penney of Self magazine — the now ubiquitous Pink Ribbon, recognized as the worldwide symbol of breast health. In conjunction, Mrs. Lauder launched The Estée Lauder Companies Breast Cancer Awareness (BCA) Campaign (bcacampaign.com). To date, the BCA Campaign has distributed more than 115 million ribbons and informational brochures worldwide. In 2000 she and the BCA Campaign launched its annual Global Landmarks Illumination Initiative, whereby historic landmarks are illuminated in pink lights during October to focus global attention on breast health. In 2010 the BCA Campaign illuminated 38 global historic landmarks within a 24-hour time frame and achieved the first-ever Guinness world record for “Most Landmarks Illuminated for a Cause in 24 Hours.” Included were the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel in India, the Tokyo Tower in Japan, the Hotel Majestic in France and the Empire State Building in New York City.
Mrs. Lauder was also Chairman of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF), which she founded in 1993. She was passionately committed to preventing breast cancer and finding a cure in her lifetime by funding the most innovative clinical and translational research at leading medical centers worldwide. Today, BCRF is the world’s largest private funder of breast cancer research and BCRF-funded investigators have been deeply involved in every major breakthrough in breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship.
In 1989, Mrs. Lauder initiated the fundraising drive that established the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. As the first breast and diagnostic center, it became a model for similar facilities around the world. The expanded Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center opened in September 2009 and is three times the size of its predecessor. It provides the most up-to-date breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, and outpatient treatment services and serves as a worldwide model for offering coordinated supportive services under one roof for one disease, a concept which has been replicated in other institutions and for other diseases.
Mrs. Lauder’s achievements have garnered global recognition. In 2002, she received France’s Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur. In June 2007, Mrs. Lauder received the prestigious 2007 Partners in Progress Award from the American Society of Clinical Oncology for her efforts to increase public awareness about cancer. In 1999 and 2007, she was featured in Crain’s New York Business magazine as one of New York’s 100 Most Influential Women in Business, and in 2008 she was nominated to the International Best Dressed List. In 2010, Mrs. Lauder received the Fashion Group International Humanitarian Award in recognition for her work with BCRF and her tireless efforts toward eradicating breast cancer. In October 2011, the Lauder family received the prestigious Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy for their longstanding commitment to philanthropy and public service.
Mrs. Lauder was a dedicated photographer, whose art has been represented in many public and private collections, including The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and leading medical facilities worldwide. She’s had two photography books published of her own work, The Seasons Observed and, An Eye for Beauty. Her photographs have been exhibited internationally, including the Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York City, Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco, Duran Exposiciones de Arte in Madrid, The Red Gate Gallery in Beijing and at the Galerie des Galeries at the Galeries Lafayette in Paris. Her most recent photography exhibition “Salon Beauties” opened at the Gagosian Gallery in London on September 29, 2011. In September 2006, Mrs. Lauder published her first cookbook, In Great Taste: Fresh, Simple Recipes for Eating and Living Well. All of Mrs. Lauder’s royalties from her books and exhibitions are donated to BCRF.
Evelyn Lauder passed away from complications of non-genetic ovarian cancer on November 12th, 2011. She is survived by her husband Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus of the Estée Lauder Companies; her son William, Executive Chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies; her son Gary, Managing Director of Lauder Partners LLC and his wife Laura, General Partner of Lauder Partners; and her five grandchildren.

Supports K@W's Leadership Content 


To William Lauder, any talk about consumers centers on the word “she.” About 95% of the customers of Estée Lauder — the cosmetics and beauty products giant founded by, and named after, Lauder’s grandmother, are women. 
“In my world, women are the dominant decision makers for what we do every day,” Lauder said during a recent Wharton Leadership Lecture. 
When Estée Lauder and husband Joseph founded the company in 1946, it grew through the power of touch — Estee’s ability to reach across the counter and, with a dab of lotion or the swipe of a lipstick, connect with the customer. Today, the women served by the company live in 140 different countries. From an initial four products, Estée Lauder has expanded into more than 25 brands, including Clinique, Origins, MAC and Bobbi Brown. The company reported $7.8 billion in sales in 2010, a 6% increase from 2009.







The business has remained family owned and several of Estée Lauder’s children and grandchildren now hold leadership roles. William Lauder served as CEO of Estée Lauder from 2004 until 2009, when, in a relative first for the company, the reins were passed to a non-family member, former Procter & Gamble executive Fabrizio Freda. Lauder remains executive chairman.
Although today’s retail landscape is much different than it was at the time of the company’s founding, with a greater range of choices for consumers and lower barriers to entry for companies, Estée Lauder has remained committed to selling in upscale department stores. Stylists behind the makeup counter add value to purchases by offering personalized advice to the customers. 
“Seventy percent of what we sell are products we launched more than three years ago,” Lauder said during his speech. “We’re spending 80% of our time on what’s new today, what’s coming in the next 18 to 24 months, but the consumer is spending seven out of 10 dollars on stuff from three years ago. What’s wrong with that picture? Nothing — she’s buying what we created three years ago again and again and again; she’s buying what works for her.”
In a recent interview with Knowledge@Wharton, Lauder discussed the benefits and challenges of working in a family-owned business, the company’s global growth aspirations and why, in the words of his grandmother, they key to success for Estée Lauder is “getting women to put their hands together.”
An edited version of the transcript appears below.
Knowledge@Wharton: Estée Lauder has always placed a great emphasis on sticking to its core values and keeping the heritage of the brand intact. Tell me a little bit about those core values and how they figure in to both day to day operations, and also decisions to expand and add new brands to your line.
William Lauder: We have a company of over 30,000 employees where we’re selling something every four seconds of every single day, 365 days of the year…. The fact of the matter is there are thousands of decisions being made every single day, and they’re not controlled by some central all-knowing, all-seeing organization…. [Our company is] all about great brands, great people and what is the right thing to do for the consumer to make her happy…. 
The hierarchy is an inverted pyramid, where the top of our organization [includes] the people who represent our brands to the consumer in stores around the world. They are the most important because they touch the consumer every day. It’s the consumer’s connection with them and with the brands that continues to make us successful.
Knowledge@Wharton: A recent New York Times story about the company mentioned that your grandmother tried to physically touch every consumer that came in, either by dabbing lotion on a her hand or giving a makeover. But there was also a discussion of the new Clinique counters that allow customers to choose products without having to interact with a salesperson. What does that say about how women have changed over the years?
Lauder: Many of the dynamics of how consumers shop today for their beauty products have remained the same for 20, 30, 40 years — and some aspects of their behaviors have changed dramatically. First of all, they have an extraordinary multiplicity of choice [today]. They have many different retail environments to choose from, and many different brands to choose from. 
The notion of convenience in shopping and how [consumers] stratify themselves according to shopping patterns has changed over time. For example, in the 1970s, the consumer who shopped in a very upscale, prestigious store like a Neiman Marcus would never consider shopping in a Walmart or in the Walmart of the day. Today, she thinks nothing of driving her Suburban to Neiman Marcus in the morning to buy that very fancy Prada outfit, having lunch with her friends, and then getting in her Suburban, going to Walmart and picking up the toilet paper that she needs because she knows it’s the best value. She doesn’t have a problem with that today. And she doesn’t think that says anything in a negative way about her. In fact, maybe she can even say, “I didn’t even shop Walmart, I shopped Costco.”
That’s just an example. As for our products themselves, we realize the consumer comes in very informed. She thinks she knows what she wants, but the expertise that somebody gets in the store — that hasn’t changed. The authority of that expert in the store — the Estée Lauder make-up artist, the Clinique consultant, the MAC make-up artist — this really hasn’t changed.


Knowledge@Wharton High School






That human touch was so important and [was] one of the key core principles around which our company was founded. This hasn’t changed. The fact of the matter is the consumer still wants and needs to be touched. [The customer appreciates] the expertise that she gets in helping to find the right product and she puts that into the value calculation she makes when [deciding on] a purchase. That’s a very important element of her behavior. Convenience is another issue. The notion of convenience has changed and not just because of what the Internet offers. [Online shopping] really doesn’t represent a meaningful [part] of her consumption in our category. It doesn’t represent a big, meaningful [portion of the overall market] for most retail — except for books and music and a few other categories where you can actually buy the equivalent online without having to go to a store.
[But in the case of beauty products,] consumers still want to see it, touch it, feel it, smell it. Technology does not allow that to be replaced, so she’s still willing to go to a store. The other thing is the notion of what shopping is about — that’s a behavioral pattern that hasn’t really changed. It’s still as much about entertainment as it is about an act of consumption. Many people can entertain themselves happily at home with different electronic gadgets. But many still want to get out and about and be in a social environment. They still like to shop in an environment like that. And then you add the interaction with an expert with whom they can talk. That behavior has only evolved a little bit, not a lot. We in the cosmetics business, for example, thrive on the fact that so many of our consumers, once they find the product that they love and they like, want to come back and buy it again and again. 
[Customers] want something new, but they also want the products that they like not to change, so they can use them again and again. The number one consumer feedback we get is “Bring [a certain item] back” when we’ve discontinued a product…. 
Knowledge@Wharton: In the Times story, you were quoted as saying that working for a family business means every member of the Board has your home phone number. They know where you live. What are some of the challenges and also the benefits of working for a company that, I would say at this point, is probably like another member of your family?
Lauder: There’s two definitions of “family.” There’s family that’s blood. And then there’s family that is everybody who belongs to the organization regardless of blood, who are also family in a way. You want to treat everybody the same in that respect. But you also want to treat them with respect and professionalism, which is such an important part of what we do. Our competitive advantage as a family company really is, and has been since our founding, the innovation and patience that has allowed us to maintain our leadership in our industry. Because of our patience in nurturing and developing new brands, nurturing and developing people, we’ve created an environment where we are the place to come for innovation. We’re the most innovative marketers. We’re the most innovative brand builders. We’re the most innovative on a retail basis. We have a passion for innovation and we have baked that into how we look at executives and their skill sets, but also how we succeed with the consumer….
We also have the patience to nurture new brands and new ideas, perhaps longer than companies that don’t have the same ownership structure.
Knowledge@Wharton: Conversely, what are some of the challenges of a family owned business?
Lauder: Many of the challenges of a family owned business are the same no matter what kind of business you’re in. You have family members who may have certain emotional opinions and biases, which may or may not be best based on rational thought. Sometimes those emotions are legitimate, and sometimes perhaps they’re based on ideas that did work at one point but perhaps are not as relevant today. In other words, [older family members might say,] “When I was your age, I did this or that.” The ability to say, “Gee, you know, I’m not so certain that might work right now,” isn’t so easy. That is the other side of what I talked about before, which was that we are very innovative and we have innovation as a part of what we do. But occasionally there are stakeholders who perhaps have the same last name as I do, who have a stake in the way it was, not necessarily the way it will be. It takes extra convincing for them to get there. That’s one of the issues. 
At the end of the day, I’d say we have more advantages than we have disadvantages. Even for our professional managers, there are those who, from a personality basis, fit within our organization and the psychological profile that it takes to be successful within our organization, and they’re really good. There are others who come along and who aren’t as successful, perhaps because they aren’t as comfortable in the family style environment. Perhaps they don’t have the same collaborative approach to what they do. But that’s [true in] almost any organization anywhere, regardless of the ownership structure. 
You have great personality fits, where people succeed because they fit within the organization well and they contribute so well with their peers. And you have others who aren’t as successful because they don’t fit within the psychological profile of the organization.
Knowledge@Wharton: In 2009, you decided to step down as CEO of Estée Lauder and now you serve as executive chairman. The company brought in a non-family member, former Procter & Gamble executive Fabrizio Freda, to serve as CEO. Tell me about some of the reasons why you made that decision. How has that changed your role? 
Lauder: Being a CEO of a public company today … is not quite what it’s all cracked up to be. And it can be a sentence — if you’re the CEO of a family company, if you’re not careful, it can be a life sentence. The fact of the matter is that it’s very hard work. It’s a great deal of time. It takes a great deal of energy…. I did not have a chief operating officer with whom I was working. So I was, if you will, doing a great deal myself…. 
When I looked at the roster of the most senior executives I had within my organization, I said, “Okay, fine, whom do I have who can be a long-term partner, a business operating partner with me to run this company?” As I asked that question I also said, “Let me take a survey of the outside to see if there are any executives who are perhaps not a part of our industry, not a part of our company, who might be able to add something different to the collective thought and wisdom of the way our company runs.” 
When I started to look outside, I found Fabrizio Freda, who is now our CEO. He was someone who was thinking along the lines of what I was thinking, but at the same time brought a very different perspective, a very different background. And I thought, “You know what, he’s going to add a spice and a way of looking at [Estée Lauder] that’s going to add more to what our company can do…. From the day I walked in as CEO, I said I will only be here as long as I can be as effective as or more effective than anyone else who can do this job. When I found Fabrizio … we got along great. [I said] “I think this is a partnership that can work. He can add a lot to our company, and our company can be a better company for what he can add. And he can help preserve what’s the best about what we do and then add some thoughts and disciplines to the way we do things to make it better.” 
After a year and half, I said, “You know what, this is perfect. Tag — you’re it! You’re now CEO.” How does that change my life? I’m spending more time on those things that I really like to do. I’m spending much more time on the strategy — the broad strategies of the company — and much more time in development of our emerging markets. I’m spending more time traveling, working on brand development, working on market development, working on strategic acquisitions. And I’m also working a great deal, unfortunately, on government relations. Why is that? There is an increasing regulatory environment around the world, predominately but not exclusively, in Asia and Europe, as well as in North America. I find I’m actually pretty good at that piece. 
That allows Fabrizio to keep doing what he’s really good at, and I can focus more on what I think I’m pretty good at. It seems to work very well for both of us and our company is performing better as a result. I still spend a great deal of time working not just with Fabrizio, but with a lot of members of his team. I’ve still got some executives who report directly to me in certain key roles because it’s both an expertise I have, and it’s the right allocation of responsibilities between the two of us.
What it effectively does, from a leadership perspective, is give us a strength in [the company’s] leadership of both a strong partnership as well as a very balanced approach as to who leads which efforts effectively. There are certain things that Fabrizio is expert at, and to which I say, “Go. Wonderful. Do this really well.” There are certain things [where I have more expertise] that he may be focusing in on, but we talk together about it and then he goes and does it. Or he may say, “Look, this is something I’m working on; I’d really love your assistance.” Either I say, “Go do it” and he does it, or he … tosses it in my lap and I go do it. We really are very comfortable. We both have enough of an ego, but there’s no ego in the sense of saying, “We want to get it accomplished.” We’re both very results oriented.
Knowledge@Wharton: In what countries or what regions is Estée Lauder looking to expand or create a new presence? How do you adapt to going into global markets, to different markets other than the U.S. and Europe?
Lauder: We’ve been a global company for 30, 40 plus years. We first expanded outside of the United States to the U.K. I think in 1960. Today, we’re doing 63% to 65% of our global business outside of North America. That’s growing much more rapidly than inside of North America for a number of reasons. Number one, it’s a less developed market, so the markets are growing faster. Number two, our share isn’t as strong as it is in North America, so therefore we have more share to gain. And number three, for the vast majority of the last 10 plus years, the dollar’s been very weak. The dollar’s weakness actually helps us as we translate our results back into dollars.
That combination of effects says we need to be continually investing more. We were in Europe very early on in the process, but most of our key competitors are European or Asian based. We don’t have as many American competitors in the prestige cosmetics base. They’re predominantly European, some Asian. But we’ve been early investors in a number of different markets in the world. 
This goes back to the question you asked about the advantages of a family controlled company. We’ve got a great deal of patience when it comes to investment and markets. We started investing in China 12 or 14 years ago. We made some very conscious decisions about six or seven years ago that we were going to ramp up our investments in China and we were going to change from a management perspective how we made those investments or how we treated those investments, to make sure that no short-term decision making got in the way of the long-term goal of having a leadership position in prestige cosmetics in China, as an example. We’re continuing to invest in India; it’s small now, but it’s growing. We’re investing in Russia and it’s growing very rapidly now and getting to significant size. We’re looking very seriously at Latin America. We have a presence in Latin America, but it’s small and it’s growing. Perhaps the next frontier is Africa, which is obviously growing very rapidly in population, and there seems to be a growing middle class. 
We’d like to see how the retail networks develop in those markets where there is some growing middle class. The key characteristic [for a new market for Estée Lauder] is a stronger emerging middle class with disposable income, which they want to spend on themselves. We’ve been investing in the Middle East for a number of years quite successfully and will continue to do so. 
There are lots of regions in the world that still offer us great opportunity, as well as our established markets where we look and say, “Well, how can we model those [new] markets against our more well-established markets and where can each of our brands go and develop their share to a level that we think matches the opportunity in the marketplace.
We continually find ways to invest in those opportunities where there are competitive advantages. And sometimes we pull back and say, “You know what? We’re not going to invest as much here because the investment’s not giving us the return we need.” That’s a very important element of what we do.
Knowledge@Wharton: How does the company adapt its marketing to attract a global audience? Is it one size fits all, or do you have to really specialize to fit the customer in different areas?
Lauder: The concept of global imagery for brands is very important. It’s a consistency of imagery, but not a slavish consistency of image to the point where all of a sudden, perhaps it looks the same around the world but isn’t as relevant in many places. How we customize the relevance is extremely important for the success of any of our marketing programs.
I’ll give you a great example. This was a number of years ago, but to me it’s a great example. We had a product where the key prop, for want of a better word, in the advertising shot was a birthday candle…. The notion was that you’re going to stop seeing the signs of aging, so you’re going to stop seeing the signs of what more and more birthday candles may mean. We liked the photograph. It was a beautiful photograph by a well-known photographer and it really looked great. We were showing the picture to our Asian brand managers for this one brand, and I noticed that when we showed it to them, they were very silent. Their silence was very loud. In many Asian cultures there’s a belief that one shouldn’t be confrontational. So instead of like their European counterparts saying, “I hate it, I don’t like it. And this is what you’re wrong about,” they were just quiet. They weren’t nodding saying, “Yes, I love it.” They weren’t clapping. They were just quiet.
To me it was a very loud silence. I said, “Guys, what’s up?” And finally one of the bolder ones said … it was a white birthday candle. They said, “Well, you know, in Asia, we only burn candles like this when somebody dies.” It was a revelation to us. [We said,] “What kind of candles do you have on a birthday cake or to celebrate somebody’s birthday?” They said, “It’s a red and white or a pink and white candle. Same style. But all white is when somebody dies; with a stripe in it is for a birthday.” Easy to fix, but that’s a cultural relevance piece. In other words, so there’s a consistency of the image, you just change the one thing that all of sudden says the wrong thing to the consumer. The most classic case is the Chevy Nova marketed in Latin America. In Spanish “nova” means “no go.” 
Knowledge@Wharton: One final question — can you share with us a favorite beauty tip of your grandmother’s?
Lauder: My grandmother was famous for so many expressions. She said, “Everybody’s beautiful.” And she said, “Every woman is beautiful; just some are lazier than others in how they work on their beauty.” 
One of my favorite expressions of hers is, “We have to get women to put their hands together. In this hand, she has her pocketbook and [her other hand] is her free hand. We need her to stick her free hand into her pocketbook, pull out her credit card and say, “I’ll take it.'” Because at the end of the day, the efforts we make to create the product we want is all about the customer saying, “I want it, I need it, I’ll use it and I’ll come back again.”

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
