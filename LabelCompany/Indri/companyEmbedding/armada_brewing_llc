THE ARMADA — Armada Brewing























































THE ARMADA







Cursed King IPA 6.5% ABV 66 IBUsOur leading American IPA is loaded with hoppy goodness and has a crisp malt finish. Time to step your hop game up and endulge. 







Fortune Raider Double IPA 8% 95 IBUsDo you like hops? Well you're sure to get your dose of some hoppy love here. Dry hopped twice to rock your fucking senses with citrus, stone fruit, and berries. 







White Storm Pale Ale 6.2% 50 IBU'sWe throw in a hefty amount of wheat malt to give you a soft mouthfeel and compliment the heavy doses of hops in here. Hazy by malt not yeast. 







Death of Corruption Black IPA 7.5% 90 IBUsThis killer right here is everything you ever wanted in a Black IPA. Light roasted character that doesn't interfere with the hop bitterness, delicate malt sweetness and loaded with a boatload of American hops in the whirlpool and dry hopped to whack you over the head with hoppy deliciousness.







Coffee King IPA 6.5% 66 IBUs Draft OnlyOur Cursed King made a deal with the devil to give you the best of both worlds. Hops and Coffee! If you were looking for a morning beer. You just found it. 







Savage Queen Double IPA 8% 85 IBUThe Queens beauty is expressed through a delicate malt profile and a load of tropical fruit, citrus, and berry. Brewed with Rakau, Mosaic and El Dorado hops.







Ghost of Atlantis Dry-Hopped Farmhouse Ale 6% 30 IBUA delicate and crisp malt backed with a tart and spicy finish from our Farmhouse yeast makes this brew super sessionable. We then dry-hop this beer with Huell Melon and Mandarina Bavaria hop to compliment the wonderful yeast.







Liberty Abandoned Russian Imperial Stout 9.5% 75 IBUsThis imperial stout is rich in malt flavor with chocolate, caramel, berry, and hints of burnt marshmallow leading the show. We use a load of English hops in the boil to give this puppy a firm bitterness to stand up to the large amounts of malt we use to get the alcohol level up.  Drink Fresh!Our beers are brewed in small batches, we use a lot of hops and we do not filter our beer. For your experience to be as amazing as we anticipated, we suggest consuming our beers within 1-2 months from packaging, though our beer is good to last up to 6 months. (see below for dates) Since our beers are not filtered some yeast is still in suspension of the beer when packaged. Though we do our best to minimize this with a thorough cold condition period, you may see that some sediment has formed on the bottom of the bottle. This is completely natural. We recommend storing Armada beers upright and in a fridge at least 1 hour prior to consumption. Enjoy!You say 750's are dead? We are here to resurrect them!ARMADA's mission is to bring together community around great beer. Just like a bottle of wine, 750's are the perfect size for sharing with friends. Break it into multiple glasses and toast to friends and good health. Quit it with the single serving sized beers and get down to sharing. This is your Captain speaking.Recycle please. Take care of OUR planet. Homebrewers reuse our bottles! We specifically chose a manufacturer of ARMADA labels that offered a product that stuck well, but was also easily removable. Crazy huh? No more scrapping, just peel, clean, sanitize and fill!Packaging DatesBatch #1 Cursed King IPA Bottled on 1/14/17Batch #2 Fortune Raider Double IPA Bottled on 2/26/17Batch #3 White Storm Pale Ale Bottled on 4/8/17Batch #4 Death of Corruption Black IPA 4/23/17Batch #5 Cursed King IPA TBD

Raising a New Flag



December  1, 2015



John Kraszewski












Today we raise a new flag for the Armada! Our journey has only just begun and we are proud to announce that we will be docking in my home state of Connecticut. Though a physical location has not been secured yet I am working to open in my hometown of West Haven. In Spring 2016 I will be moving to Connecticut with my family to get things rolling. In the mean time we will continue to raise capital and do events in Chicago. Chicago will always be a second home to Armada and we want to thank everyone who helped support us and get us this far. We will try to make sure we get product out to you as soon as we can. Why the move? Family. I want to share this journey with my family and do something great in my home state. We look forward to our move and you joining us on our journey.

West Haven man hopes mythical tale of Armada’s beers helps build business

John Kraszewski knows the value of a good story.



Telling his story of going from a one-time package store employee with a penchant for home brewing to launching his own craft beer helped the 30-year-old West Haven resident win the $5,000 first prize last month in a competition among start-up brewers. Kraszewski’s story about how he founded Armada Brewing and his grass-roots approach to building his business allowed him to beat out four other brewers at this year’s Startup Brewery Challenge, which was held in New York City on June 15.



Now, Kraszewski’s next goal is find a permanent home for Armada Brewing, which is currently being made at a slightly more established beer maker, Overshores Brewing Co. in East Haven.



“We want to get our own place because where you drink beer, the environment you drink it in, affects how that beer tastes,” Kraszewski said. “We want to find someplace that makes drinking our beer a memorable moment.”

For now, Krasewski has to be satisfied building his business one account at a time, one beer at a time.



Since launching its first beer at the beginning of the year, Armada Brewing curently services about 100 accounts, he said. Two-thirds of those accouints are in New Haven County, Kraszewski said.



One of the places selling Armada Beer is the New England Beverage Co. in Orange,



“We like to support local brews to begin with,” said Mario, and the store’s manager, who declined to give his last name. “He (Kraszewski) gave us a sample and I think he’s got a good product.”



It’s not easy getting into the beer business, even at a local level, said Gregg Glaser, editor of “Yankee Brew News” and publisher of “Modern Distillery Age”, two Fairfield County-based trade publications for the adult beverage industry.



“It takes chutzpah,” Glaser said. “There are lots of new beers being brewed and shelf space is tight. Distribution is tight, too.”



Some of the new beers turning up on store shelves are from “brewers that are super small,” Glaser said. To break out of the clutter in the beer marketplace, a fledgling brewer needs do some creative marketing, he said.



“A lot of them rely on clever names or clever images (on their bottles and cans),” Glaser said. “A lot of it is aimed at new drinkers who are young and find that attractive. Older drinkers might not find it as attractive.”



Armada Brewing is trying a little creative marketing, creating a mythical story line with the names of the brews it has launched thus far. 



The first India Pale Ale Armada produced is called the Cursed King. Subsequent brews Armada has launched add to the back story about the mythical king and his adventures. Since then, Kraszewski has added the Fortune Raider, the White Storm and Death to Corruption to Armada’s list of brews. He believes the back story sets Armada’s beers apart from rival brews. So do the 750 milliliter bottles that the beer comes in.



“We hope that with bottles that size, it will bring people together to share our beer and spark a conversation,” Kraszewski said.
