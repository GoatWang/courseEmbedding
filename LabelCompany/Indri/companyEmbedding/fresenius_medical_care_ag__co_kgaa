Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]

Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]

 Fresenius Medical Care Signs Agreements for Intravenous Iron Products
 juli 09, 2008



Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA, the world’s largest provider of dialysis products and services, today announced that it signed exclusive license agreements for the intravenous (IV) Iron products Venofer® (iron sucrose) and Ferinject® (ferric carboxymaltose) to treat iron deficiency anemia experienced by dialysis patients. Venofer® is the leading IV Iron product worldwide.Galenica Ltd., its subsidiary Vifor Pharma and Fresenius Medical Care are entering into a strategic joint venture for dialysis to market and distribute the two iron products Venofer® and Ferinject® in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The agreement concerns all commercialization activities for these IV Iron products in the field of dialysis and is expected to become effective not later than January 1st, 2009.Commercialization of these respective IV Iron products outside the field of dialysis will remain fully the responsibility of Vifor Pharma and its existing key partners. The total market for IV Iron in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America was greater than $120 million in 2007. After the first year of the agreement, Fresenius Medical Care expects yearly sales from both IV Iron products to be in excess of $50 million.In North America, a second Agreement provides for an exclusive U.S. manufacturing and distribution sublicense for Venofer® with Luitpold Pharmaceuticals Inc (Luitpold). In addition, it includes a similar sublicense for the next generation of iron products for the U.S. and Canada known as Injectafer® (ferric carboxymaltose) injection, which is expected to enhance the treatment of anemia in the dialysis patient population through the application of innovative drug administration techniques. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. The closing of the transaction is anticipated in 2008.Luitpold will continue to sell Venofer® for use in treating chronic kidney disease patients not yet on dialysis and in treating patients with acute renal failure in hospitals. Venofer® is currently the market leader in sales in the injectable iron market in the U.S. Currently, the total purchases of IV Iron in the U.S are approximately US$ 500 million. Venofer® has a U.S. market share of approximately 55%. Galenica Ltd., through its Vifor Pharma subsidiary, exclusively licenses the Venofer® and Injectafer® products to Luitpold and American Regent for the U.S. and Canada. As part of the 10-year Agreement for North America, Luitpold will continue to contract manufacture the products for Fresenius Medical Care. Luitpold will continue to pay royalties to Vifor Pharma, based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, which supplies the active pharmaceutical ingredient to Luitpold.Ben Lipps, Chief Executive Officer of Fresenius Medical Care, commented: “We are very pleased to have Galenica Ltd., Vifor Pharma, Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and American Regent, Inc., as our partners dedicated to improving the treatment of iron deficiency anemia experienced by dialysis patients. It is an excellent opportunity for us to access a proven and effective IV Iron product portfolio. With these agreements we will also deploy our "Pharmatech" strategy, aimed to introduce new drug delivery systems to improve quality and safety of dialysis treatments.”

Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]

The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]

Manufacturing[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care operates more than 40 production sites on all continents. Its largest plants in terms of production output are in the U.S. (Ogden, Utah, and Concord, California), Germany (Schweinfurt and St. Wendel), and Japan (Buzen). These plants are categorized as large and small with 25 large facilities and 15 small ones worldwide which cater to local demand for dialysis products.[3] Plants that fall under the concentrates division, manufacture finished products from raw materials, such as sodium chloride, dextrose, and magnesium, to name a few. Raw materials go through a complex mixing and packaging process.
Devices[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care manufactures a variety of durable medical devices used in the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Devices include Hemodialysis Machines, Peritoneal Dialysis Machines, Granuflo Concentrate Mixing Tanks and monitoring devices including the Crit-line device. The dialysis machines are manufactured in one of two plants to serve the globe. These plants are located in Schweinfurt, Germany and Concord, California. Crit-line devices are manufactured in Concord, California.
Distribution[edit]
Distribution is where the finished product, from Manufacturing, comes in on Semi-Trucks to be distributed to dialysis clinics, hospitals, and home dialysis patients. These products are then used in the dialysis process.
On 30 October 2006, the manufacturing facility (Fresenius Hemocare) in Redmond, Washington was shut down. Fresenius Hemocare has stopped going by the name Fresenius Hemocare and now goes by the name Fresenius-Kabi LLC. The closing of one of two entities inside of Hemocare allowed for the name change and takes Hemocare from the Medical Care group to the Kabi group.
In 2012, Fresenius acquired Liberty Dialysis Holdings, in a deal which entailed the sale of its outpatient dialysis clinics in 43 local markets within the U.S.
In 2013, Fresenius Medical Care NA acquired Shiel Medical Laboratory Inc, expanding services to New York City metro area.[citation needed]
Dialysis Units[edit]
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Services Limited runs 54 dialysis units across England[4] and more across Wales. In September 2014 new renal dialysis units run by Fresenius were opened at Withybush General Hospital and West Wales General Hospital, with a contract to run for at least 7 years.[5]
