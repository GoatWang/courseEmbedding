Tomorrow, built today.
Lightspeed Venture Partners is an early stage venture capital firm focused on accelerating disruptive innovations and trends in the Enterprise and Consumer sectors. Over the past two decades, the Lightspeed team has backed and helped build more than 300 companies globally, many of which have become market leaders. The Firm currently manages over $4 billion of committed capital and is currently investing out of Lightspeed XI, a $715 million fund and Lightspeed Select II, a $500 million fund. Our team invests in the U.S. and internationally, with investment professionals and advisors in Silicon Valley and Israel as well as in India with Lightspeed India Partners and China with Lightspeed China Partners.
The LIGHTSPEED Approach.

High value-added, lead investors
We tend to be the first institutional investors in companies and help them from the earliest stages of business development through successful exit and beyond.
Global reach
We have been investing internationally for over 10 years and currently have advisory teams on the ground in China, India, and Israel, to help us identify and invest in high-potential companies from around the world. With strong networks and team members across multiple geographies, we offer the same level of commitment and world-class expertise to our portfolio companies independent of location.
