Business Best Practices





Hackett-Certified™ Best Practices
Business best practices, as defined by The Hackett Group, are proven, repeatable, documented techniques that deliver measurable business performance management improvements. Executives look to business best practices benchmarking to help them speed their progress toward enterprise performance management improvement, and to guide them around pitfalls that might otherwise slow or even halt their initiatives.
What makes Hackett's business best practices unique is the reliability and depth of the documentation behind them. Business best practices that Hackett measures become "certified" when we can empirically document a correlation with the ability to achieve world-class performance. Our performance optimization standard of "world-class" describes organizations that achieved top-quartile performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Only The Hackett Group offers online access to a searchable best practices benchmarking repository backed by over 15 years of research through the Hackett Highway™ to our business Best Practices Intelligence Center™.

Hackett Best Practices™ recommended by The Hackett Group are based on our unparalleled database of more than 13,000 empirical studies from 3,500 participating organizations around the globe, including 93% of the Dow Jones Industrials, 87% of the Fortune 100, 87% of the DAX 30 and 58% of the FTSE 100.
Our studies address both qualitative performance – such as functional alignment with business, hr, procurement, IT and finance strategy, process design, process benchmarking, level of technology leverage, ability/readiness to partner with customers and suppliers, supply chain process and organization design – and traditional quantitative metrics, such as cost, cycle time, quality and productivity.
 









Best Practices Defined: 

Aligns with strategy 
Reduces costs 
Improves productivity 
Promotes timely execution 
Enables better decision making 
Leverages/exploits existing/emerging technologies 
Ensures acceptable levels of control and risk management 
Optimizes the skills and capabilities of the organization 
Promotes collaboration across the extended enterprise 

Regardless of industry, geographic location or organizational structure, executives can rely on Hackett best practices to put the weight of empirical evidence behind their business decisions.

Today no industry can exist without the assistance of the service industry. It has become an essential part of our everyday life. Service industry generally thrives on the needs of the people. The most important factor in the services is of the quality and the delivery time used by the service providers. As the economy of many nations in today�s date chugs on the growth of the service sector as it is contributing a substantial part to the GDP of a nation, hence it is a vital worldwide business prospect. As per service industry reports of a global survey, it has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
