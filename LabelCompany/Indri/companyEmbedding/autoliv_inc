History[edit]
Autoliv was founded in Vårgårda, Sweden in the form of Auto Service AB in 1953 by Lennart Lindblad. In 1956, the company became a pioneer in seat belt technology when it began production of two-point seat belts. The name of the company was changed to Autoliv AB in 1968. It was bought in 1974 by Granges Weda AB, inventors of the retractable seat belt. Granges Weda was acquired in turn in 1989 by Electrolux and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv AB. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company grew through acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Between 1994 and 1997 the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Autoliv AB and in 1997 it merged with the American firm Morton ASP Inc to form Autoliv Inc. Established on April 1, 2016, Autoliv and Nissin announced the creation of a joint new company Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems.[3] In 2017, Autoliv and Volvo Cars formed Zenuity, a jointly-owned company to develop the next generation of autonomous driving software.
Products[edit]
The company develop, manufacture and market passive safety systems (with a market share around 39%) such as airbags, seatbelts, steering wheels, passive safety electronics and active safety systems (estimated market share around 20-25%) including brake control systems, radar, night vision and camera vision systems. It also produce pedestrian protection systems. Passive safety systems are primarily meant to improve vehicle safety. Active safety systems objective is to intervene before an imminent accident in order to avoid it completely or reduce its impact. Active safety products in Autoliv's portfolio include automotive radars, night driving assist, camera-based vision systems, brake controls and other active safety systems. Autoliv's radar sensors were notably used by Uber in their self-driving taxi pilot project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Autonomous Driving[edit]
Since 2014, Autoliv's active safety products have increasingly sought to gain market share in the fast moving sector of automated driving. For this purpose, the company has lately escalated efforts to collaborate with and acquire companies with expertise in LiDAR, vision, GPS and mapping technologies. In 2015, the company announced the acquisition of M/A-COM's automotive equipment business which will expand Autoliv's capabilities in active safety and augment its GPS and Mapping division.[4] The same year, Autoliv commenced the "Drive Me" partnership venture with Volvo to offer semi-autonomous features in vehicles in Gothenburg, Sweden.[5] In September 2016, Autoliv and Volvo announced the creation of a joint new company for autonomous driving.[6] The company, named Zenuity, formally began operations in January 2017. It will develop systems for use in Volvo vehicles and for sale exclusively by Autoliv. [7]

Decelerating Vehicle Production Causes Autoliv Inc. to Miss Earnings Expectations
The speed bump the company hit last quarter had a greater-than-expected impact on the auto safety product maker's results.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 21, 2017 at 1:00PM
            
            





Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) didn't like what it spied on the horizon when it reported first-quarter results a few months ago. At that time, CEO Jan Carlson stated that the company saw "some uncertainties relating to light vehicle production growth, including high inventory levels and slower sales momentum, especially in North America and China." Those worrisome trends for slowing light vehicle production didn't go away during the second quarter, causing Autoliv's results to come in below expectations. Furthermore, the company anticipates that those headwinds will persist during the third quarter, which led it to reduce its full-year organic sales growth guidance.

What happened with Autoliv this quarter?
Light-vehicle production growth slowed during the quarter.

Autoliv anticipated that organic sales would grow by around 2% this quarter. However, after adjusting for the impact of currencies, organic sales only increased 0.2% due to lower-than-expected light-vehicle sales in China and North America. Overall, light-vehicle production was flat during the quarter as a 1.2% decline in China and a 0.4% decrease the Americas overwhelmed a double-digit jump from Japan.
Hardest hit by the flattening out of production was the company's electronics segment, where reported revenue fell 3.2% (and was still down 1.2% after adjusting for the negative impact of currencies). Sales of restraint control and sensing products dropped 5.8%, while revenue from brake systems was down 8.3%. The lone bright spot was active safety sales, which rose 6% on an organic basis thanks to strong sales of radar and camera systems.
Autoliv's passive safety segment was also under pressure during the quarter. Sales slipped 0.6%, though they were up 0.8% after adjusting for the impact of currencies thanks to a 1.4% organic rise in airbag sales, primarily on strength in China and Japan.
The weaker organic sales growth caused margins to come in a bit below expectations. The company anticipated that its adjusted operating margin would be around 8.5%, but it came in at 8.4%.
Several items caused earnings per share to fall despite a slight rise in operating income, including tax items, currencies, and the impact of equity accounting on investments.
On a more positive note, operating cash flow surged 74.9% to $179.4 million due to changes in working capital, which is the money it needs to run its day-to-day operations.






What management had to say
Autoliv CEO Jan Carlson commented on what drove its results during the second quarter:

I am pleased that we continue to execute well in Passive Safety and that proactive adjustments to a weaker market in China and North America helped the segment generate another quarter of double digit operating margin, despite continued elevated investments for growth. We managed another quarter with good operating efficiency, and our strong gross margin performance enabled us to meet our adjusted operating margin expectation although the organic sales growth was slightly below our expectation due to lower light vehicle production in China and North America. Order intake continued on a high level in Passive Safety in the quarter.

As Carlson points out, the company operated well in a less-than-ideal environment. Automakers had hoped that their strong sales momentum from last year would continue in 2017, but that hasn't been the case. GM (NYSE:GM), for example, recently reduced its forecast for 2017 U.S. vehicle sales. The U.S. automaker now foresees sales in the low 17 million range, down from an initial expectation that sales would match last year's peak of 17.55 million. One of the culprits is a glut of cars on the market, which is causing GM to slow production. 
Looking forward
Autoliv expects higher light-vehicle inventory in the U.S. and elsewhere as well as slow sales momentum and uncertainty in China and North America to continue to impact its sales in the near term. Because of that, the company only expects organic sales growth in the range of 0% to 2% during the third quarter with an operating margin in the 7.5% to 8% range.
Given the weakness in the second quarter and the outlook for the third, Autoliv is reducing its full-year expectations. The company now sees organic sales growth of around 2% for the full year, down from its initial expectation of a 4% increase. That said, the company does still expect its operating margin to be around 8.5% for the year.

Decelerating Vehicle Production Causes Autoliv Inc. to Miss Earnings Expectations @themotleyfool #stocks $GM, $ALV




































Autoliv Inc. - An Undervalued Lifesaver - Autoliv Inc. (NYSE:ALV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Autoliv Inc. - An Undervalued LifesaverMay.10.17 | About: Autoliv Inc. (ALV) Societe Financiers Growth at reasonable price, long/short equity, long-term horizon, valueSummaryAutoliv’s stock does not seem able to recover after the Brexit.
        The company’s market and financial positions stay strong.
        The markets for the company’s key products are expected to grow faster than the economies of the respective geographical regions.
        Our DCF analysis shows that there is a considerable upside opportunity at current market levels.
        Autoliv Inc. (ALV) is a world leader in automotive safety. The company's share price has fallen from the level that we consider to be fair (our target range is $113 - $125 per share) since June 2016. The decline was mainly caused by the Brexit panic. The Brexit referendum was held on Thursday, June 23, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. The result is well-known. The next day Autoliv's shares were under pressure (see the graph below). The company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ALV) and its Swedish Depository Receipts are listed on the OMX Nordic Exchange in Stockholm (ALIV sdb). As a result, the European asset sale was the driver for the share's price decline. Autoliv Inc. has Swedish roots but at the present time the company is a multinational and highly diversified US-incorporated firm with little business exposure in Europe. More imporantly, the company is in a good financial shape and operates in the favorable business climate. As a result, our valuation model shows a significant upside potential. 

 (Source: Investopedia.com) Dependence on Europe According to company's annual report: " The Company's sales are split over several hundred contracts covering approximately 1,300 vehicle models which generally moderates the effect of changes in vehicle demand of individual countries and regions or stops in production, due to, for instance, natural disasters. The risk in fluctuating sales has also been mitigated by Autoliv's rapid expansion in Asia and other growth markets, which has reduced the Company's former high dependence on Europe from more than 50% of sales to a diversified mix with Europe, the Americas and Asia each accounting for roughly one third of 2016 sales."
 

 (Source: Autoliv's annual report) The company's customer base has become more balanced and diversified as a result of Autoliv's significant expansion in Asia. In FY2016, the Asian sales reached a of 36% of total sales: in comparison, sales in the Americas and Europe accounted to 34% and 30% of total revenue, respectively. In 2016, Autoliv strengthened its Asian liaisons and formed the Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems (ANBS) JV with Nissin Kogyo. Nissin Kogyo is a "keiretsu" of Honda, which has a 35% ownership stake in the company. Some might say that the June 2016 events affected many companies' shares, not only European ones. But in fact, if we compare the price movement of Autoliv's shares with competitors like Visteon Corp. ( VC), Delphi Automotive PLC ( DLPH), and Denso Corp. (6902), we see a recovery in the rivals' share prices: 

 (Source: Morningstar.com) There does not seem to be reasons why Autoliv's shares should not follow the trends of the company's peers. Business Climate: The #1 Driver Autoliv Inc. is a so-called Tier 1 supplier of the autoparts for light vehicles. This means company sells its products directly to the original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Consequently, the company's sales are driven by light vehicle production. Market experts see a potential for the continuous growth for the next six years: 


 (Source: PwC Autofacts, March 9, 2017) The company's management describes the target market as follows: "Our addressable market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 8% until 2019, to about $34 billion, based on the current macro-economic outlook and our internal market intelligence and estimates…" (Source: Annual report) We will show the effect of this expected growth in the assumptions to our valuation model. Business Climate: Government Regulation Automotive safety systems have a great impact on society, thus, government regulations can create additional demand for such products. Below is the Regulatory Timeline for Safety Technology Recommendations/Mandates, U.S. & EU: 

 "Every year, almost 33,000 people are killed in motor vehicle accidents in the United States. Additionally, these crashes cause 3.9 million non-fatal injuries and damage 24 million vehicles… ADAS alone has the potential to save society roughly $16,000 per car, and fully autonomous cars could generate societal savings of as much as $53,000 per car sold when they have fully penetrated the market." (Source: BCG & MEMA research report) No wonder that NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) continues to promote the adoption of the safety features. The BCG & MEMA research report gives us the following additional facts: "Since the 2012 model year, electronic stability control systems have been required for all new light vehicles, and by model year 2018 all light vehicles will be required to install a rearview camera system. In addition, NHTSA is in the process of updating the NCAP to include AEB systems featuring two system types - crash imminent braking and dynamic brake support. The agency is studying other ADAS features such as lane keeping assist but has not yet mandated these technologies."
 There is more evidence for the beneficial regulation activity: "In 2007, the U.S. adopted new regulations for side-impact protection which now have been fully phased-in. China introduced a vehicle rating program in 2006, and Latin America introduced a similar program in 2010. The United States upgraded its vehicle rating program in 2010 and Europe completed an upgrade of its EuroNCAP rating system in 2012 and has initiated a further upgrade, which will be fully implemented by 2017. There are also other plans for improved automotive safety, both in these countries and many other countries that could affect the Company's market... Thanks to more stringent crash ratings, by institutes such as EuroNCAP, and the trends towards more automated vehicles, we see a strong demand of more active safety sensors and software. We also see vehicle manufacturers installing more airbags and more advanced seatbelt systems in their vehicles, generally when new models are introduced. The safety standards of vehicles are increasing in China, India and other growth markets such as Brazil, partially due to new regulations and crash test rating programs. For example the Indian government has decided on a new traffic legalization that mandate more rigid crash test standards of light vehicles. This should eventually lead to higher installation rate of airbags and more advanced seatbelts." (Source: Autoliv's Annual Report) Autoliv can definitely benefit from the broad implementation of such regulations. They can help improve the second main driver of the company's sales - content per vehicle (NYSE:CPV), i.e. value of the safety products in a vehicle. It a is very important factor of success because growth of CPV enables the automotive safety market to grow faster than the light vehicles' production. Business Climate: Current Products and Future Trends 


 (Source: BCG & MEMA research report) Regardless of future changes, passive safety components will still be required to protect occupants in the event of a car crash. It is a vital product line for Autoliv because the passive safety segment is the biggest revenue source: 

 (Source: Company's Financials, Author's DCF Model) Nowadays, the passive safety components market is the primary provider of life-saving safety products in the world. These products play a big role in emerging markets, including fast-growing China and India ( in contrast to the active safety products). Autoliv is a global market leader both in airbags and seatbelts with the shares in these markets of around 40% and 39%, respectively. The market for the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is one of the fastest growing areas of vehicle equipment in the world and is expected to grow at an annual rate of 20-30% between 2016 and 2019 (Source: Autoliv's annual report). By continuously developing and introducing new technologies with higher value-added features, Autoliv is keeping its leading positions in automotive electronics (it has a market share of around 25%) and active safety products, such as radars, night vision systems, front-view mono and stereo vision cameras, and ADAS ECU's (it has a market share of around 15-20%) (Source: Autoliv's annual report). For the purposes of further expansion in the ADAS segment and development of brand new autonomous driving (AD) systems, Autoliv Inc. and Volvo Cars signed an agreement to form a new jointly-owned company. The new company will develop ADAS and AD systems for the use in Volvo Cars and for sale exclusively by Autoliv to all OEMs. The revenues will be shared by both companies. Operations are expected to start in the first half of 2017 (Source: Autoliv's annual report).
 We can conclude that Autoliv is not only a global market leader in the automotive safety in the present time but also has a solid foundation for long-term development. Financial Standing According to the latest S&P report (as of October 28, 2016), Autoliv Inc. has a corporate credit rating of A-/Stable/A-2, which fits the minimal financial risk profile. Among the positive factors are the company's prudent financial management and a leverage target of about 1.0x net debt-to-EBITDA in the long-term. At the end of FY2016, the ratio was equal to 0.4x. DCF Model To substantiate our analysis, we have decided to include a DCF model to present our view of the company's valuation. We have used the following growth assumptions: Revenue CAGR is set at the historical level of ~ 5% (FY 2017 - FY2021) in our "Base Case Scenario" and at 8% (management's target level) in the "Optimistic Scenario"; EBIT forecast for the period FY2017 - FY2021 is based on the average historical operating profitability of 8.3% (% of sales method) in the "Base Case Scenario" and at 8.5% of sales (management's target level) in the "Optimistic Scenario"; D&A expenses are tied to revenue growth. We apply the recent percentage of sales to forecasts; CapEx stand at a level of 5.5% of revenue, according to the management's plans. It is higher than the average historical level of 4.7%; The rest of the forecast period's figures are calculated according to the historical numbers. Our DCF model shows that, after the implementation of the above-described assumptions, the target range per share is: - $113 - $125 in the "Base Case Scenario"; - $133 - $145 in the "Optimistic Scenario". The fair value per share is higher than the current market price of the stock in both cases (around $103 per share as of the time of writing). This means that there is a great upside potential for the stock. Below is the visualization of the "Base Case Scenario" and the "Optimistic Scenario": 


 (Source: Author's DCF Model) "Optimistic Scenario": 

 (Source: Author's DCF Model) Conclusion We do not see fundamental reasons for the obvious undervaluation of Autoliv Inc.'s shares relative to the company's peers. According to our analysis, the strong market position in key product lines, the minimal financial risk, and the clear path for future development make Autoliv one of the best investment opportunities in the automotive market. Our valuation model leads to the target price range of $113 - $125 per share, which is 10% - 20% higher than the market price of the stock. Hence, we recommend buying the stock aiming at the mentioned price range. Societe Financiers is an investment research team focused on long-term, long- and short-only ideas.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
Autoliv was founded in Vårgårda, Sweden in the form of Auto Service AB in 1953 by Lennart Lindblad. In 1956, the company became a pioneer in seat belt technology when it began production of two-point seat belts. The name of the company was changed to Autoliv AB in 1968. It was bought in 1974 by Granges Weda AB, inventors of the retractable seat belt. Granges Weda was acquired in turn in 1989 by Electrolux and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv AB. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company grew through acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Between 1994 and 1997 the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Autoliv AB and in 1997 it merged with the American firm Morton ASP Inc to form Autoliv Inc. Established on April 1, 2016, Autoliv and Nissin announced the creation of a joint new company Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems.[3] In 2017, Autoliv and Volvo Cars formed Zenuity, a jointly-owned company to develop the next generation of autonomous driving software.
Products[edit]
The company develop, manufacture and market passive safety systems (with a market share around 39%) such as airbags, seatbelts, steering wheels, passive safety electronics and active safety systems (estimated market share around 20-25%) including brake control systems, radar, night vision and camera vision systems. It also produce pedestrian protection systems. Passive safety systems are primarily meant to improve vehicle safety. Active safety systems objective is to intervene before an imminent accident in order to avoid it completely or reduce its impact. Active safety products in Autoliv's portfolio include automotive radars, night driving assist, camera-based vision systems, brake controls and other active safety systems. Autoliv's radar sensors were notably used by Uber in their self-driving taxi pilot project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Autonomous Driving[edit]
Since 2014, Autoliv's active safety products have increasingly sought to gain market share in the fast moving sector of automated driving. For this purpose, the company has lately escalated efforts to collaborate with and acquire companies with expertise in LiDAR, vision, GPS and mapping technologies. In 2015, the company announced the acquisition of M/A-COM's automotive equipment business which will expand Autoliv's capabilities in active safety and augment its GPS and Mapping division.[4] The same year, Autoliv commenced the "Drive Me" partnership venture with Volvo to offer semi-autonomous features in vehicles in Gothenburg, Sweden.[5] In September 2016, Autoliv and Volvo announced the creation of a joint new company for autonomous driving.[6] The company, named Zenuity, formally began operations in January 2017. It will develop systems for use in Volvo vehicles and for sale exclusively by Autoliv. [7]

History[edit]
Autoliv was founded in Vårgårda, Sweden in the form of Auto Service AB in 1953 by Lennart Lindblad. In 1956, the company became a pioneer in seat belt technology when it began production of two-point seat belts. The name of the company was changed to Autoliv AB in 1968. It was bought in 1974 by Granges Weda AB, inventors of the retractable seat belt. Granges Weda was acquired in turn in 1989 by Electrolux and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv AB. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company grew through acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Between 1994 and 1997 the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Autoliv AB and in 1997 it merged with the American firm Morton ASP Inc to form Autoliv Inc. Established on April 1, 2016, Autoliv and Nissin announced the creation of a joint new company Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems.[3] In 2017, Autoliv and Volvo Cars formed Zenuity, a jointly-owned company to develop the next generation of autonomous driving software.
Products[edit]
The company develop, manufacture and market passive safety systems (with a market share around 39%) such as airbags, seatbelts, steering wheels, passive safety electronics and active safety systems (estimated market share around 20-25%) including brake control systems, radar, night vision and camera vision systems. It also produce pedestrian protection systems. Passive safety systems are primarily meant to improve vehicle safety. Active safety systems objective is to intervene before an imminent accident in order to avoid it completely or reduce its impact. Active safety products in Autoliv's portfolio include automotive radars, night driving assist, camera-based vision systems, brake controls and other active safety systems. Autoliv's radar sensors were notably used by Uber in their self-driving taxi pilot project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Autonomous Driving[edit]
Since 2014, Autoliv's active safety products have increasingly sought to gain market share in the fast moving sector of automated driving. For this purpose, the company has lately escalated efforts to collaborate with and acquire companies with expertise in LiDAR, vision, GPS and mapping technologies. In 2015, the company announced the acquisition of M/A-COM's automotive equipment business which will expand Autoliv's capabilities in active safety and augment its GPS and Mapping division.[4] The same year, Autoliv commenced the "Drive Me" partnership venture with Volvo to offer semi-autonomous features in vehicles in Gothenburg, Sweden.[5] In September 2016, Autoliv and Volvo announced the creation of a joint new company for autonomous driving.[6] The company, named Zenuity, formally began operations in January 2017. It will develop systems for use in Volvo vehicles and for sale exclusively by Autoliv. [7]

History[edit]
Autoliv was founded in Vårgårda, Sweden in the form of Auto Service AB in 1953 by Lennart Lindblad. In 1956, the company became a pioneer in seat belt technology when it began production of two-point seat belts. The name of the company was changed to Autoliv AB in 1968. It was bought in 1974 by Granges Weda AB, inventors of the retractable seat belt. Granges Weda was acquired in turn in 1989 by Electrolux and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv AB. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company grew through acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Between 1994 and 1997 the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Autoliv AB and in 1997 it merged with the American firm Morton ASP Inc to form Autoliv Inc. Established on April 1, 2016, Autoliv and Nissin announced the creation of a joint new company Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems.[3] In 2017, Autoliv and Volvo Cars formed Zenuity, a jointly-owned company to develop the next generation of autonomous driving software.
Products[edit]
The company develop, manufacture and market passive safety systems (with a market share around 39%) such as airbags, seatbelts, steering wheels, passive safety electronics and active safety systems (estimated market share around 20-25%) including brake control systems, radar, night vision and camera vision systems. It also produce pedestrian protection systems. Passive safety systems are primarily meant to improve vehicle safety. Active safety systems objective is to intervene before an imminent accident in order to avoid it completely or reduce its impact. Active safety products in Autoliv's portfolio include automotive radars, night driving assist, camera-based vision systems, brake controls and other active safety systems. Autoliv's radar sensors were notably used by Uber in their self-driving taxi pilot project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Autonomous Driving[edit]
Since 2014, Autoliv's active safety products have increasingly sought to gain market share in the fast moving sector of automated driving. For this purpose, the company has lately escalated efforts to collaborate with and acquire companies with expertise in LiDAR, vision, GPS and mapping technologies. In 2015, the company announced the acquisition of M/A-COM's automotive equipment business which will expand Autoliv's capabilities in active safety and augment its GPS and Mapping division.[4] The same year, Autoliv commenced the "Drive Me" partnership venture with Volvo to offer semi-autonomous features in vehicles in Gothenburg, Sweden.[5] In September 2016, Autoliv and Volvo announced the creation of a joint new company for autonomous driving.[6] The company, named Zenuity, formally began operations in January 2017. It will develop systems for use in Volvo vehicles and for sale exclusively by Autoliv. [7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
