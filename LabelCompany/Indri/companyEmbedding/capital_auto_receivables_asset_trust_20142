                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF
RECEIVABLES

SECTION 3.01 Duties of the
Servicer.

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed
and authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Receivables and
in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and process
collections on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of
Servicer with respect to the Receivables set forth herein and in
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements.

(b) The Servicer’s duties
shall include collection and posting of all payments, responding to
inquiries of Obligors, investigating delinquencies, sending billing
statements to Obligors, policing the collateral, including
remarketing repossessed and returned Financed Vehicles, accounting
for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Receivables with respect to distributions, generating
federal income tax information and performing the other duties
specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.02 , the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures and shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection
with such managing, servicing, administration and collection that
it may deem necessary or desirable.

(c) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered
by the Owner of the Receivables, pursuant to this
Section 3.01 , to execute and deliver, on behalf of all
Interested Parties, or any of them, any and all instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Receivables and the Financed Vehicles (including proceeds). The
Servicer is hereby authorized to (i) commence, in its own name
or in the name of the Owner of such Receivable a legal proceeding,
whether through judicial process or (with respect to repossession
of a Financed Vehicle) non-judicial process, (ii) participate
in a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding to enforce a
Liquidating Receivable or Receivable as contemplated by
Section 3.03 , (iii) enforce all obligations of
the Seller, the Servicer, CARI or the Issuing Entity under this
Agreement and under the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
or (iv) commence or participate in a legal proceeding
(including a bankruptcy case) relating to or involving a Receivable
or a Liquidating Receivable. If the Servicer commences or
participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the
Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.01 to obtain
possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and
without further action on the part of the Owner or the Servicer,
the Owner of such Receivable shall thereupon automatically assign
in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Interested
Parties immediately prior to such legal or liquidation proceeding
for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding
as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the
Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a
secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect
to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the
Servicer’s request from time to time, the Owner of a
Receivable assigned under this Section 3.01 shall
provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for
the benefit of the Interested Parties as may be reasonably
necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in
the following sentence.
 
6



(d) The Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Owner of a Receivable to execute
and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner of
Receivables shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out
its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement and
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements. Except to the extent
required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights
granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the
retention by the Owner of a Receivable of equivalent authority and
rights.

SECTION 3.02 Collection of
Receivable Payments . The Servicer shall make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become
due, and shall follow such collection practices, policies and
procedures as it follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle
related receivables that it services for itself or others in
connection therewith. Except as provided in
Section 3.06(a)(iii) , the Servicer is hereby
authorized to grant extensions, rebates or adjustments on a
Receivable without the prior consent of the Owner of such
Receivable. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive
any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other fees that
may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing such
Receivable.

SECTION 3.03 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and other actions by the Servicer in order to
realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby authorized
to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary practices,
policies and procedures and the terms of the Basic Documents, in
servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize the net
collection of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion that such repair and/or repossession
shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related
Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses.
The Servicer shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with
respect to each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the
Receivable becomes a Liquidating Receivable (or as may otherwise be
provided in the Further Transfer and Servicing
Agreements).

policies and procedures, track such physical damage insurance with
respect to each Receivable.

SECTION 3.05 Maintenance of
Security Interests in Vehicles . The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary practices, policies and procedures
and at its own expense, take such steps as are necessary to
maintain perfection of the security interest created by each
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Owner of each
Receivable hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such
security interest on behalf of such Owner, as necessary because of
the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other
reason.

      Fitch to Rate Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2014-3; Issues Presale
    





August 22, 2014 11:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3 (US ABS)
    

http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=757527


      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      (CARAT) 2014-3:
    

      --$255,000,000 class A-1 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,400,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,200,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36,190,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,170,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,150,000 class E notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2014-3 pool is representative of 
      nonprime collateral, with a 632 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 7.87% WA APR and 100% WA LTV. 63% of the pool consists of 
      new vehicle contracts, while extended-term contracts total 73%, all 
      relatively consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables mitigate this risk to an extent. Fitch accounts 
      for this risk in its derivation of the 5.50% base case loss proxy for 
      2014-3.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with all prior transactions. The reserve is 0.50% 
      non-declining, and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 3.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance) growing to a target of 4.75% post revolving 
      period. Excess spread totals 4.61% per annum, down from 2014-2 (NR).
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's non-prime U.S. auto loan portfolio 
      exhibited improved performance in 2009-2013 relative to the weak 
      2006-2008 period, supported by gradual improvement in the U.S. economy 
      and healthy used vehicle values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B Stable Rating 
      Outlook. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      non-prime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each 
      class of CARAT 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with some classes 
      showing potential downgrades of up to two rating categories under 
      Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of notes 
      could experience downgrades of more than three rating categories under 
      Fitch's severe (2.0x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

Person in connection with the Receivables, any Dealer Agreements,
any insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument
relating to any of them.

(e) Within two (2) Business
Days after the Initial Closing Date, with respect to the Initial
Receivables, and within two (2) Business Days after each
related Subsequent Closing Date, with respect to the Additional
Receivables, the Servicer shall cause to be deposited into the
Collection Account the collections on the Receivables described in

Issuing Entity shall retain in the Accumulation Account any funds
deposited therein on a Distribution Date which are not used
pursuant to Section 2.01(b) above to purchase

Receivable Files . In connection with the sale, transfer and
assignment of the Receivables to the Issuing Entity pursuant to
this Agreement and the Second Step Receivables Assignments, the
Custodian, under the Custodian Agreement, agrees to act as

provisions of the Custodian Agreement and designates Ally Financial
as the custodian with respect to the Receivables Files.

consideration conveyed by the Depositor pursuant to

Section 2.01(a)(v) , the Depositor assigns to the
Issuing Entity all of its right, title and interest in, to and
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Such assigned right,
title and interest includes the benefit of representations and
warranties of the Seller made to the Depositor pursuant to
Section 4.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Issuing Entity
that the Depositor has taken no action which would cause such
representations and warranties of the Seller to be false in any
material respect as of the Initial Closing Date with respect to the
Initial Receivables, and as of the related Subsequent Closing Date,
with respect to the Additional Receivables. The Depositor further
acknowledges that the Issuing Entity and its permitted assignees
rely on the representations and warranties of the Depositor under
this Agreement and of the Seller under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement in accepting the Receivables in trust and executing and
delivering the Notes and the Certificates. The foregoing
representation and warranty speaks as of the Initial Closing Date
with respect to the Initial Receivables, and as of the related
Subsequent Closing Date, with respect to the Additional
Receivables, but shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of
the Receivables to the Issuing Entity and the pledge thereof to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

Section 2.05 Repurchase of
Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty . Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 4.01 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement or in Section 2.04 or
Section 3.01 of this Agreement that materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders or the
Certificateholders in any Receivable, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice thereof to the others. As
of the last day of the second Monthly Period following its
discovery or its receipt of notice of such breach (or, at the
Depositor’s election, the last day of the first Monthly
Period following such discovery or receipt of notice), unless such
breach shall have been cured in all material respects, in the event
of a breach of the representations and warranties made by the
Depositor in Section 2.04 or Section 3.01 ,
the Depositor shall repurchase, or in the event of a breach of a
representation and warranty under Section 4.01 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Depositor and the Servicer
shall use reasonable efforts to enforce the obligation of the
Seller under Section 5.04 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement to repurchase such Receivable from the Issuing Entity on
the related Distribution Date. The repurchase price to be paid by
the breaching party (the “ Warranty Purchaser ”)
shall be an amount equal to the Warranty Payment calculated as of
the last day of the related Monthly Period. It is understood and
agreed that the obligation of the Warranty Purchaser to repurchase
any Receivable as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing,
and the obligation of the Depositor and the Servicer to enforce the
Seller’s obligation to repurchase such Receivables pursuant
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall, if such obligations
are fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against the Depositor,
the Servicer or the Seller for such breach available to the Issuing
Entity, the Financial Parties, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee. The Servicer also acknowledges its obligations to
repurchase Administrative Receivables from the Issuing Entity
pursuant to Section 3.07 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

Section 2.06 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default
 
5


under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and the taking of other actions by the Servicer in
order to realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary
practices, policies and procedures and the terms of this Agreement,
in servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize the net
collections of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion and in accordance with such servicing
procedures that such repair or repossession shall increase the
proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by an amount
greater than the amount of such expenses. The Servicer shall be
entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to each
Liquidating Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes a
Liquidating Receivable.

Section 2.07 Conditions to Sales
of Additional Receivables . The Depositor shall sell, transfer,
assign and otherwise convey to the Issuing Entity on each

“ Collection Account ”), bearing an additional
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are
held for the benefit of the Financial Parties.

(ii) The Servicer, for the benefit
of the Noteholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Indenture Trustee an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital
Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2014-3 Note Distribution Account (the

(i) Each of the Designated Accounts
shall be initially established with the Indenture Trustee. At any
time after the Initial Closing Date, the Servicer, upon thirty
(30) days written notice to the Indenture Trustee or other
Account Holder, shall have the right to instruct an Account Holder
to transfer any or all of the Designated Accounts to another
Eligible Institution designated by the Servicer in such notice. No
Designated Account shall be maintained with an Account Holder if
the short-term debt obligations of such Account Holder cease to
have the Required Deposit Rating (except that any Designated
Account may be maintained with an Account Holder even if the
short-term debt obligations of such Account Holder do not have the
Required Deposit Rating, if such Account Holder maintains such
Designated Account in its corporate trust department). Should the
short-term unsecured debt obligations of an Account Holder no
longer have the Required Deposit Rating, then the Servicer shall,
within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period, not to
exceed thirty (30) calendar days, as to which each Rating
Agency shall consent), with the Indenture Trustee’s
assistance as necessary, cause each affected Designated Account
(A) to be moved to an Account Holder that is an Eligible
Institution or (B) with respect to the Designated Accounts
only, to be moved to the corporate trust department of the Account
Holder. All amounts held in Designated Accounts (including amounts,
if any, which the Servicer is required to remit daily to the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.02 ) shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and regulations, be
invested, at the written direction of the Servicer, by such Account
Holder in Eligible Investments. Such written direction shall
constitute certification by the Servicer that any such investment
is authorized by this Section 5.01 . Funds deposited in
the Reserve Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments which
mature (i) prior to the next Distribution Date or (ii) at
such later date as shall be otherwise permitted by the Rating
Agencies. Investments in Eligible Investments shall be made in the
name of the Indenture Trustee or its nominee, and such investments
shall not be sold or disposed of prior to their maturity;
provided , however , that Notes held in the Reserve
Account may be sold or disposed of prior to their maturity so long
as (x) the Servicer directs the Indenture Trustee to make such
sale or disposition, (y) the Indenture Trustee gives
reasonable prior notice of such disposition to the Administrator
and (z) such Notes are sold at a price equal to or greater
than the unpaid principal balance thereof if, following such sale,
the amount on deposit in the Reserve Account would be less than the
Specified Reserve Account Balance. Investment Earnings on funds
deposited in the Designated Accounts shall be payable to the
Servicer. Each Account Holder holding a Designated Account as
provided in this Section 5.01(b)(i) , shall be a
“ Securities Intermediary .” If a Securities
Intermediary shall be a Person other than the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer shall obtain the express agreement of such Person to
the obligations of the Securities Intermediary set forth in this
Section 5.01 and an Opinion of Counsel that such Person
can perform such obligations.

(ii) With respect to the Designated
Account Property, the Account Holder agrees, by its acceptance
hereof, that:

that is held in deposit accounts shall be held solely in Eligible
Deposit Accounts. The Designated Accounts are accounts to which
Financial Assets will be credited.
 
22



(B) All securities or other property
underlying any Financial Assets credited to the Designated Accounts
shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary,
indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank or credited to
another securities account maintained in the name of the Securities
Intermediary and in no case will any Financial Asset credited to
any of the Designated Accounts be registered in the name of the
Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor, payable to the order
of the Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor or specially
indorsed to the Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor
except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to
the Securities Intermediary or in blank.

(C) All property delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to this Agreement will be credited
upon receipt of such property to the appropriate Designated
Account.

(D) Each item of property (whether
investments, investment property, Financial Assets, securities,
instruments or cash) credited to a Designated Account shall be
treated as a “financial asset” within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York UCC.

(E) If at any time the Securities
Intermediary shall receive any order from the Indenture Trustee
directing transfer or redemption of any Financial Asset relating to
the Designated Accounts, the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such order without further consent by the Issuing Entity, the
Servicer, the Depositor or any other Person.

(F) The Designated Accounts shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, regardless of any
provision in any other agreement. For purposes of the UCC, New York
shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary’s
jurisdiction and the Designated Accounts (as well as the Security
Entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York.

(G) The Securities Intermediary has
not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will
not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to the
Designated Accounts and/or any Financial Assets or other property
credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with
entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the
New York UCC) of such other Person and the Securities Intermediary
has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement
will not enter into, any agreement with the Issuing Entity, the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Account Holder or the Indenture
Trustee purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set
forth in Section 5.01(b)(ii)(E) hereof.

(H) Except for the claims and
interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Designated Accounts, the
Securities Intermediary has no actual knowledge of claims to, or
interests in, the Designated Accounts or in any Financial Asset
credited thereto. If any other Person asserts any Lien, encumbrance
or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment,
warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) against the
Designated Accounts or in any Financial Asset carried therein, the
Securities Intermediary will promptly notify the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer and the Issuing Entity thereof.
 
23



(I) The Securities Intermediary will
promptly send copies of all statements, confirmations and other
correspondence concerning the Designated Accounts and/or any
Designated Account Property simultaneously to each of the Servicer
and the Indenture Trustee, at the addresses set forth in
Appendix B to this Agreement.

(J) The Account Holder shall
maintain each item of Designated Account Property in the particular
Designated Account to which such item originated and shall not
commingle items from different Designated Accounts.

(iii) The Servicer shall have the
power, revocable by the Indenture Trustee (or by the Owner Trustee
with the consent of the Indenture Trustee) to instruct the
Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the
Designated Accounts for the purpose of permitting the Servicer or
the Owner Trustee to carry out its respective duties hereunder or
permitting the Indenture Trustee to carry out its duties under the
Indenture.

(iv) The Indenture Trustee shall
possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Designated Accounts and in all
proceeds thereof (except Investment Earnings). Except as otherwise
provided herein or in the Indenture, the Designated Accounts shall
be under the exclusive dominion and control of the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Indenture
Trustee shall have sole signature power and authority with respect
thereto.

(v) The Servicer shall not direct
the Account Holder to make any investment of any funds or to sell
any investment held in any of the Designated Accounts unless the
security interest granted and perfected in such account shall
continue to be perfected in such investment or the proceeds of such
sale, in either case without any further action by any Person, and,
in connection with any direction to the Account Holder to make any
such investment or sale, if requested by the Indenture Trustee, the
Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel, acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, to such
effect.

(c) [Reserved].

(d) The Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Securities Intermediary, the Account Holder and each
other Eligible Institution with whom a Designated Account is
maintained waives any right of set-off, counterclaim, security
interest or bankers’ lien to which it might otherwise be
entitled.

foregoing, if a Monthly Remittance Condition is unsatisfied, the

include a remittance schedule utilized by the Servicer at a time
when the Monthly Remittance Conditions were satisfied), if the
Servicer provides to the Indenture Trustee written confirmation
from the Rating Agencies that such alternative remittance schedule
will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal by the
 
24


Rating Agencies of the ratings then assigned to

notwithstanding. The Servicer shall provide notice of any merger,
consolidation or succession pursuant to this
Section 6.02 to the Rating Agencies.

Section 6.03 Limitation on
Liability of Servicer and Others .

(a) Neither the Servicer nor any of
the directors or officers or employees or agents of the Servicer

or the Certificateholders, except as specifically provided in this
Agreement and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
pursuant to this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture or the Trust Agreement or for errors in judgment;
provided , however , that this provision shall not

faith or negligence (except errors in judgment) in the performance
of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and
duties under this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture, the Trust Agreement or any other Basic Document. The

any Person respecting any matters arising under this Agreement or
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

(y) ) incurred by reason of such trustee’s willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors in judgment)
(gross negligence in the case of the Owner Trustee) in the
performance of such trustee’s duties under this Agreement,
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust
Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement. In no event, however, shall the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee be liable to the Servicer
for any damages in the nature of special, indirect or consequential
damages, however styled, including lost profits.

shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action that is not incidental to its duties to service
the Receivables in accordance with this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in
any expense or liability; provided , however , that
the Servicer may undertake any reasonable action that it may deem
necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement or the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties to
this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
interests of the Noteholders and the Certificateholders under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the interests of
the Noteholders under the Indenture and the interests of the

amounts permitted for reimbursement pursuant to
Section 6.03(c) not therefor reimbursed;
provided , however , that the Applicable Trustee

such Distribution Date) is greater than zero but less than the
Specified Reserve Account Balance for such Distribution
Date.

duties under this Agreement or under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement to any corporation or other Person 25% or more of the
voting stock (or, if not a corporation, other voting interests) of
which is owned, directly or indirectly, by General Motors or Ally
Financial. The Servicer may at any time perform specific duties as
Servicer through sub-contractors who are in the business of
servicing motor vehicle related receivables; provided, however,
that no such delegation or sub-contracting shall relieve the
Servicer of its responsibility with respect to such
duties.

Section 6.05 Servicer Not to
Resign . Subject to the provisions of Section 7.02
, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
imposed on it by this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement as Servicer except upon determination that the
performance of its duties under this Agreement or under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, as the case may be, is no longer
permissible under applicable law. Any such determination permitting
the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel to such effect delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee. If, at the time of resignation, a successor Servicer
has not accepted appointment as Servicer, the Indenture Trustee
shall assume the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer
in accordance with Section 7.02 .

ARTICLE VII

DEFAULT

Section 7.01 Servicer
Defaults . Each of the following shall constitute a “
Servicer Default ”:

(a) any failure by the Servicer to
deliver to the Indenture Trustee for deposit in any of the
Designated Accounts any required payment or to direct the Indenture
Trustee to make any required distributions therefrom, which failure
continues unremedied for a period of five (5) Business Days
after written notice is received by the Servicer from the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee or after discovery of such failure by
an officer of the Servicer;

(b) failure on the part of the
Servicer to duly observe or perform in any material respect any
other covenants or agreements of the Servicer set forth in this
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or
the Trust Agreement which failure (i) materially and adversely
affects the rights of Noteholders or Certificateholders, and
(ii) continues unremedied for a period of ninety
(90) days after the date on which written notice of such
failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given
to the Servicer by the Indenture Trustee
 
28


or the Owner Trustee, or to the Servicer and to
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee by Noteholders whose
Notes evidence not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the
Controlling Class as of the close of the preceding Distribution
Date or if no Notes are Outstanding, by Certificateholders whose
Certificates evidence not less than 25% of the Voting Interests as
of the close of the preceding Distribution Date;

(c) the entry of a decree or order
by a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction
in the premises for the appointment of a conservator, receiver or
liquidator for the Servicer, in any insolvency, readjustment of
debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings,
or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the
continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for
a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; or

(d) the consent by the Servicer to
the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any
insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
liabilities, or similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer
or of or relating to substantially all of its property; or the
Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of
any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend
payment of its obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there
shall be no Servicer Default where a Servicer Default would
otherwise exist under clause (a)  above for a period of
an additional ten (10) Business Days or under clause
(b)  for a period of an additional sixty (60) days if
the delay or failure giving rise to the Servicer Default was caused
by an act of God or other similar occurrence. Upon the occurrence
of any of these events, the Servicer shall not be relieved from
using its best efforts to perform its obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and this Agreement, and the Servicer shall provide the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Depositor and the
Securityholders prompt notice of the failure or delay by it,
together with a description of its efforts to so perform its
obligations.

Section 7.02 Consequences of a
Servicer Default . If a Servicer Default shall occur and be
continuing, either the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders whose
Notes evidence not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount
of the Controlling Class as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date (or, if the Notes have been paid in full and the
Indenture has been discharged in accordance with its terms, by the
Owner Trustee or the Majority Certificateholders as of the close of
the preceding Distribution Date) by notice then given in writing to
the Servicer and the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture Trustee if
given by the Noteholders or the Certificateholders) may terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. On or after the
receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the
Certificates or the Receivables or otherwise, shall pass to and be
vested in the Indenture Trustee pursuant to and under this
Section 7.02 . The Indenture Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents
and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of the Receivables and related documents, or otherwise.
The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the
 
29


Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the
Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, including the transfer to the Indenture Trustee or the
Owner Trustee for administration by it of all cash amounts that
shall at the time be held by the Servicer for deposit, or that
shall have been deposited by the Servicer in the Collection
Account, or the Note Distribution Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Receivables that shall at that time be held by
the Servicer.

Section 7.03 Indenture Trustee to
Act; Appointment of Successor . On and after the time the
Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.02 , the Indenture Trustee shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as
servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for in this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and shall be
subject to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the
Collection Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been
entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of termination
had been given including the Basic Servicing Fee, Investment
Earnings and Supplemental Servicing Fees. Notwithstanding the
above, the Indenture Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling so to
act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a successor
(i) having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000,
(ii) which has a long term unsecured debt rating that falls
within an investment grade category by Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. or is otherwise acceptable to
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc.) and
(iii) whose regular business includes the servicing of motor
vehicle related receivables, as the successor to the Servicer under
this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in the
assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or
liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor out of payments on Receivables
as it and such successor shall agree; provided ,
however , that no such compensation shall be in excess of
that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. The Indenture Trustee and such successor
shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession. Costs associated with the
resignation of the Servicer and the appointment of a successor
Servicer will be paid by the Indenture Trustee from amounts in the
Trust Estate. 

Section 7.04 Notification to
Noteholders and Certificateholders . Upon any termination of,
or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this
Article VII , the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt
written notice thereof to the Noteholders and the Depositor, who
promptly shall provide such notice to the Rating Agencies, and the
Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Certificateholders.

Section 7.05 Waiver of Past
Defaults . Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less than a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Class as of
the close of the preceding Distribution Date (or, if all of the
Notes have been paid in full and the Indenture has been discharged
in accordance with its terms, the Majority Certificateholders as of
the close of the preceding Distribution Date) may, on behalf of all
Noteholders and Certificateholders, waive any
 
30


default by the Servicer in the performance of
its obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a default in
making any required deposits to or payments from any of the
Designated Accounts in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any
such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist,
and any Servicer Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.01 Optional Purchase of
All Receivables; Insolvency of the Depositor; Termination of
Trust .

the Optional Purchase Percentage or less of the Initial Aggregate
Receivables Principal Balance. To exercise such option, the
Servicer shall (A) furnish to the Issuing Entity and the
Indenture Trustee notice of its intention to exercise such option
and of the Optional Purchase Date (such notice to be furnished not
later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the Distribution
Date related to such Optional Purchase Date) and (B) deposit

Balance plus accrued and unpaid interest.

(ii) The Servicer shall make such
deposit set forth in clause (i)(B) above in immediately
available funds on the Distribution Date related to the Optional

not satisfied on the Optional Purchase Date, such deposit shall
instead be made on the Optional Purchase Date. Upon the making of
such deposit, the Servicer shall succeed to all interests in and to
the Issuing Entity (other than the Designated Accounts).

(b) Upon any sale or other
disposition of the assets of the Issuing Entity pursuant to
Article V of the Indenture (an “ Event of Default
Sale ”), the Servicer shall instruct the Applicable
Trustee to deposit into the Collection Account from the proceeds of
such disposition the amount specified in clause SECOND of
Section 5.4(b) of the Indenture (the “ Event of
Default Proceeds ”). On the Distribution Date on which
the Event of Default Proceeds are deposited in the Collection
Account (or, if such proceeds are not so deposited on a
Distribution Date, on the Distribution Date immediately following
such deposit), the Servicer shall instruct the Applicable Trustee
to make the following deposits (after the application on such
Distribution Date of the Available Principal and the Available
Interest and funds on deposit in the Reserve Account pursuant to
Sections 4.06 and 4.07 ) from the Event of Default
Proceeds and any funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve Account
(including the proceeds of any sale of investments therein as
described in the following sentence) in the following

(i) first, to the Note Distribution
Account, for payment of interest on the Class A Notes, the
Aggregate Class A Interest Distributable Amount;

(ii) second, to the Note
Distribution Account, an amount equal to the Note Principal Balance
of the Class A Notes (after giving effect to the reduction in
the Note Principal Balance to result fro
