Walmart® Credit Card


                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment.

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

EXHIBIT 10.2
EXECUTION COPY
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of March 4, 2005 (the
"Effective
Date") by and between Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc.
(the
"Company"), and Mark D. Klein ("Executive").
IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and the mutual covenants set
forth
below, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Employment. The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive
as
the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and
Executive hereby
accepts such employment, on the terms and conditions hereinafter
set forth.
2. Term. The period of employment of Executive by the
Company
under this Agreement (the "Employment Period") shall commence on
April 1, 2005
(the "Commencement Date") and shall continue through the second
(2nd)
anniversary thereof; provided, that, on the second anniversary
of the
Commencement Date and on each anniversary thereafter, the
Employment Period
shall automatically be extended for one (1) additional year
unless either party
gives written notice to the other party not to extend this
Agreement at least
ninety (90) days prior to the end of the Employment Period. The
Employment
Period may be sooner terminated by either party in accordance
with Section 6 of
this Agreement.
3. Position and Duties. During the Employment Period,
Executive
shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, and shall
report solely and directly to the Board of Directors of the
Company (the
"Board"). Executive shall have those powers and duties normally
associated with
the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of
entities comparable to
the Company and such other powers and duties as may be
prescribed by the Board;
provided, that, such other powers and duties are consistent with
Executive's
position as President and Chief Executive Officer. Executive
shall devote his
full business time to satisfactorily perform his duties and
responsibilities for
the Company hereunder. Notwithstanding the above, Executive
shall be permitted,
to the extent such activities do not substantially interfere
with the
performance by Executive of his duties and responsibilities
hereunder, to (i)
manage Executive's personal, financial and legal affairs, and
(ii) to serve on
civic or charitable boards or committees (it being expressly
understood and
agreed that Executive's continuing to serve on any such board
and/or committees
on which Executive is serving, or with which Executive is
otherwise associated,
as of the Commencement Date, (all of which are listed on
Schedule A hereto),
shall be deemed not to interfere with the performance by
Executive of his duties
and responsibilities under this Agreement). During the
Employment Period, the
Company will use its best efforts to cause Executive to be
nominated to serve as
a director of the Company, and Executive agrees to serve as a
director of the
Company, without additional compensation. During the Employment
Period,
Executive also shall serve as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of the
Company's subsidiary, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
("Ladenburg").
<PAGE>
4. Place of Performance. The principal place of employment
of
Executive shall be at the Company's principal executive offices
in Manhattan,
New York.
5. Compensation and Related Matters.
(a) Base Salary and Bonus. During the Employment Period, the
Company shall pay Executive a base salary at the rate of not
less than $500,000
per year ("Base Salary"). Executive's Base Salary shall be paid
in approximately
equal installments in accordance with the Company's customary
payroll practices.
The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") shall
review
Executive's Base Salary for increase (but not decrease) no less
frequently than
annually and consistent with the compensation practices and
guidelines of the
Company. If Executive's Base Salary is increased by the Company,
such increased
Base Salary shall then constitute the Base Salary for all
purposes of this
Agreement.
(b) Bonus. In addition to Base Salary, Executive shall be
eligible
to be paid an annual bonus of $500,000 per year (the "Bonus"),
based upon the
achievement of performance goals which have been agreed to by
the parties. For
the first year of the Term (the twelve months following the
Commencement Date),
the performance goals shall be: preparation of a business plan
and operating
budget; review and evaluation of current personnel and
development of management
incentive program; origination of at least $1 million of gross
revenue from any
source (including existing sources if generated by new hires or
if in excess of
amount generated from that source in previous year, by any
employees) (for the
avoidance of doubt, there shall be no offset against this amount
if revenue from
existing sources is lost). For the second year of the Term
(which shall for
bonus purposes be coterminous with the first full fiscal year
that begins and
ends during the Term), and each full fiscal year thereafter (if
any),
performance goals shall be set by Executive and reasonably
agreed to by the
Committee. In addition, Executive shall be eligible for such
additional bonuses
as may be determined by the Board.
(c) Expenses. The Company shall promptly reimburse Executive
for
all reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by
Executive in
performing his duties hereunder upon the presentation of
reasonably itemized
statements of such expenses in accordance with the Company's
policies and
procedures now in force or as such policies and procedures may
be modified with
respect to all senior executive officers of the Company.
(d) Vacation. Executive shall be entitled five (5) weeks
vacation
annually. Unused vacation may be carried forward from year to
year. In addition
to vacation, Executive shall be entitled to the number of sick
days and personal
days per year that other senior executive officers of the
Company are entitled
under the Company's policies.
(e) Services Furnished. During the Employment Period, the
Company
shall furnish Executive, with office space, secretarial
assistance and such
other similar facilities and services on a basis that is
reasonably determined
by Executive.
(f) Director and Officer Liability Insurance. During the
Employment Period, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to
obtain and maintain adequate
2
<PAGE>
officer and director liability insurance in such amounts as the
Board shall so
determine (which in no event shall be less than $5,000,000)
(provided the
Company shall not be required to expend on an annual basis more
than 125% of the
amount expended in 2004 for such coverage). Executive shall be
covered at all
times by such policy in all of his capacities with the Company.
In addition, for
a period of six (6) years after the Date of Termination, the
Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect one or
more policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance with respect to
any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising from facts or
events which
occurred during the Executive's employment with the Company and
such policy or
policies shall be with a carrier or carriers reasonably
satisfactory to the
parties intended to be benefited thereby and with limits,
exclusions,
deductibles, and other characteristics no less favorable than
those in place on
the date Executive ceased being an employee of the Company
(provided the Company
shall not be required to expend on an annual basis more than
125% of the amount
expended in 2004 for such coverage). Any and all such policies
shall be issued
by leading insurance carriers and shall otherwise be in form and
substance
reasonably satisfactory to those persons who are officers and
directors of the
Company as of the date hereof. The provisions of this clause (f)
shall survive
termination of this Agreement and/or any termination of
Executive's employment
with the Company.
(g) Welfare, Pension and Employee Benefit Plans. During the
Employment Period, Executive (and his spouse and dependents to
the extent
provided therein) shall be entitled to participate in and be
covered under all
the welfare benefit plans or programs maintained by the Company
from time to
time for the benefit of its senior executives including, without
limitation, all
medical, hospitalization, dental, disability, accidental death
and dismemberment
and travel accident insurance plans and programs. The Company
shall at all times
provide to Executive (and his spouse and dependents to the
extent provided under
the applicable plans or programs) (subject to modifications
affecting all senior
executive officers) the same type and levels of participation
and benefits as
are being provided to other senior executives (and their spouses
and dependents
to the extent provided under the applicable plans or programs)
on the
Commencement Date. In addition, during the Employment Period,
Executive shall be
eligible to participate in all pension, retirement, savings and
other employee
benefit plans and programs maintained from time to time by the
Company for the
benefit of its senior executives. During the Employment Period,
the Company
shall maintain a term life insurance policy for the benefit of
Executive which
provides for a death benefit of at least $2,000,000 and a
long-term disability
insurance plan which provides Executive with disability benefits
equal to at
least 60% of his average annual compensation until Executive is
at least age 65.
Executive represents that he is no worse than a "standard risk"
for an insured
party.
(h) Stock Options.
(i) Grant of Stock Option. On the date of this Agreement,
the Company hereby grants to Executive a stock option to
purchase 5,000,000
shares of Company common stock (the "Option") at an exercise
price per share
equal to $.465 pursuant to the terms of the option agreement
executed
simultaneously herewith ("Option Agreement"). The Option shall

comparable
plan.

the Option shall vest as to 10% of the shares subject thereto on
the date of

anniversaries of the date of grant.
(iii) Adjustment. The Option shall be subject to adjustment
for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions to
preserve the
economic intent of such grant.
(iv) Term of Option. Subject to the terms of the Option
Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for 10 years from
the date of
grant.
(v) Treatment of Option upon Termination of Employment. In
the event that Executive's employment is terminated by reason of
his death,
Disability (as defined below), by the Company without Cause (as
defined below)
or by Executive for Good Reason (as defined below), all unvested
Options that
would have vested had Executive remained employed for the
remainder of the then
current Employment Period shall immediately vest and all
outstanding Options
shall remain exercisable for a period of one (1) year following
Executive's
termination of employment, but not beyond their term.
(vi) Treatment of Option upon Change in Control. In the
event
of a Change in Control (as defined herein), Executive's Options
shall
immediately vest and become exercisable and remain exercisable
for the remainder
of the term of the Options.
(vii) Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
Registration.
The Company agrees to file an appropriate registration statement
with the SEC
covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Option
and the re-sale
of the shares subject to such Option.
(i) Sale of Shares. As further inducement for Executive to
enter
into this Agreement, the Company has authorized the sale to
Executive of
2,222,222 shares of its common stock at $.45 per share (for an
aggregate
purchase price of $1 million) pursuant to the terms of a
subscription agreement
executed simultaneously herewith ("Subscription Agreement").
Pursuant to the
terms of the Subscription Agreement, the closing of the purchase
of the shares
shall occur simultaneously with the Company's previously
announced debt
conversion and private placement.
(j) Legal Expenses. The Company will pay Executive for all
reasonable legal fees and expenses in connection with the
preparation of this
Agreement and any agreements related thereto.
6. Termination. Executive's employment hereunder may be
terminated during the Employment Period under the following
circumstances:
(a) Death. Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate
upon his death.
(b) Disability. If, as a result of Executive's incapacity
due
to physical or mental illness, Executive shall have been
substantially unable to
perform his normal duties hereunder for an entire period of six
(6) consecutive
months, and within thirty (30) days after
4
<PAGE>
written Notice of Termination is given after such six (6) month
period,
Executive shall not have returned to the substantial performance
of his duties
on a full-time basis, the Company shall have the right to
terminate Executive's
employment hereunder for "Disability", and such termination in
and of itself
shall not be, nor shall it be deemed to be, a breach of this
Agreement.
(c) Cause. The Company shall have the right to terminate
Executive's employment for Cause, and such termination in and of
itself shall
not be, nor shall it be deemed to be, a breach of this
Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, the Company shall have "Cause" to terminate
Executive's
employment upon Executive's: (i) conviction of a felony, (ii)
alcoholism or drug
addiction which materially impairs his ability to perform his
duties hereunder,
(iii) continued, intentional and willful failure to
substantially and materially
perform his material duties hereunder (other than absences due
to illness or
vacation) after the Board provides Executive a written notice
specifically
identifying the manner in which Executive has failed to
materially perform his
duties and Executive has not cured such failure within 30 days
of such notice,
or (iv) willful and deliberate misconduct that results, or is
reasonably likely
to result, in material and demonstrative harm to the Company or
any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates.
For purposes of this Section 6(c), no act, or failure to act, by
Executive shall
be considered "willful" unless committed in bad faith and
without a reasonable
belief that the act or omission was in the best interests of the
Company or any
entity in control of, controlled by or under common control with
the Company
("Affiliates") thereof. Cause shall not exist under clause (iii)
unless and
until the Board determines that Executive was guilty of the
conduct set forth in
clause (iii). This Section 6(c) shall not prevent Executive from
challenging in
any arbitration or court of competent jurisdiction the Board's
determination
that Cause exists or that Executive has failed to cure any act
(or failure to
act) that purportedly formed the basis for the Board's
determination.
(d) Good Reason. Executive may terminate his employment for
"Good Reason" any time after Executive has actual knowledge of
the occurrence,
without the written consent of Executive, of one of the
following events:
(i) (A) any change in the duties or responsibilities
(including reporting responsibilities) of Executive that is
inconsistent
in any material adverse respect with Executive's position(s),
duties,
responsibilities or status with the Company (or Ladenburg)
immediately
prior to such change (including any diminution of such duties
or
responsibilities) or (B) a material adverse change in
Executive's titles
or offices with the (including, membership on the Board) with
the Company
(or Ladenburg);
(ii) a reduction in Executive's Base Salary or Bonus;
(iii) the relocation of the Company's principal
executive offices or Executive's own office location to a
location outside
of Manhattan, New York;
(iv) the Company's or any Affiliate's failure to provide
in all material respects the indemnification set forth in
the
Indemnification Agreement entered into by the Company and
Executive on the
date of this Agreement;
5
<PAGE>
(v) a Change in Control of the Company, provided, that
Executive must provide Notice of Termination within 90 days of
such Change
of Control;
(vi) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption
agreement from any successor as contemplated in Section 12(a);
or
(vii) any other breach of a material provision of this
Agreement by the Company or any Affiliate after written notice
from
Executive specifically identifying the breach and the Company
has not
cured such breach within 30 days of such notice.
Executive's continued employment shall not constitute consent
to, or a waiver of
rights with respect to, any event or condition constituting Good
Reason.
(e) Without Cause. The Company shall have the right to
terminate Executive's employment hereunder without Cause by
providing Executive
with a Notice of Termination, and such termination shall not in
and of itself
be, nor shall it be deemed to be, a breach of this
Agreement.
(f) Without Good Reason. Executive shall have the right to
terminate his employment hereunder without Good Reason by
providing the Company
with a Notice of Termination at least thirty (30) days prior to
such
termination, and such termination shall not in and of itself be,
nor shall it be
deemed to be, a breach of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of the
Company means the
occurrence of one of the following events: (i) consummation of a
reorganization,
merger or consolidation, sale, disposition of all or
substantially all of the
assets or stock of the Company or any other similar corporate
event (a "Business
Combination"), in each case, unless, following such Business
Combination, all or
substantially all of the individuals or entities who were the
beneficial owners,
respectively, of the voting securities of the Company entitled
to vote generally
in the election of directors immediately prior to such Business
Combination
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of,
respectively, the
then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in
the election of
directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from
such Business
Combination (including, without limitation, a corporation which
as a result of
such transaction owns the Company or all or substantially all of
the Company's
assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries); or
(ii) Board
approval of a complete dissolution or liquidation of the
Company; or (iii) any
"person" (as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the
Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and as used in Sections
13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2)
of the Exchange Act), other than Dr. Phillip Frost, any member
of his immediate
family, and any "person" or "group" (as used in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange
Act) that is controlled by Dr. Frost or any member of his
immediate family, any
beneficiary of the estate of Dr. Frost, or any trust,
partnership, corporation
or other entity

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
