				How Do I Maintain It?			

 
SUNation offers only high-efficiency, premium-quality solar panels with expert workmanship and installation. For the most part, solar systems of this quality require little maintenance over their lifespan, if any at all. The components we install all come with full 25-year warranties, inverters included, that protect you in the event of the slightest malfunction. SUNation installs monitoring hardware on every system that allows us and our homeowners to know when anything is wrong.

			×            





				How Much Does it Cost?			

 
One of the most common misconceptions when purchasing a solar system is that it’s going to be expensive. In reality, over 96% of our customers experience Zero Out Of Pocket costs. While financing the cost of a system up front is the best way to realize all the savings that solar offers, SUNation offers low and no-interest loans that make going solar one of the most affordable decisions you’ll ever make.

				Referral Program – Refer A Friend Today			

 
At SUNation, our customers become a part of our family. For us, a customer referral is the highest compliment we can receive for the work we do. And, when you refer a friend, neighbor or family member you’re saving us advertising dollars. We’d rather see your family get a check than send one out for advertising.
For each person you refer to us that goes solar, we’ll send you $500 after their system is installed. When your third recommendation goes solar with SUNation, that referral fee goes up to $1,000 and you’ll continue to get $1,000 for everybody you send to us from then on. And you thought you were just saving on electricity!

MANAGEMENT TEAM







Scott Maskin
Co-Founder/CEO
View Bio 


Scott Maskin
Co-Founder/CEO
Scott Maskin co-founded SUNation Solar Systems in 2003 and currently serves as President and CEO. As the company operations leader, his hands-on approach has driven SUNation’s growth and branding. Scott has a PhD from the School of Hard knocks. From 1980-1987 Scott traveled as an electrician and pyrotechnician for large touring musical, theatrical and industrial tours. The climate of conquering insurmountable tasks on a daily basis honed Scott’s organizational and communication skills and laid the foundation for everything that was to follow. Post 1987, Scott worked as a traditional electrician and obtained his Master Electrician’s license in 1994 and went out on his own. The next 18 years were filled with countless electrical and general contracting projects including hotels, large retail box stores, restaurants and thousands of residential installations. Just completing projects was never enough for Scott. Being a complete solution provider and never forgetting the importance of total customer satisfaction, will always be paramount to Scott. Solar became a passion and a direction in 2001. The mission of making the world a better place for his family, friends and fellow Long Islanders gave birth to what SUNation is, a collaborative of like-minded people who enjoy similar passions for family, the workplace and the environment. When not acting as Captain on the SUNation ship, Scott is an avid family man spending time boating, beaching and skiing and just enjoying what experiences come his way.

Mike Bailis
Co-Founder/Chief of Sales
As Co-Founder and Chief Sales Officer at SUNation Solar Systems, Mike Bailis oversees all revenue-generating business, including sales and marketing in both the residential and commercial markets.  With nearly 40 years of experience in energy sales, Bailis has worked in the HVAC business since 1982 and is a recognized expert in the solar industry.  Early in his career, Bailis noticed the problems the U.S. faced with its first major energy crisis, specifically with the importing and use of fossil fuels.  He recognized that we cannot depend on these limited resources we have that we have no control over and saw solar as a viable solution as the sun is free, readily available, and under-utilized.

It is Bailis’ goal at SUNation to assist homeowners and businesses in our region to see the benefits of solar and to help our community transition from a carbon-based economy to a renewable energy economy.
Bailis is the former vice chairman of the Long Island Solar Energy Industry Association (LISEIA) as well as a board member of NYSEIA.  He is a graduate of SUNY Cortland with a BS in Economics.  When not totally consumed with running his solar business, he tries to find some down time playing tennis, golf, fishing and playing poker.
“I have enough interests and activities to retire, just not the time or desire at this time, there are just so many more homes and businesses that need solar and just 24 hours in a day.”

                           Most scholars have viewed property in pre-modern Ethiopia in ⁰́feudal⁰́₊ terms analogous to medieval Europe. According to
                              them, Ethiopia⁰́₉s past property arrangement had been in every respect archaic implying less than complete property rights,
                              for, unlike in modern liberal societies, it vested no ownership or ⁰́₋absolute⁰́₊ rights in a single individual over a material
                              object. By draining any notions of ownership right, historians therefore characterized the forms of property through which
                              the Ethiopian elites supported themselves as ⁰́₋fief-holding⁰́₊ or rights of lordship, which merely entitled them to collect
                              tribute from the subject peasantry. By using land registers, surveys, charters, and private property transactions, which I
                              collected from Ethiopian churches and monasteries, this dissertation challenges this conception of property in premodern Ethiopia
                              by arguing that Ethiopian elites did exercise ownership rights over the land, thus providing them a means by which to control
                              the peasantry. Through the concepts of rim (a form of private property in land exclusively held by social elites) and zéga
                              (a hitherto unrecognized serf-like laborers), I explore the economic and social relationship between rulers and ruled that
                              defined political culture in premodern Ethiopia. As a norm rim derived from confiscated peasant property and it mediated or
                              exposed the social dependence of the zéga class on the ruling class. Rim together with zéga emphasize that the peasants
                              were far less independent and secure in their property rights than conventional portrayals, while indicating the ability of
                              rulers to create a sharply defined social distance for the maintenance of a land tenure system that supported harsh exploitation
                              and domination

Contracting with reading costs and renegotiation costs by

                           In the economy, contract formation and recontracting are costly, and these costs have important implications for contractual
                              outcomes and economic objectives like efficiency. In this dissertation, I characterize systematically how reading costs and
                              renegotiation costs affect contracting behavior, and I describe how third-party enforcement, conducted by institutions such
                              as courts, might ameliorate efficiency problems associated with both types of costly contracting. Chapter I contains analysis
                              of contracting and costly renegotiation using mechanism-design. The Renegotiation-Proofness Principle (RPP) is formalized:
                              any state-contingent payoff vector that is implementable with renegotiation is also implemented by a mechanism in which renegotiation
                              does not occur in equilibrium. The RPP is not valid. However, our more general monotonicity result confirms the RPP's "renegotiation
                              is bad" message, because it shows the set of implementable state-contingent payoffs becomes larger as the costs of renegotiation
                              increase. In the model of Chapter II, a buyer must incur a reading cost to understand payoffs sellers' contracts promise.
                              An equilibrium with reading with reading exists in which the buyer reads offers with positive probability. Further monotonicity
                              results characterize how the equilibrium depends two enforcement features. Increasing the lowest enforceable payoff reduces
                              the equilibrium reading investment and encourages acceptance. And, reducing reading costs increases the buyer's reading probability,
                              though the total reading investment is kept low. I indicate several existing institutional rules that limit contract payoffs
                              or reduce reading costs. The penalty doctrine restricts private damages not to exceed harm; substantive unconscionability
                              effectively excuses performance for a low payoff; and procedural unconscionability and disclosure regulations reduce reading
                              costs. In Chapter III, interaction between a seller who offers a standard form contract and a buyer who reads it--under two-sided
                              asymmetric information--reveals reading costs are not incurred in equilibrium. Payoff-based limitations on enforceable contracts
                              therefore play a vital role in agreement, since any accepted contract will not have been read. An example and general discussion
                              relate expected surplus generated in a no-reading equilibrium to contract payoff boundaries defined by enforcement

                              This dissertation explores the construction of the pan-Africanist and socialist discourse of Kwame Nkrumah⁰́₉s government⁰́₄Ghana⁰́₉s
                                 first independent government⁰́₄during the nation-building project of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, when Ghana became independent,
                                 the country⁰́₉s transition to self-rule emerged as a watershed moment in African and world history as this small West African
                                 country challenged an international community rooted in the political and institutional framework of the territorial nation-state
                                 with a radical program of pan-African liberation and global socialist development. By 1958, the Nkrumah government⁰́₉s commitment
                                 to this radical program had resulted in supra-territorial federations with Guinea-Conakry and later Mali, while, at home,
                                 Nkrumah and his Convention People⁰́₉s Party (CPP) presented the nascent nation as a model for a new form of modern, disciplined,
                                 and continental citizenship. Based on eighteen months of oral and archival research in Ghana, this dissertation reconstructs
                                 the development and performance of Nkrumah⁰́₉s program of pan-African liberation and socialist development in the Ghanaian
                                 public sphere. In doing so, it interrogates the role of pan-Africanism and global socialism in shaping a vision of a growing
                                 modern, disciplined, and socialist citizenry within the Nkrumahist state. Moreover, through an examination of the press, youth,
                                 women⁰́₉s, and workers⁰́₉ organizations, this dissertation traces how key groups of both ⁰́elite⁰́₊ and ⁰́₋ordinary⁰́₊ Ghanaians
                                 embedded aspects of Nkrumahist ideology into existing idioms of power, corruption, and progress in their communities as they
                                 sought to negotiate the increasingly volatile realities associated with life in postcolonial Africa. As a result, I argue
                                 that, through the institutional framework of Nkrumah-era pan-Africanist and socialist politics, an interactive debate developed
                                 within Nkrumah⁰́₉s Ghana whereby an eclectic array of Ghanaian men and women came together to debate and contest their changing
                                 places, roles, and responsibilities in the postcolonial nation. Such an analysis, I contend, provides a framework for understanding
                                 decolonization and nation-building in Africa not as the elite program of political re-organization that most scholars have
                                 portrayed it as, but as part of a dynamic set of local and transnational imaginings and contestations aimed at addressing
                                 the challenges and inequities associated with Africa⁰́₉s transition to self-rule

                              "Cellular self-assembly is a process that occurs during embryonic development in which cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)
                                 spontaneously organize into three-dimensional (3D) tissues in the absence of external forces. Cellular self-assembly can also
                                 be initiated in vitro, and represents a potential tool for tissue engineers to organize cells and ECM in an in vivo-like manner.
                                 Understanding the cell-ECM interactions that lead to the formation of 3D cellular structures will better allow tissue engineers
                                 to develop biological constructs in vitro for regenerative medicine purposes. Fibronectin is an ECM protein that plays an
                                 important role in tissue formation during embryonic development as well as 3D cellular self-assembly in vitro. Our lab has
                                 developed a series of fibronectin matrix mimetic proteins that mimic many of the cellular effects of the bioactive, ECM form
                                 of fibronectin. The goal of this work was use fibronectin matrix mimetics to identify the cell-fibronectin interactions that
                                 lead to cellular self-assembly. In this work, we showed that fibronectin matrix mimetic substrates are able to stimulate fibronectin-dependent
                                 cellular self-assembly. The fibronectin matrix mimetic substrate conditions that permit cellular self-assembly are dependent
                                 on the cell-substrate binding strength. We have identified roles for fibronectin matrix assembly and Rac GTPase in mediating
                                 cell-substrate binding strength and subsequently cellular self-assembly. These findings were then applied to tissue engineering
                                 applications. We showed that fibronectin matrix mimetics are also able to control cellular self-assembly of mesenchymal stem
                                 cells (MSCs) and stimulate early osteogenic differentiation based on substrate coating concentration. The studies presented
                                 herein suggest that fibronectin matrix mimetics provide a model for studying the role that fibronectin matrix assembly and
                                 cell-substrate binding strength play in stimulating tissue development"--Pages iv-v

                              'Contemporary Africa is demographically characterized above all else by its youthfulness. In East Africa the median age of
                                 the population is now a striking 17.5 years, and more than 65 percent of the population is age 24 or under. This situation
                                 has attracted growing scholarly attention, resulting in an important and rapidly expanding literature on the position of youth
                                 in African societies. While the scholarship examining the contemporary role of youth in African societies is rich and growing,
                                 the historical dimension has been largely neglected in the literature thus far. Generations Past seeks to address this gap
                                 through a wide-ranging selection of essays that covers an array of youth-related themes in historical perspective. Thirteen
                                 chapters explore the historical dimensions of youth in nineteenth-, twentieth-, and twenty-first-century Ugandan, Tanzanian,
                                 and Kenyan societies. Key themes running through the book include the analytical utility of youth as a social category; intergenerational
                                 relations and the passage of time; youth as a social and political problem; sex and gender roles among East African youth;
                                 and youth as historical agents of change. The strong list of contributors includes prominent scholars of the region, and the
                                 collection encompasses a good geographical spread of all three East African countries.'--on cover

 This book enables you to plan, cost, negotiate, and execute favorable warranty contracts. Whether you're the supplier offering a warranty or the customer receiving it, knowing its potential costs and benefits can prove crucial to your bottom line. Written by a well-known warranty authority, James R. Brennan's "Warranties: Planning, Analysis, and Implementation" demonstrates how to develop and negotiate credible, mutually-beneficial warranties to satisfy today's commercial and government customers alike. Establishing the criteria for a good warranty, it draws on real-world case examples to illustrate basic warranty: principles; risks; requirements; tradeoffs; costing; negotiating; administration; planning/management; and more.

From the Back Cover


Plan, Cost, Negotiate, and Execute Favorable Warranty Contracts. Whether you're the supplier offering a warranty or the customer receiving it, knowing its potential costs and benefits can prove crucial to your bottom line. Written by a well-known warranty authority, James R. Brennan's Warranties: Planning, Analysis, and Implementation demonstrates how to develop and negotiate credible, mutually-beneficial warranties to satisfy today's commercial and government customers alike. Establishing the criteria for a good warranty, it draws on real-world case examples to illustrate basic warranty: principles; risks; requirements; tradeoffs; costing; negotiating; administration; planning/management; and more.

The basic concepts of course apply to B2B suppliers as well, but it is difficult and frustrating to constantly have to stretch to relate the concepts and techniques to the private sector.  My biggest complaint is the author's constant use of abbreviations and acronyms.  I found myself having to keep a running glossary of his terms (MTBF, EPR, LSC, to mention a few) just to understand what he was talking about.  In general, it is a good book for gaining a basic understanding of supplier warranties, but don't expect it to give you a lot of insight into developing your own.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsIt really depends..........ByA customeron June 13, 2000Format: HardcoverThe contents of this book is generally OK in terms of informative and educational. It gives you the  general ideas of what warranty is all about. But one drawback, as I put my title, if you are in a  private business, you  might be dispointed because significant portion of this book is on  Government businesses - Army, DOT,Air Force, etc., Especially on the  "Warranty Costing"; but if you are in Government, then you will  find it relevant and helpful.Read more0Comment|
