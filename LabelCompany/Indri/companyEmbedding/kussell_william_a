Description


Additional information



Description
William Russell graduated from the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Norwich, Vermont, in 1828.  As he foresaw the coming of the Civil War, he opened a prep school for boys where he introduced military drill and discipline.  He was hired by the governor of Connecticut to organize and become the commander of the Connecticut state militia.  The state legislature made him a major general of the militia.  Russell was active in the organization of the new Republican Party and was a personal friend of John Brown.  Upon Brown’s execution, Russell served as the trustee of his will. Russell was also one of the founders of the Skull and Bones Society at Yale University.
This William Russell mug is part of our Civil War Series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed HistoryMugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

11 oz. mug:  3.75” H x 3” D
15 oz. mug:  4.5″ H x 3.25″ D
Mugs are premium hard coated ceramic, which are food and microwave safe.
To preserve photographic quality we recommend hand washing.
Mugs are usually shipped within 3-5 days.

other and enhance this tribute for future generations.
