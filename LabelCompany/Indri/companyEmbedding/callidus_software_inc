CallidusCloud is the global leader in cloud-based sales, marketing, learning, and customer experience solutions. CallidusCloud enables organizations to accelerate and maximize their lead to money process with a complete suite of solutions that identify the right leads, ensure proper territory and quota distribution, enable sales forces, automate configure price quote, and streamline sales compensation — driving bigger deals, faster. Over 5,400 organizations, across all industries, rely on CallidusCloud to optimize the lead to money process to close more deals for more money in record time.
 
CallidusCloud Aligns Your Sales & Marketing Groups
Sales and marketing have similar objectives – but for too long, technology has contributed to blind spots in the journey of a lead from generation to the close (or loss) of a deal. Those blind spots, in turn fuel the antagonism between sales and marketing. In an era where the two need to work closer together than ever, technology is driving them further apart.
This is a problem that CallidusCloud addresses. First, we provide tools to automate key parts of the marketing and selling process – marketing automation, configure price quote (CPQ), territory and quota (T&Q), sales enablement, sales coaching, learning management, commissions, customer experience and incentives. Each product can be used as a stand-alone application or as part of a suite. Then, we ensure tight integration between each product in the Lead to Money Suite – when used in conjunction, their impact is magnified, and can have a revolutionary impact on a business’s sales productivity.

CallidusCloud is the global leader in cloud-based sales, marketing, learning, and customer experience solutions. CallidusCloud enables organizations to accelerate and maximize their lead to money process with a complete suite of solutions that identify the right leads, ensure proper territory and quota distribution, enable sales forces, automate configure price quote, and streamline sales compensation — driving bigger deals, faster. Over 5,400 organizations, across all industries, rely on CallidusCloud to optimize the lead to money process to close more deals for more money in record time.
 
CallidusCloud Aligns Your Sales & Marketing Groups
Sales and marketing have similar objectives – but for too long, technology has contributed to blind spots in the journey of a lead from generation to the close (or loss) of a deal. Those blind spots, in turn fuel the antagonism between sales and marketing. In an era where the two need to work closer together than ever, technology is driving them further apart.
This is a problem that CallidusCloud addresses. First, we provide tools to automate key parts of the marketing and selling process – marketing automation, configure price quote (CPQ), territory and quota (T&Q), sales enablement, sales coaching, learning management, commissions, customer experience and incentives. Each product can be used as a stand-alone application or as part of a suite. Then, we ensure tight integration between each product in the Lead to Money Suite – when used in conjunction, their impact is magnified, and can have a revolutionary impact on a business’s sales productivity.












You’re already on the way to more money,
but you could get there faster.

In 2014, total revenue was $136.6 million, an increase of $24.3 million, or 22%, from 2013. In 2015, total revenue increased 27% to $173.1 million. During 2015, the company added 900 customers to take the total number of companies using one or more of its software products to 4,600. They now report more than 5000.
Products and Services[edit]
CallidusCloud provides Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions for marketing and sales effectiveness. Their suite of solutions includes applications to identify the right leads, ensure proper territory and quota distribution, enable sales forces, automate quote and proposal generation, and streamline sales compensation. Additionally, they offer applications for customer experience monitoring, sales gamification, and learning management including content authoring.
Lead to Money core concept[edit]
The company primary focus is the Lead to Money process. They advocate optimizing every step the process to drive sales productivity and revenue. The process includes making the right sales hire, training and on boarding them efficiently, and making the deal sizes bigger through guided selling and upselling, and cross-selling. It also includes motivating sales execution with targeted incentives and rewards and building a knowledge-based work culture with high frequency coaching and development that will drive sales performance.[21] Providing the right tools to sales requires a strong understanding of the sales process. It starts with capturing Leads. Marketing automation tools maximize marketing efforts to deliver more, high-quality leads and drive revenue. Additionally, companies need to have a strategic selling plan to accurately evaluate territories and quota distribution to hit corporate goals. Approaching prospects requires streamlined sales enablement[22] processes in order to deliver the right content at the right time in the sales cycle. Accelerating and automating the quoting process maximizes deal size and closes deals faster. The last step for the process is a well-established sales incentive compensation program in place, which quickly and accurately deploy rewards programs to drive the behaviors that align with corporate objectives.

The company head quarters is located at Dublin, CA.

Software and service provider Callidus Software Inc. maintains an in house information technology group that operates autonomously from the product development team's software personnel. The data center is located at the headquarters.

Internal IT is divided into two core disciplines: R&D and IT systems. These groups handle infrastructure technologies as well as software operations. Team members within these offices are responsible for help desk operations and application integration administration. The company relies on VMware for virtualization efforts, in addition to using MS-CRM for customer relationship management solutions. Callidus also utilizes SAP software for internal software operations.
