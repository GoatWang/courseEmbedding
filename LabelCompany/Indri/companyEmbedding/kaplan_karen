WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.

 In an amused tone, Kaplan offers gentle science fiction that is sympathetic to the human condition. The first chapter, "Escapade," features Gomer and Muriel Ackerman, a retro couple in the mid-21st Century who are searching for old-fashioned values such as privacy in a twentieth-century settlement but do not get what they bargained for. In "A Dementia Returnee," their friend Virginia becomes one of the first people cured of dementia but who runs into an unexpected detour to complete health. Later in the book, Gomer's wife dies and he seeks consolation from a custom-designed robot that satisfies in some ways and does not in others. In the last chapter, Muriel’s grandniece Beatriz discovers extraterrestrials in another solar system who must be stingy with words in order to survive.  If you too are a curiosity seeker, you will find yourself with kindred spirits within this collection of interrelated stories.

About the Author


Karen B. Kaplan is not your typical science fiction writer. Thus you will find no weapons or nasty robots in her book. She has not pursued a career that at first glance would lead to science fiction. She has been a hospice chaplain for eight years, and in 2014 published true stories she heard while on the job in Encountering The Edge: What People Told Me Before They Died (Pen-L Publishing).  After that, she decided to use gentle science fiction (including a decidedly friendly robot companion) to show how a retro couple in the future would confront spiritual issues such as privacy, regrets, and getting more out of life by being curious. Her fans who could “enjoy” a book about hospice assuredly will find this one far more entertaining yet thought-provoking just the same.

KaplanByKellyMon May 4, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAs someone who enjoyed Karen Kaplan’s “Encountering the Edge,” her memoir of seven years as a hospice chaplain, I looked forward to “Curiosity Seekers” and was not disappointed. She takes clever ideas and puts unconventional characters in amusing situations. Curiosity Seekers is a collection of five stories set in our future featuring the quirky Ackermans.  Full disclosure: I’m thanked in the Acknowledgements for retweeting Karen Kaplan more than anyone else. I appreciate her thanks and after reading Curiosity Seekers, I remain a fan.“Escapade“ introduces Homer and Muriel Ackerman in the year 2045, both with their own ways of “hunkering down into the past.” Homer and Muriel are a middle-aged, contrarian, happily long-married couple, who trade gentle quips during their zany adventures. Homer restores books in an age where printed books have become scarce, replaced by “quantum-books.” Muriel creates greeting cards intended for one person, which she insists are to be hand delivered. Through one of Homer’s clients, they discover the existence of a group of “Opting Outers,” people who shun email, e-commerce, and other modern technologies. The Ackermans plan an exploratory visit to these seemingly like-minded folks and hijinks ensue. I enjoyed Kaplan’s take on the observer’s paradox: the act of observing causes changes to [that which] you observe. The Ackermans effect unexpected change in the Opting Outers, despite their efforts to fit in. I also noticed the observer’s paradox in the second and fifth stories.“A Dementia Returnee” explores the case of a friend of the Ackermans, Virginia Boyden, who is among the first to be successfully treated for dementia in the year 2053. Both this story and the next share some themes with the much lauded novel “Flowers for Algernon,” though with a much lighter tone. The story comments on how we treat people with cognitive impairment, and imagines the experience of someone recovering from the condition. Kaplan’s insight as a hospice chaplain enriches the story, and her compassion and skill at listening also shine through.“Flowers for Ackerman” - The protagonist in this story uses technology to try to forget something he/she wants to avoid processing. The story explores and comments on what our relationship with technology could become and reminds us of how that relationship has and will change. I enjoyed Kaplan’s humorous take on the matter and it’s my favorite story.“Gomer Gone Wayward” includes a flashback to a time when Gomer was asked to restore a book with troubling content and introduces the Ackermans’ niece Beatriz, who was “similar to [Gomer] and to Muriel: always in pursuit of curiosities.”“Fighting to Listen” continues Beatriz’s story in 2095 and relates her family’s adventure on the first mobile city that breaks out of orbit. Beatriz notes that, “We might be more like the Opting Outs than we care to think. They were a small community with little outside contact. Sound Familiar?” Kaplan’s masterful use of recurring themes strengthen the book and enriched my enjoyment of it.“Curiosity Seekers” encourages you to look beyond what you know and experience an optimistic future with imaginative characters. I finished the book sharing a bit of Kaplan’s contagious optimism. I’m happy that I spent time exploring with the Ackermans.Read more0Comment|

Wileyon March 5, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseOne thing I noticed is that these stories  are not so much sci-fi as social satire:  and yet such *gentle* and *amiable* satire that it nips you playfully without biting.  What a pleasant change from the present level of public yapping and snapping!I I appreciated Kaplan's unique and clever perspective.I want to thank Karen Kaplan for the gift of her writing.

However when a story grabs me, I can get through it  Such was my experience reading Curiosity Seekers. The book was fascinating and had lessons to teach on multiple levels. The story has taught me the importance of listening to others as well as our authentic selves.I look forward to rereading and further savoring the stories. Thank you Karen Kaplan and I'm anxious to read your next book!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAn intriguing look into the future.ByBluebell9on February 22, 2017Format: PaperbackI used to think that I was not a great fan of science fiction but these interrelated stories from Karen Kaplan changed my mind with a vengeance. Although full of imagination, they are firmly set in reality, albeit in a future age.A married couple, Gomer and Muriel, volunteer for a long expedition into the future, and find much to fascinate them, and us, along the way. Of especial interest to me was the initial battle between those who welcomed new technology, and those who opposed the 'new' ways. I won't reveal which group seemed to gain ground in the battle but it was very much the side I felt I was on. Hurray!Also gripping for us today was the story of Gomer's and Muriel's friend, Virginia, who recovered from dementia, with side effects that were eventually overcome. I am sure many of us will find this hopeful and heartening.A strange 'other race' was eventually discovered. This 'race' had strange ways of communication, too, and the humans felt they learnt much about a different culture, and gained a deeper understanding of themselves. These creatures even ate and drank in a different way from us - not mixing water with food. The former was sucked up into their bodies through their feet.I felt it was refreshing to find ourselves in the company of a couple of human beings, Gomer and Muriel, who were warm-hearted and humorous. Their son, who accompanied them on their travels, was also intelligent and civilised.Therapy played its part here, and I repeat my favourite quote from this fascinating and unusual book: 'It is better to be the last to listen than to have the last word'.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsQuirky and endearing characters navigate the tricky territory of relationships in a futuristic contextBykristaon February 26, 2017Format: PaperbackI have read my fair share of dystopian sci-fi, post-apocalyptic sci-fi and colossal space operas but this is an altogether different style of Science Fiction. The protagonists of the story are Gomer and Muriel Ackerman, a quirky middle-aged couple whose professions of book repair (real physical books!) and creating one-recipient-only hand-made greeting cards set them a bit at odds with the futuristic society they live in. In Gomer and Muriel’s world Alzheimer’s disease is a thing of the past, generational space travel is possible and everyone uses something called “quantum mail.” For me, however, Curiosity Seekers is more about the daily intricacies of interpersonal communication and the rich, often agonizing, nuance that relationships bring to everyday life. In the end, for all of our advancements, discoveries and technological breakthroughs, we are still just trying to figure each other out.Read more0Comment|

Home > About Karen Caplan 








KAREN CAPLAN

President and CEO
Karen Caplan knows jack…fruit, among many other exotic fruits and vegetables. After all, produce is in her blood.
Products like cherimoyas, Sunchokes®, and passion fruit may be unfamiliar to the average person, but Karen grew up eating and selling them. As the firstborn daughter of entrepreneur Dr. Frieda Rapoport Caplan, founder of Frieda’s Specialty Produce, Karen began working with produce at the age of 10.
After graduating with a degree in Agricultural Economics and Business Management from the University of California-Davis, Karen joined Frieda’s full time. Learning the business from the ground up, Karen worked in just about every department at the company, from packing boxes to sales and marketing. At age 30, Karen was promoted to president and CEO. In 1990 Karen and her sister, Jackie Caplan Wiggins, purchased the company from their mother. With Karen at the helm and Jackie by her side, Frieda’s became the nation’s leading marketer and distributor of specialty produce.
A well-respected leader in the produce industry, Karen was the first female chairperson of the United Fresh Produce Association, a national trade organization representing the produce industry. Karen also served as the first female president of the Southern California-based Fresh Produce & Floral Council. She has been chairman and vice chairman of the USDA Fruit & Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee and a board member of the Federal Reserve Bank, Los Angeles chapter. Karen currently serves on the board of Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County.
Karen is also an innovative visionary. Her insights on the produce industry, leadership, and food trends are featured in publications such as AndNowUKnow.com and the Shelby Report. She is a frequent keynote speaker and panelist, including appearances at Bitten LA, THRIVE AgTech, and the Produce Marketing Association Fresh Summit. Her accomplishments have earned her industry recognitions such as the 2015 Women in Produce honoree and the 2016 Jim Hicks Agricultural Achievement Award from CSU-Cal Poly Pomona.
Beyond the industry, Karen serves as a role model for women entrepreneurs, as well as small and family-owned businesses. She has addressed the Los Angeles/Long Beach area of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business program and was the keynote speaker at the University of La Verne CEO Summit and the Las Vegas Food Expo. Karen is a frequent guest speaker at local universities.

WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.
