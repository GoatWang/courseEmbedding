Kevin's Lavender Farm


Company DescriptionKevin&＃039;s Lavender Farm is a Cleveland, Ohio based urban farm. The goal is to develop the former Memphis Elementary School site into Old Brooklyn&＃039;s first urban farm. The urban farm would grow the perennial floKevin's Lavender Farmr lavender. Currently the land envisioned for this urban farm is a vacant piece of property where the Memphis Elementary School was located until 2007 when the school was demolished- 2.4 acres. Lavender will be cultivated by planting 7, 000 lavender 2.5 inch potted plants and a crop can yield returns for 10 or 15 years. Over the course of the first year they will be tended and with the proper growing conditions harvesting is possible in the early summer of the following year. To aide the lavender into maximum flower production an apiary will be located on-site which will also prove beneficial by helping to pollinate the neighboring gardens.
