Ethics

CGG defines its ethical standards, core values and commitments in its Group Values, Code of Ethics, Business Code of Conduct and in the policies that guide their implementation. CGG’s Ethics Committee supports and oversees implementation of the Business Code of Conduct.
Code of Ethics: a commitment to Clients, Shareholders, Employees and Partners
The development of the CGG Group is constructed on the foundation of its values and ethics. This represents a commitment by CGG to its clients, its shareholders, its employees and its partners to comply with laws and regulations and to respect the principles of its Business Code of Conduct.

We contribute individually and collectively to the continued improvement of the health, safety and security of our working environment
We respect environmental standards and strive to minimize the impact of our activities
We protect the Group's assets and we fulfill our obligations concerning confidentiality
We avoid conflicts of interest, especially in our relationships with our clients, suppliers, competitors or partners
 We keep our commitments to them and we base our relationship on fair business practices
We comply in all circumstances with rules controlling insider trading
We do not receive or give gifts or invitations, which do not conform to good business ethics and we reject any form of corruption
We are attentive to the quality of human relations within our workplaces and we comply with regulations which seek to combat discrimination or harassment
We produce financial statements that reflect the company's situation fairly, and we communicate in a reliable, open and transparent way

Business Code of Conduct
The CGG Business Code of Conduct updates, revises and summarizes, in one universal framework, CGG standards for employee conduct, helping us to act consistently with our Group Mission and Vision & Values. It helps guide each of us as we work towards delivering our products and services with integrity. The code is a reference to important information all employees need to know – including where to get additional help.
CGG is a global company, and that means our employees are subject to the laws and regulations of different countries. The code establishes principles for business conduct applicable throughout the Group, regardless of location.

CGG (originally an acronym for Compagnie Générale de Géophysique) is a French-based geophysical services company founded in 1931.
CGG is a fully integrated[citation needed] Geoscience company providing leading[citation needed] geological, geophysical and reservoir capabilities to its broad base of customers[citation needed] primarily from the global oil and gas industry. Through its three complementary businesses of Equipment, Acquisition and Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR), CGG brings value[citation needed] across all aspects of natural resource exploration and exploitation.

History[edit]
CGG[edit]
In 1926, Conrad Schlumberger, and his brother Marcel Schlumberger, formed Société de Prospection Electrique (SPE) which specialized in oil and coal exploration as well as civil engineering.
In March 1931, SPE and Société Géophysique de Recherches Minières (SGRM), both specialists in seismology and magnetometry, merged into La Compagnie Générale de Géophysique. SGRM provided 5,000,000 francs of capital and CGG capital of 120,000 francs. In his premises at 30 rue Fabert, in Paris, Conrad Schlumberger decided to transfer the subsurface business to CGG while SPE retained the logging. At the same time, Raymond Maillet from SGRM was appointed President of CGG.
The first two years of business for CGG were shaky. Near-surface surveys (hydrology, mining and civil engineering) and oil exploration were not enough to break even in a period when oil was worth 10 cents a barrel. In 1966, CGG opened its first seismic data processing center in Massy, France.
Veritas DGC[edit]
Veritas Energy Services, a geophysical services company, was established in 1974 in Calgary, Canada with the purchase of Rafael B. Cruz and Associates Ltd. by David B. Robson.
Meanwhile, Digital Consultants Inc. had been established in Houston, Texas in 1965 with a vision to apply digital computing to the geophysical industry. In 1969, Digital Consultants reincorporated as Digicon Inc. (DGC), becoming a public company on the American Stock Exchange.
In 1996, Veritas DGC was formed from the merger of Veritas and Digicon.
Organization[edit]
Equipment[edit]
CGG’s Equipment business, Sercel, offers a full spectrum of systems, sensors and sources for seismic acquisition and downhole monitoring.[citation needed] Oilfield service companies and geophysical contractors use our[who?] equipment in the world’s most challenging environments, onshore, offshore, downhole and on the seabed.[citation needed]
Acquisition[edit]
CGG has the full range of data acquisition capabilities to conduct all types of geophysical surveys, large or small, onshore, offshore and in the air.[citation needed] We[who?] are unique[citation needed] in being able to provide seamless coverage with a wide portfolio of seismic and geophysical methods in any environment.[citation needed]
Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)[edit]
CGG offers innovative thinking[citation needed], region-specific expertise[citation needed] and game-changing technology[citation needed] to deliver high-impact integrated solutions across the E&P chain.[citation needed]
As a recognized pioneer in geophysics for over 80 years[citation needed], CGG remains at the forefront of advanced subsurface imaging[citation needed], to help clients overcome their increasingly complex challenges.[citation needed] CGG offers a full spectrum of consulting and software solutions for geology, geophysics and reservoir applications.[citation needed]
CGG also offers high-end seismic, gravity, magnetic, well, geologic and satellite multi-client data and studies in the world's most prospective regions.[citation needed]
The efficient and integrated management of geological, geophysical and reservoir data is key to successful and prompt decision-making.[citation needed] CGG brings together the full breadth of skill development programs to provide the E&P industry with comprehensive geoscience learning path programs.[citation needed] .

History[edit]
CGG[edit]
In 1926, Conrad Schlumberger, and his brother Marcel Schlumberger, formed Société de Prospection Electrique (SPE) which specialized in oil and coal exploration as well as civil engineering.
In March 1931, SPE and Société Géophysique de Recherches Minières (SGRM), both specialists in seismology and magnetometry, merged into La Compagnie Générale de Géophysique. SGRM provided 5,000,000 francs of capital and CGG capital of 120,000 francs. In his premises at 30 rue Fabert, in Paris, Conrad Schlumberger decided to transfer the subsurface business to CGG while SPE retained the logging. At the same time, Raymond Maillet from SGRM was appointed President of CGG.
The first two years of business for CGG were shaky. Near-surface surveys (hydrology, mining and civil engineering) and oil exploration were not enough to break even in a period when oil was worth 10 cents a barrel. In 1966, CGG opened its first seismic data processing center in Massy, France.
Veritas DGC[edit]
Veritas Energy Services, a geophysical services company, was established in 1974 in Calgary, Canada with the purchase of Rafael B. Cruz and Associates Ltd. by David B. Robson.
Meanwhile, Digital Consultants Inc. had been established in Houston, Texas in 1965 with a vision to apply digital computing to the geophysical industry. In 1969, Digital Consultants reincorporated as Digicon Inc. (DGC), becoming a public company on the American Stock Exchange.
In 1996, Veritas DGC was formed from the merger of Veritas and Digicon.
Organization[edit]
Equipment[edit]
CGG’s Equipment business, Sercel, offers a full spectrum of systems, sensors and sources for seismic acquisition and downhole monitoring.[citation needed] Oilfield service companies and geophysical contractors use our[who?] equipment in the world’s most challenging environments, onshore, offshore, downhole and on the seabed.[citation needed]
Acquisition[edit]
CGG has the full range of data acquisition capabilities to conduct all types of geophysical surveys, large or small, onshore, offshore and in the air.[citation needed] We[who?] are unique[citation needed] in being able to provide seamless coverage with a wide portfolio of seismic and geophysical methods in any environment.[citation needed]
Geology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)[edit]
CGG offers innovative thinking[citation needed], region-specific expertise[citation needed] and game-changing technology[citation needed] to deliver high-impact integrated solutions across the E&P chain.[citation needed]
As a recognized pioneer in geophysics for over 80 years[citation needed], CGG remains at the forefront of advanced subsurface imaging[citation needed], to help clients overcome their increasingly complex challenges.[citation needed] CGG offers a full spectrum of consulting and software solutions for geology, geophysics and reservoir applications.[citation needed]
CGG also offers high-end seismic, gravity, magnetic, well, geologic and satellite multi-client data and studies in the world's most prospective regions.[citation needed]
The efficient and integrated management of geological, geophysical and reservoir data is key to successful and prompt decision-making.[citation needed] CGG brings together the full breadth of skill development programs to provide the E&P industry with comprehensive geoscience learning path programs.[citation needed] .
