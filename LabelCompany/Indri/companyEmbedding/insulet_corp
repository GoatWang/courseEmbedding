WHY INSULIN?
Diabetes can change over time, and so may your treatment needs





WHY INSULIN?
Diabetes can change over time, and so may your treatment needs



































You may already be doing things that are helpful for controlling your blood sugar and lowering your A1C. See why you may also need to take insulin at some point to keep your blood sugar in your target range. If you have type 1 diabetes, insulin is already a part of your treatment.












What is insulin and how does it affect blood sugar?
















Insulin is a hormone made naturally in the pancreas that helps move sugar into the cells of your body. Your cells use the sugar as fuel to make energy.
Without enough insulin, sugar stays in your bloodstream, raising your blood sugar. High blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can lead to the signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as:

Feeling extreme thirst or hunger
Needing to go to the bathroom more often
Blurry vision

Over time, hyperglycemia can damage your nerves, eyesight, and kidneys, so it’s important to get your blood sugar in the target range recommended by your health care provider.
































Pancreas
An organ located behind the stomach that produces insulin and other hormones that regulate blood sugar levels and keep them from getting too high or too low.
A1C
A blood test that measures a person’s average blood sugar over the previous 2 to 3 months.    









                   
                    
                        
                        
                        Select a valid page path.
                    
                    
                        
                





















Different types of insulin are grouped by how long they work




















Type of insulin

Starts working in

Duration

Long-acting
1 hour
Up to 42 hours
Rapid-acting
10-30 minutes
Up to 5 hours
Premixeda
10-30 minutes
Up to 24 hours

















Long-acting (basal) insulin. Long-acting insulin works to control blood sugar between meals and when you sleep. Long-acting insulin is taken once or twice daily (often with your evening meal or at bedtime) to help give you around-the-clock blood sugar control. This is likely the first type of insulin your health care provider will prescribe for you if you have type 2 diabetes.
Rapid or fast-acting (bolus) insulin. Fast-acting insulin is taken near mealtime. This insulin works quickly to control the rapid spike in blood sugar after meals. Fast-acting insulin imitates the body’s natural release of insulin at mealtime.
Premixed insulin.a Premixed insulin combines the action of fast-acting and long-acting insulin. For example, a 70/30 mix means 70% has an extended action for between meals, and 30% acts fast for mealtime coverage.
aPremixed insulin combines specific proportions of a long-acting insulin with insulin that provides coverage for a meal in one vial or insulin pen. (The numbers following the brand name indicate the percentage of each type of action.)    

















Starting on insulin
















If you’re living with diabetes, you know how challenging it can be to reach your A1C and daily blood sugar goals. Even if you are eating well, being active, and taking your medication as prescribed, you may still not be at goal.






If you have type 2 diabetes, your doctor may suggest adding insulin to your diabetes treatment plan to help keep your blood sugar in your target range. Remember, diabetes can change over time and so can your treatment needs.

Insulet Corporation Issues Voluntary Recall of OmniPod® Insulin Management System
Contact:
  Consumer:
  1-855-407-3729
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – August 27, 2015  – Billerica, MA – On July 8, 2015, Insulet Corporation (Insulet or the Company) initiated a lot-specific voluntary recall of 40,846 boxes (10 Pods per box) of the OmniPod (Pod) Insulin Management System. This field corrective action is due to the possibility that some of the Pods from these lots may have a higher rate of failure than Insulet's current manufacturing standards. This recall does not affect the OmniPod Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). 
There are two ways in which these Pods can fail at a rate that is higher than Insulet's current standard. The cannula may either completely retract or fail to fully deploy, which may result in the patient not receiving the expected insulin dose. Or the Pod may trigger an audible alarm indicating it will no longer deliver insulin and will need to be replaced. Both situations can result in the interruption of insulin delivery that can cause hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can result in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 
The affected Pod lots have resulted in 90 Medical Device Reports of which 13 required medical intervention. No serious injuries or deaths have been reported in patients using OmniPod devices from the affected lots. 
Please check to determine if you have Pods from any of the lots listed below. The lot number is located on the Pod tray lid label and is also laser etched on the side of each individual Pod. The lot number is also located on the box of OmniPods. Consumers who have Pods from the affected lots should stop using them and return the pods for replacement.
The following OmniPod lots have been voluntarily recalled:

Announcement




On November 2, 2015, Insulet Corporation (Insulet or the Company) initiated a lot-specific voluntary Field Safety Notification (Notification) for 15 lots of the OmniPod (Pod) which were distributed in the U.S. and three lots which were distributed internationally.
Insulet has notified its distributors and customers by email, FedEx, and phone calls beginning on November 2, 2015, as well as all applicable regulatory agencies, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Consumers with questions may contact Insulet Customer Care via telephone at 1-855-407-3729 at any time.
This Notification is due to a slight increase in the reported cases in which the Pod’s needle mechanism failed to deploy or there was a delay in the deployment of the needle mechanism. The reported incidence of this product issue in the affected lots is approximately 1%-2%. Once this issue was recognized, the Company corrected the manufacturing process and implemented additional inspection steps.
This Notification does not affect the OmniPod Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM).
In the event a needle mechanism fails to deploy, the needle will not be inserted and insulin delivery will not begin. The interruption of insulin delivery may cause elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), which, if left untreated, can result in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). If a patient has activated a Pod and experiences unexpected elevated blood glucose levels, a healthcare professional should be consulted.
The affected Pod lots have resulted in 66 Medical Device Reports, of which three required medical intervention. No serious injuries or deaths have been reported in patients using OmniPod devices from the affected lots.
Consumers who have Pods from the affected lots should ensure the needle mechanism has deployed properly, and may contact Insulet Customer Care via telephone at 1-855-407-3729 at any time.
OmniPods from the affected lots listed below were distributed to customers in September 2015:

URGENT: Field Safety Notification
OmniPod® Insulin Management System
Certain OmniPod Lots Specified Below
 
Dear Valued Insulet Customer,

Insulet Corporation, the manufacturer of the OmniPod Insulin Delivery System, is committed to keeping you and your healthcare professionals up-to-date in the event there are any issues that arise related to our products.

As part of our product quality monitoring process, we have identified that 15 lots of OmniPod which were distributed in the U.S. had a slight increase in the reported cases in which the Pod’s needle mechanism failed to deploy or there was a delay in the deployment of the needle mechanism. The reported incidence of this product issue in the affected lots is approximately 1%-2%.  Once we recognized this, we corrected the manufacturing process and implemented additional inspection steps.

No serious injuries or deaths have been reported in patients using OmniPod devices from the affected lots.

How do I know if I have affected product? 
This Field Safety Notification affects only the Pods and does not affect the OmniPod Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM). The slight increase was identified in the following lots of Pods:





U.S. Lot Numbers


L41880
L41898
L41903


L41881
L41899
L41904


L41892
L41900
L41905


L41895
L41901
L41906


L41897
L41902
L41907




The lot number is located on the Pod tray lid label, the side of the Pod and on the end of the box of Pods.  

What is the risk? 
In the event a needle mechanism fails to deploy, the needle will not be inserted and insulin delivery will not begin. The interruption of insulin delivery may cause elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), which, if left untreated, can result in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). If you believe you have successfully activated your Pod and you experience unexpected elevated blood glucose levels, please consult your healthcare professional.

Upon activation, how do I know if the needle mechanism deployed? 
After you press the Start button on the PDM, you should hear a few soft clicks and then a louder click from the Pod indicating that the needle mechanism has deployed. If you do not hear this within a few seconds after pressing Start, the Pod has failed to deploy. 

You should also feel the insertion of the needle mechanism deployment. The PDM will indicate that the Pod is active and prompt you to check to ensure the cannula is properly inserted (Figure 5-23 below).  For more information, please see the User Guide.

You should always check the infusion site after insertion to ensure that the cannula was properly inserted. 


When you see the pink slide insert in this position, it means that the cannula is inserted (See figure below).

The PDM will automatically remind you to check your blood glucose 1.5 hours after each Pod change.  If the cannula is not properly inserted, hyperglycemia may result.

If you experience unexpected elevated blood glucose levels, change your Pod and contact your healthcare provider.You may also call Customer Care at 1-855-407-3729 if you have any questions regarding this Field Safety Notification. 

This voluntary action is being taken by Insulet Corporation with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this product may be reported to the FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online or by regular mail or by fax.
 
We appreciate how you depend on us and sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause you. We are focused on delivering the highest level of product quality and your complete satisfaction is our top priority.

Sincerely,

Michael Spears
Vice President, Quality, Regulatory & Clinical Affairs
Insulet Corporation

WHY INSULIN?
Diabetes can change over time, and so may your treatment needs





WHY INSULIN?
Diabetes can change over time, and so may your treatment needs



































You may already be doing things that are helpful for controlling your blood sugar and lowering your A1C. See why you may also need to take insulin at some point to keep your blood sugar in your target range. If you have type 1 diabetes, insulin is already a part of your treatment.












What is insulin and how does it affect blood sugar?
















Insulin is a hormone made naturally in the pancreas that helps move sugar into the cells of your body. Your cells use the sugar as fuel to make energy.
Without enough insulin, sugar stays in your bloodstream, raising your blood sugar. High blood sugar, or hyperglycemia, can lead to the signs and symptoms of diabetes, such as:

Feeling extreme thirst or hunger
Needing to go to the bathroom more often
Blurry vision

Over time, hyperglycemia can damage your nerves, eyesight, and kidneys, so it’s important to get your blood sugar in the target range recommended by your health care provider.
































Pancreas
An organ located behind the stomach that produces insulin and other hormones that regulate blood sugar levels and keep them from getting too high or too low.
A1C
A blood test that measures a person’s average blood sugar over the previous 2 to 3 months.    









                   
                    
                        
                        
                        Select a valid page path.
                    
                    
                        
                





















Different types of insulin are grouped by how long they work




















Type of insulin

Starts working in

Duration

Long-acting
1 hour
Up to 42 hours
Rapid-acting
10-30 minutes
Up to 5 hours
Premixeda
10-30 minutes
Up to 24 hours

















Long-acting (basal) insulin. Long-acting insulin works to control blood sugar between meals and when you sleep. Long-acting insulin is taken once or twice daily (often with your evening meal or at bedtime) to help give you around-the-clock blood sugar control. This is likely the first type of insulin your health care provider will prescribe for you if you have type 2 diabetes.
Rapid or fast-acting (bolus) insulin. Fast-acting insulin is taken near mealtime. This insulin works quickly to control the rapid spike in blood sugar after meals. Fast-acting insulin imitates the body’s natural release of insulin at mealtime.
Premixed insulin.a Premixed insulin combines the action of fast-acting and long-acting insulin. For example, a 70/30 mix means 70% has an extended action for between meals, and 30% acts fast for mealtime coverage.
aPremixed insulin combines specific proportions of a long-acting insulin with insulin that provides coverage for a meal in one vial or insulin pen. (The numbers following the brand name indicate the percentage of each type of action.)    

















Starting on insulin
















If you’re living with diabetes, you know how challenging it can be to reach your A1C and daily blood sugar goals. Even if you are eating well, being active, and taking your medication as prescribed, you may still not be at goal.






If you have type 2 diabetes, your doctor may suggest adding insulin to your diabetes treatment plan to help keep your blood sugar in your target range. Remember, diabetes can change over time and so can your treatment needs.

Read the Instructions for Use and take Tresiba® exactly as your health care provider tells you to
