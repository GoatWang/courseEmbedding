Level 3 Financing Commences Exchange Offer


Jun 20, 2005

Download this Press Release ()

Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: LVLT) today announced that Level 3 Financing, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has commenced an offer to exchange all of its currently outstanding 10.75% Senior Notes due 2011 that were privately placed in October 2003 with a new issue of 10.75% Senior Notes due 2011 that has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both the original notes and the new notes to be issued in the exchange offer are guaranteed by each of Level 3 Communications, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Level 3 Communications, LLC.
The exchange offer is required under the terms of the initial security. It will expire on July 20, 2005, at 5 p.m. EDT unless extended by the company. No additional proceeds will be raised in connection with this exchange offer.
About Level 3 Communications
Level 3 (NASDAQ: LVLT) is an international communications and information services company. The company operates one of the largest Internet backbones in the world, is one of the largest providers of wholesale dial-up service to ISPs in North America and is the primary provider of Internet connectivity for millions of broadband subscribers, through its cable and DSL partners. The company offers a wide range of communications services over its 23,000-mile broadband fiber optic network including Internet Protocol (IP) services, broadband transport and infrastructure services, colocation services, and patented softswitch managed modem and voice services. Its Web address is www.Level3.com.
The company offers information services through its subsidiaries, Software Spectrum and (i)Structure. For additional information, visit their respective Web sites at www.softwarespectrum.com and www.i-structure.com.
The Level 3 logo is a registered service mark of Level 3 Communications, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries. Level 3 services are offered by wholly owned subsidiaries of Level 3 Communications, Inc.
Forward-Looking Statement
Some of the statements made by Level 3 in this press release are forward- looking in nature. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Level 3 believes that its primary risk factors include, but are not limited to: developing new products and services that meet customer demands and generate acceptable margins; increasing the volume of traffic on Level 3's network; overcoming the softness in the economy given its disproportionate effect on the telecommunications industry; integrating strategic acquisitions; attracting and retaining qualified management and other personnel; successfully completing commercial testing of new technology and information systems to support new products and services, including voice transmission services; ability to meet all of the terms and conditions of our debt obligations; overcoming Software Spectrum's reliance on financial incentives, volume discounts and marketing funds from software publishers; reducing downward pressure of Software Spectrum's margins as a result of the use of volume licensing and maintenance agreements; and reducing rate of price compression on certain of the Company's existing transport and IP services. Additional information concerning these and other important factors can be found within Level 3's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in this release should be evaluated in light of these important factors.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The net proceeds of the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan were used to pre-pay Level 3 Financing’s $815,000,000 Tranche B-III 2019 Term Loan, $1,795,500,000 Tranche B 2020 Term Loan and $2,000,000,000 Tranche B-II 2022 Term Loan under the Existing Credit Agreement. As a result of the incurrence of the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan and the pre-payment of the Tranche B-III 2019 Term Loan, Tranche B 2020 Term Loan and Tranche B-II 2022 Term Loan, the total aggregate principal amount of the loans under the Restated Credit Agreement remains $4,610,500,000. The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan matures on February 22, 2024. The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan was priced to lenders at par, with the payment to the lenders of an upfront 25 basis point fee at closing. The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan has an interest rate, in the case of any ABR Borrowing (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement, as defined below), equal to (a) the greater of (i) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus ½ of 1% and (iii) the sum of (A) the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day (which LIBO Rate will in no event be less than 0%) plus (B) 1.0%, plus (b) 1.25% per annum.  In the case of any Eurodollar Borrowing (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement), the Tranche B 2024 Term Loan bears interest at the LIBO Rate for the interest period for such borrowing (which LIBO Rate will in no event be less than 0%) plus 2.25% per annum.

Level 3 Financing, Inc. Announces Complete Refinancing of $4.61 Billion Senior Secured Credit Agreement
Feb 21 17
Level 3 Financing, Inc. has successfully completed the marketing of the refinancing of all of its outstanding $4,610,500,000 senior secured term loans through the issuance of a new Tranche B 2024 Term Loan in the amount of $4,610,500,000.  The terms loans being refinanced are the Tranche B-III 2019 Term Loan, the Tranche B 2020 Term Loan and the Tranche B-II 2022 Term Loan. Upon closing, the new Tranche B 2024 Term Loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%, with a 0% minimum LIBOR, and will mature on February 22, 2024. The Tranche B 2024 Term Loan was priced to lenders at par, with the payment to the lenders at closing of an upfront 25 basis point fee. The company anticipates saving approximately $35 million of cash interest expense initially, on an annualized basis. As a result of this transaction, the company expects to account for the refinancing as an extinguishment of debt and recognize a non-cash loss of $45 million in the first quarter of 2017. The closing of the refinancing transaction is expected to be completed on February 22, 2017, subject to execution of definitive documentation and customary closing conditions.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis document, including the documents incorporated herein by reference, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, (i) statements about the benefits of the acquisition of tw telecom by Level 3, including financial and operating results and synergy benefits that may be realized from the acquisition and the timeframe for realizing those benefits; (ii) Level 3's and tw telecom's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; (iii) other statements contained in this communication that are not historical facts; and (iv) other statements identified by words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "goal," "strategy," "future," "likely," "may," "should," "could," "will," and words of similar meaning or similar references to future periods. 
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.  Instead, forward-looking statements are based only on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations regarding the future of our business, including the effects of the proposed acquisition of tw telecom by Level 3, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, risks, and contingencies, which may include third-party approvals, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, readers of this communication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. 
The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Level 3, tw telecom, Saturn Merger Sub 1 and Saturn Merger Sub 2 (the "Merger Agreement"); (2) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain the required stockholder approvals; (3) the inability to satisfy the other conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, including without limitation the receipt of necessary governmental or regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (4) the inability to successfully integrate our business with tw telecom's business or to integrate the businesses within the anticipated timeframe; (5) the risk that the proposed transactions disrupt current plans and operations, increase operating costs and the potential difficulties in customer loss and employee retention as a result of the announcement and consummation of such transactions; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the combination of Level 3 and tw telecom, including the realization of revenue and cost synergy benefits and to recognize such benefits within the anticipated timeframe; (7) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Level 3, tw telecom or others following announcement of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated therein; and (8) the possibility that Level 3 or tw telecom may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors.
Other important factors that may affect our business or the combined business' results of operations and financial condition include, but are not limited to: a discontinuation of the development and expansion of the Internet as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video; continued uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy; disruptions in the financial markets that could affect our ability to obtain additional financing; and our ability to: increase revenue from the services we offer; successfully use new technology and information systems to support new and existing services; prevent process and system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services that we provide; prevent our security measures from being breached, or our services from being degraded as a result of security breaches; develop new services that meet customer demands and generate acceptable margins; effectively manage expansions to our operations; provide services that do not infringe the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others; attract and retain qualified management and other personnel; and meet all of the terms and conditions of debt obligations.
