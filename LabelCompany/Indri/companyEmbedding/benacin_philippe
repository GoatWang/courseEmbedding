Companies & industry 
26 January 2010


 

Philippe Benacin, Inter Parfums: “2010, the post-crisis year” 
The companies Montblanc International GmbH and Inter ParfumsSA have signed a worldwide license agreement for the design, manufacture and distribution of fragrances and derived products under the brand name Montblanc. The contract with a duration of 10 years and a half will come into effect on July 1st, 2010. Montblanc fragrances are distributed in fifty countries worldwide.
Philippe Benacin, CEO of Inter Parfums reviews for Premium Beauty News the situation of his group in 2009 and outlines short and medium term prospects, also focusing on the launch in May, of a Burberry make-up line. Good news too: it’s the end of de-stocking!

Premium Beauty News - A few words about Inter Parfums and the economic environment of the latest months.  What is the outlook on 2010?
Philippe Benacin - Against all expectations, the year 2009 wasn’t that bad eventually. Remember that in 2008 our turnover exceeded 264 million Euros and that, in 2009, it will be on a trend of just over 252 million Euros. The drop is relatively limited, especially as our business in 2008 had profited from very positive opportunities in terms of launches. In addition, last year finally ended up on a very good trend.
In terms of strategy, the group is significantly strengthening its prospects with:
 creation of a new development strategy with the preparation of a complete line of make-up under the Burberry brand name. This line, the launch of which is planned during next summer, will facilitate a better visibility of perfumes at a retail level; diversification of the portfolio materialized next fall by the signature of a license agreement with the luxury brand Jimmy Choo.
As for this year, it promises to be full of new quality initiatives and should help our sales exceed 265 million Euros, an increase of over 9% in constant currency values compared to 2009, with in particular:
 a line of fragrances for women and men, Burberry Sport in February; a line of fragrances for women, Oriens by Van Cleef & Arpels in March; a Burberry make-up line in June; lines of women’s fragrances under the brand names Lanvin and ST Dupont in July; a line of men’s fragrances under the brand name Van Cleef & Arpels in September.




Philippe Benacin, CEO of Inter Parfums


Premium Beauty News - The crisis has not yet finished causing damage upstream of the sector, taking into account, among other factors, de-stocking policies which never seem to end.
Philippe Benacin - Well, good news concerning de-stocking policies, they are over! Our stock levels are extremely low and the year 2010 will be totally different. We will be ordering again!
Premium Beauty News - What about this license agreement with Montblanc?
Philippe Benacin - With leading positions in writing instruments, watches and leather goods, a promising development in women’s jewelry, an active presence in more than 70 countries, a network of 350 owned stores and high requirements on quality design and products, Montblanc has a potential for growth in fragrances and derived products. This partnership with a hundred-year old luxury brand acknowledged worldwide, reinforces the development prospects of our group in the segment of selective perfumery.
Premium Beauty News - This is undoubtedly one of the peculiarities of your group, total subcontracting, industrially speaking. What do you think is the balance to find between subcontracting in Europe, and more particularly in France, and Asia?
Philippe Benacin - Quite true! And by the way, the induced jobs represent, in my opinion, at least 600 people. As for the breakdown, it is clear that the filling is a 100% achieved in France, the purchase of components is done mostly in Europe (70% to 75%), not much in the United States and finally, very little in Asia (except for zamac).
This is largely due to the fact that our business is essentially focused on the perfume segment. A configuration which changes of course a little with Burberry’s new activity in make-up, especially concerning packaging where Asia has clearly taken a strong position. But remember that Italy remains a major player in the area of cosmetic ingredients.
Premium Beauty News - Will your arrival in the make-up segment also extend to other brands you own?
Philippe Benacin - In principle, no! This is justified with Burberry considering what the turnover of this brand accounts for within Inter Parfums (EUR 160 million). Remember that our second brand has a turnover of 40 million Euros. But I would like to underline that, on a marketing point of view, make-up is definitely a powerhouse for a brand. A drive that must not be neglected.

Philippe Benacin on Interparfums' past and future 
14-Jan-2014
Cosmetics Business News | Europe | Finance | Fragrance 

The Director, President and CEO talks about recent endings and new beginnings 

 

Last year was one of both endings and new beginnings for Interparfums. The French fragrance group officially bid goodbye to its licence agreement with Burberry in March before launching the much anticipated debut scent for French dance wear maker Repetto in June. In the meantime, it managed to post solid financials: the company saw net sales (excluding Burberry) climb 45% in Q3 2013 compared to the previous year. Director, President and CEO Philippe Benacin talks to Cosmetics International about the company's past and future.
Asia is currently known as a booming market for luxury brands. Do you agree?
I totally agree. For Interparfums, however, we started in China and the Far East territories back in the late eighties and early nineties. So for us, this is not new. We've been strong in Asia for some time and it's a reputation that has been built over the last 25 years.
What approach do you take to targeting the Asian consumer?
There's no recipe for success � it's about taking a specific and targeted approach for each and every market you're in. It's all about finding the right mixture between brands, products and your marketing approach.

Within our portoflio, Montblanc and Balmain are both strong in Asia as the fashion brands are also popular. Lanvin and Jimmy Choo are not strong yet but they have potential.

Job Details
               In 2015, Vivendi renewed its listing on the main SRI (Socially Responsible Investments) indices: the FTSE4GoodGlobal and FTSE4Good Europe (FTSE), the Global and Europe Ethibel Excellence (Ethibel) investment register, the Thomson Reuters CRI Europe ESG Index (Thomson Reuters), the EuroNext Vigeo Eurozone 120 and Europe 120 (Vigeo), and several indices established by Stoxx. In the Global 100, Vivendi ranks number eleven among the French companies, and is the only French media company in the ranking (January 2016). Out of 4,353 global variables, the Global 100 identifies the 100 companies with a "best in class" CSR approach and strong financial performance. Vivendi was also ranked second among the European companies in the media sector by the extra -financial rating agency Vigeo (January 2015). In 2013, Vivendi was positioned third in the latest ranking of the companies in the CAC 40 in relation to taking into account the "Children's Rights and Business Principles", established in 2012 by UNICEF, the United Nations Global Compact and the Save the Children NGO . The Group also responds each year to the Carbon Disclosure Project(CDP - an international organization that publishes an annual report on the integration of climate change in the strategies of the world's 50 largest companies). Vivendi's CSR approach was applauded by the Worldwide Movement for Human Rights (FIDH), which, in November 2014, added Vivendi to its Libertés et Solidarité socially responsible investment fund (Sicav), a fund managed by Banque Postale Asset Management since 2001. In particular, FIDH recognized "the innovative efforts undertaken by Vivendi to understand, measure and improve its impact on human rights. FIDH noted that "establishing and reporting on indicators measuring the impact on human rights of the content distributed by Vivendi is especially innovative. FIDH also encourages Vivendi to continue its efforts and to pursue its policy in relation to dialog. Pascale Thumerelle, Vivendi's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Vice President, has been selected for theGlobal Diversity List. First established by The Economist in 2015, this list recognizes figures from the public and private sectors and professional networks that have distinguished themselves worldwide through their commitment to and efforts on behalf of diversity.
