Interest Free, Islamic home partnership program | Guidance Residential

Menu

Declining Balance Co-ownership Program
Guidance Residential is the #1 U.S. provider of Shariah-compliant home financing. Our Declining Balance Co-ownership Program is modeled on the Islamic concept of ‘Musharakah Mutanaqisa’ or diminishing partnership. The program has been certified by an independent Shariah Supervisory Board, which performs an annual audit to ensure absolute compliance with Shariah.
		  In this model, Guidance Residential and the homebuyer engage in a joint ownership venture where each owns a percentage of the home equal to the equity they each contributed. Homebuyers are required to make monthly payments to Guidance Residential over a predetermined period of time in order to completely buy out Guidance Residential’s equity, and own the property outright. The monthly payment consists of two portions; an amount that is allocated for acquisition of Guidance Residential’s equity and the other allocated as rent for use of the portion of the home they do not yet own. The acquisition amount helps in buying Guidance Residential’s shares of ownership over the predetermined period of time and the rent is the profit Guidance Residential earns from this co-ownership program.

Unique benefits of the program
Guidance Residential offers 6 unique benefits that distinguish it from other home financing providers. These benefits provide a transparent, consumer friendly home financing and is consistent with the Muslim faith’s strict prohibition on riba (usury).








Co-ownership
Guidance Residential and home buyers each own a percentage as co-owners. Home buyers increase their share over a period of time through a monthly payment.





Risk sharing
Guidance Residential shares the risk with the home buyer in case of natural disasters, eminent domain or foreclosure.







Riba-free
The Declining Balance Co-ownership Program, does not involve payment of interest. It is 100% riba-free.





No pre-payment penalty
There is no pre-payment penalty required by Guidance Residential when a home buyer wants to pay ahead of the agreed schedule.







Capped late payment fees
In case of late payments, Guidance Residential charges only a capped fee equaling $50 or less, exclusively meant to cover the expenses involved in administering a late payment, rather than the standard 5% penalty.





Non-recourse commitment
In the event of payment default, Guidance Residential does not pursue any of the home buyer’s other assets.










The Guidance Residential Difference
A comparison of Musharaka or  Declining Balance Co-ownership Program to a conventional mortgage.






Shariah-Compliant
(Declining Balance Co-ownership Program)


Conventional Mortgages





The home buyer and Guidance Residential agree to be co-owners in the property.

1





The home buyer arranges a loan from a bank or mortgage company according to a fixed or floating interest rate.





The two parties buy the home and the ownership of the property is determined by each party’s down payment.

2





The home buyer purchases the home.





The home buyer makes monthly payments to Guidance Residential. Part of the payment is a utility fee for full use of the home and the rest is a payment to increase the buyer's ownership in the property.

3





The home buyer makes monthly payments to repay principal and interest on the loan.





Over the course of the arrangement, the home buyer purchases all of Guidance Residential’s ownership stake and becomes the sole owner of the property.

4





Over the course of the loan, the home buyer repays the debt in full.

Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust (Ticker symbols: AMANX, AMAGX, and AMDWX), headquartered in Bellingham, Washington, is a mutual fund company offering investment products consistent with Islamic banking principles.[1][2]

Founding principles[edit]
The Amana Income Fund, founded by Unified Management Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, in 1986, was the Trust’s first fund. The Amana Growth Fund was created in 1994. The Amana Developing World Fund was created in 2009. All three funds are managed according to Islamic principles.
Traditional mutual funds are off-limits to Muslims, because they typically contain securities that are forbidden by sharia law. Accordingly, the Amana Funds are managed under strict guidelines to comply with Islamic principles. Examples of forbidden (haram) investments are companies that:



Produce or sell alcohol, tobacco or pornography
Process or sell pork products
Generate revenue from gambling or interest (riba)
Maintain a debt ratio of greater than one-third of assets[1]



The funds were created and are still managed under the value investment style. Nicholas Kaiser has been portfolio manager of the funds since 1990. Scott Klimo is the deputy portfolio manager of the funds.[2]
The Amana Funds are unique in that they were specifically conceived to meet the needs of Muslim investors. One of the reasons Muslims are motivated to save and invest is to make financial preparations necessary to make the Hajj, a sacred form of a self-presentation before God (Allah in Arabic) that is considered within Islam to be one of life's primary duties. In order to make the Hajj, a Muslim must first get his financial house in order, which presents special challenges if the money is to be invested in compliance Shari'ah-oriented financial principles. According to Amana's founding chairman Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza,

In order to make the Hajj, muslims must first pay off their debts, including the zakat due on their wealth; to return whatever was given them in trust; and have enough savings to bear the expenses of the journey (such as travel, Hajj tax, and lodging) and the sacrifice (of an animal). Besides this, they also have to provide for their families and dependents during their absence. They must have earned and saved enough to cover these expenses. No Hajj is valid if it is performed "on credit."[3]

Performance[edit]
Performance of the Amana Funds is best evaluated by consulting a variety of sources. The ticker symbols for the funds are:

The Amana Income Fund: AMANX (Inception: June 23, 1986)

The Amana Developing World Fund: AMDWX (Inception: Sept. 28, 2009)

Founding principles[edit]
The Amana Income Fund, founded by Unified Management Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, in 1986, was the Trust’s first fund. The Amana Growth Fund was created in 1994. The Amana Developing World Fund was created in 2009. All three funds are managed according to Islamic principles.
Traditional mutual funds are off-limits to Muslims, because they typically contain securities that are forbidden by sharia law. Accordingly, the Amana Funds are managed under strict guidelines to comply with Islamic principles. Examples of forbidden (haram) investments are companies that:



Produce or sell alcohol, tobacco or pornography
Process or sell pork products
Generate revenue from gambling or interest (riba)
Maintain a debt ratio of greater than one-third of assets[1]



The funds were created and are still managed under the value investment style. Nicholas Kaiser has been portfolio manager of the funds since 1990. Scott Klimo is the deputy portfolio manager of the funds.[2]
The Amana Funds are unique in that they were specifically conceived to meet the needs of Muslim investors. One of the reasons Muslims are motivated to save and invest is to make financial preparations necessary to make the Hajj, a sacred form of a self-presentation before God (Allah in Arabic) that is considered within Islam to be one of life's primary duties. In order to make the Hajj, a Muslim must first get his financial house in order, which presents special challenges if the money is to be invested in compliance Shari'ah-oriented financial principles. According to Amana's founding chairman Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza,

In order to make the Hajj, muslims must first pay off their debts, including the zakat due on their wealth; to return whatever was given them in trust; and have enough savings to bear the expenses of the journey (such as travel, Hajj tax, and lodging) and the sacrifice (of an animal). Besides this, they also have to provide for their families and dependents during their absence. They must have earned and saved enough to cover these expenses. No Hajj is valid if it is performed "on credit."[3]

Performance[edit]
Performance of the Amana Funds is best evaluated by consulting a variety of sources. The ticker symbols for the funds are:

The Amana Income Fund: AMANX (Inception: June 23, 1986)
The Amana Growth Fund: AMAGX (Inception: Feb. 3, 1994)
The Amana Developing World Fund: AMDWX (Inception: Sept. 28, 2009)

Organization and structure[edit]
Saturna Capital Corporation is the investment adviser and administrator of the Amana Mutual Funds Trust and the Saturna Investment Trust. Saturna Capital Corporation, established in 1989, is administrator to $3.8 billion in assets under management as of September 2012.[4]
Saturna Sdn. Bhd., located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Saturna Capital Corporation.[5]

Following Principles of Islamic Finance




 











Halal Investing
 










Halal investing requires investment decisions to be made in accordance with Islamic principles. As a faith-based approach to investment management, investors often consider Halal investing to be a category of ethical or socially responsible investing.
Islamic principles require that investors share in profit and loss, that they receive no interest (riba), and that they do not invest in a business that is prohibited by Islamic law, or sharia. Before investing in a company, it is necessary to evaluate its business activities and financial records to determine where its primary revenue comes from and how its income and expenditures are managed. A company that meets certain criteria would be Halal, or permissible. If it does not meet the criteria, it would be haram, or not permitted.
Interpretation of Islamic law as applied to business activities is nuanced, and halal investment guidelines can vary. Therefore, Muslim investors often rely on guidance from Islamic scholars to help determine whether an investment is Halal.
Investments that sharia scholars universally consider unacceptable are companies whose primary business activities violate the core tenets of Islam, including the manufacture or marketing of alcohol; gambling or gaming activities; conventional interest-based financial services; pork and pork products; and pornography. In addition, most sharia scholars advise against investing in tobacco companies.
Islamic scholars have established financial guidelines to determine when a business activity is a core source of revenue and when it is not. For example, the five percent rule says that a core business activity is one that accounts for more than five percent of a company's revenue, or gross income. This reasoning applies to the Islamic prohibition on riba, or interest, as well. If a company's interest-based income or holdings exceed certain limits, then investing in the company is forbidden.
Often, it is not possible to avoid haram business activities. Islamic law requires "purification" of investment earnings that can be attributed to haram activities. One way to do this is through zakah, a form of charitable giving that can help you cleanse impure investment income by giving it away to acceptable charitable causes. For more information on zakah, and how Saturna Capital can help, please refer to our Zakah page.
Halal Investment Screening
Halal investment screens help assess whether a company's business activities are Halal or haram. The screens facilitate the elimination of haram investments from consideration.
Halal investing screens seek to eliminate
bonds and other interest-based investments
stocks of companies that have high debt (sometimes referred to as highly leveraged)
securities of companies in industries that do not adhere to Islamic principles, such as liquor, gambling, pornography, pork, insurance, banks, etc.
mutual funds or hedge funds that trade securities frequently (have high turnover rates) because frequent trading is seen as gambling by some Islamic scholars
Saturna Capital, adviser to the Amana Funds, employs proprietary screens and an investment process developed in collaboration with Islamic scholars of the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA), a non-profit organization serving the Muslim community. In addition to the business sector screens listed above, Saturna Capital applies the following financial screens, seeking to eliminate companies with
greater than five percent of their revenue coming from haram sources
greater than 33 percent total debt as compared to their market capitalization (trailing 12 month average)
greater than 45 percent accounts receivable as compared to their total assets (trailing 12 month average)
If a company fails the screening process it is considered an unacceptable investment. However, Halal investment screening is not always straightforward. When considering whether an investment is Halal, it is necessary to look deeply into a company's business activities to discover its core sources of revenue, or how it actually makes its money.
A company's industry sector, or part of the economy to which it belongs, may not always tell you the whole story. A computer software company may write programs used in gambling. A company that publishes children's books may also produce books that are considered pornographic. An agricultural producer might sell its crops exclusively to breweries. On the surface, each of these companies may not appear to be haram, but a closer examination reveals otherwise.
Saturna's investment analysts use NEPTUNE® software, developed in-house by Saturna, to screen, grade, and monitor more than 10,000 securities traded worldwide monthly. Securities that receive an "A" grade are subject to further in-depth review prior to purchase.
The Halal investment process does not end with a security's purchase. We monitor the securities in the Amana Funds' portfolios for ongoing compliance with Halal investing criteria and sell if they fail screens at a later date.
Benefits and Risks of Halal Investing
Investing according to Islamic principles can offer many benefits to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Halal investing encourages a disciplined investment process that promotes in-depth security research and monitoring. Generally, the low debt requirements of Islamic screens facilitate a conservative approach that appeals to risk-averse investors.
Halal investing discourages short-term speculation. The low turnover required in Halal investment portfolios results in longer planned holding periods and close scrutiny of company financials. Low turnover also minimizes portfolio trading expenses, such as broker commissions, while increasing tax efficiency by avoiding rapid buying and selling of securities that can generate taxable capital gains.
The limitations imposed on investment opportunities by Islamic principles potentially creates risk. For example, among the securities researched monthly by Saturna Capital for the Amana Funds, less than half pass the initial screens necessary to be considered Halal. Restricting investment choices to a smaller universe means that a Halal portfolio may not be as diversified as other portfolios, which may increase the risk of loss. The returns from various market sectors rise and fall at different times. Islamic principles may limit opportunities to gain when prohibited market sectors, such as financial services, rally.
Because Islamic principles preclude the use of interest-paying investments, Halal cash reserves cannot be invested in traditional money market funds or deposited in an interest-earning bank account and therefore do not earn income.
Halal Mutual Funds
In 1984, Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza suggested the idea to create the first US mutual fund managed according to Islamic principles, which became the Amana Income Fund. As an active member of a Muslim investing group, Mirza found it difficult and time-consuming to vet securities for his own Halal portfolios. He felt a professional investment advisory firm, with greater collective expertise and resources, would be better suited to carry out the complex Islamic screening process. He also felt a mutual fund would be the ideal Halal investment vehicle because its structure ensures that investors share in profit and loss.
Today, a variety of Halal investment products serve the needs of Muslim investors, including the original Amana Income Fund started in 1986, the Amana Growth Fund started in 1994, and the Amana Developing World Fundstarted in 2009.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.

Is The Amana Growth Fund The Perfect Mutual Fund? - Amana Mutual Funds Trust Growth Fund Inv (MUTF:AMAGX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is The Amana Growth Fund The Perfect Mutual Fund?Apr.20.17 | About: Amana Mutual (AMAGX) Mycroft Friedrich Research analyst, newsletter provider, contrarian, long-term horizonMarketplaceFriedrich Global ResearchSummaryPerforms a quantitative analysis of the "Amana Growth Fund" using some unique free cash flow ratios.Compares the results to the S&P 500 Index and the PowerShares QQQ ETF.Allows one to practice "capital appreciation through capital preservation." Recently, I wrote an article on Seeking Alpha called "How To Value Your Portfolio On Main Street Vs. Wall Street" that explains how our Friedrich algorithm can take any list of stocks, indices, or specific portfolios and analyze each on Main Street and Wall Street, using some unique free cash flow ratios. Friedrich is the name given to our algorithm for analyzing companies that trade on the global stock markets. In creating Friedrich, we concentrated on analyzing each company's Main Street operations and compared those results to Wall Street's own valuation, as measured by market price. Through our Friedrich algorithm, we can analyze 10 years of balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement data for each company, all at once, and generate one final result in minutes. Friedrich was designed to be ultra conservative, and thus, will cut zero slack to any company under analysis and will do so with zero emotion. In this article, we will be analyzing the Amana Growth Fund (MUTF:AMAGX) and compare its results to those of the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) and the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ). Here is the link to the Fund Manager. The following is a performance chart of the Amana Growth Fund versus the PowerShares QQQ ETF and the S&P 500 Index: 

 From a Wall Street performance point of view, the Amana Growth Fund has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the Powershares QQQ ETF since 2000, almost doubling the performance of the S&P 500 Index and more than doubling that of the Powershares QQQ ETF. Now if we look at the following below you will see that what the Amana Growth Fund has achieved is very rare as only about 21.8% of mutual funds have been able to beat the S&P 500 index over the last 20 years, thus the Amana Growth Fund is in a very select group. 

 As an investor, it is very important to continuously analyze one's holdings by measuring your portfolio's Main Street performance versus its Wall Street valuation. Whether you are a portfolio manager in charge of $1 billion in assets or a small investor with a $10,000 portfolio, the concept is always the same. You, as an investor, should always know where your portfolio stands at all times, and thus, not be swayed by groupthink. By doing so, you are always practicing "Capital Appreciation through Capital Preservation." Well, how does one go about doing so? Before I present our final results for the Amana Growth Fund versus the S&P 500 Index and the PowerShares QQQ ETF, let us first explain how we compare Main Street performance to Wall Street valuation. We will do so by using our Friedrich Global Research System. The Main Street ratio we use in our analysis is called FROIC, which can be defined as: Main Street Analysis = FROIC FROIC means "Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital" Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)] * When doing our free cash flow calculation, please note that because Capital Spending is recorded in the cash flow statement as a negative result, and we therefore must add it, in order to subtract it properly. FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-term Debt + Shareholders' Equity) What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow, it therefore has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (67 in total) we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, this news will eventually show up on Wall Street's radar. For our Wall Street Analysis, we use our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio. Wall Street Analysis = Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett entitled "Owner Earnings," or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of "Free Cash Flow." To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explains how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term "owner earnings" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations. (Owner earnings) represent (A) reported earnings plus (B) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges... less (C) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. I have used this free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line's sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009. In the backtest I mentioned above, I demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 times or less its price-to-free cash flow ratio, the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. I have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio in honor of both men. The following is how each ratio below is calculated: Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share) Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital Long-term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding) Sherlock Debt Divisor. A major concern that I have these days in analyzing companies is the amount of debt each takes on relative to its operations, and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt also can be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So what I have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor. What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and reward those that successfully use debt as leverage. How do I do this? Well, I take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt, I reward it, and punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this result is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used, and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment. Thus, having successfully defined the Sherlock Debt Divisor, I thought I would give an example of how it works by analyzing the largest holding in the Amana Growth Fund, which is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In order to do that, we need the following bits of financial data in order to calculate it for Apple. TTM, for those who don't know, is "trailing 12 months," or as close to real time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. Market Price Per Share = $140.68 (at time of analysis) Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities Total Current Assets = $103,332,000,000 Total Current Liabilities = $84,130,000,000 Working Capital = $19,202,000,000 Long-term Debt = $73,557,000,000 Diluted Shares Outstanding = 5,328,000,000 Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)) Sherlock Debt Divisor = $140.68 - (($19,202,000,000 - $73,557,000,000)/5,328,000,000)) Sherlock Debt Divisor = $140.68 - (-$10.20) = $150.88 Since Apple has more long-term debt versus working capital, we therefore must punish it and use the new $150.88 as our new numerator in all our calculations. Having calculated the Sherlock Debt Divisor for Apple, let us now proceed and do a Price-to-Bernhard Buffett analysis for the company. Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)] Sherlock Debt Divisor = $150.88 Net Income per diluted share = $45,217,000,000/5,328,000,000 = $8.49 Depreciation per diluted share = $10,538,000,000/5,328,000,000 = $1.98 Capital Spending per diluted share = -$12,456,000,000/5,328,000,000 = $-2.34 $8.49 + $1.98 + (-$2.34) = $8.13 Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $150.88/$8.13= 18.56 Now that we have taught everyone how to calculate our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio, let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio, using Apple again as our example. This is how we calculate it: FROIC means "Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital" Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)] FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-term Debt + Shareholders' Equity) Net Income per diluted share = $45,217,000,000/5,328,000,000 = $8.49 Depreciation per diluted share = $10,538,000,000/5,328,000,000 = $1.98 Capital Spending per diluted share = -$12,456,000,000/ 5,328,000,000 = $-2.34 Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 1% [(($8.49 + $1.98) (101%)) + ($-2.34) = $8.23 Long-term Debt = $73,557,000,000 Shareholders' Equity = $132,390,000,000 Diluted Shares Outstanding = 5,328,000,000 FROIC = [(Forward Free Cash Flow Per Diluted Share)/((Long-term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)] $8.23/$38.65 = 21% FROIC = 21% Now that we have defined the ratios to be used in our analysis and have showed everyone how to calculate each of them, here is a complete analysis of the individual components of the Amana Growth Fund: 

 When analyzing the Amana Growth Funds components we set up certain rules to use when analyzing any group of stocks, which you should also follow when analyzing one's own portfolio using our methodology: If a stock has a negative FROIC result, we automatically assign it a score of 100 for its Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio in order to keep everything consistent and logical, as you can't have a negative Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio when analyzing portfolios. Then, at the same time, the maximum FROIC allowed is 100%, so we can keep everything consistent and logical as well, as anything higher distorts the results for the group. We also give a zero result for FROIC for any "cash position" in the portfolio and a 22.50 result for the Price-to-Buffett Free Cash Flow, (which is 15 (buy) + 30 (sell) = 45/2 = 22.50). This was done to force one never to feel comfortable in cash, unless one has no choice in the matter, which is the case for us now. Our real-time research clearly shows that the markets are overvalued, as measured by our analysis of the following. The final results for the entire the Amana Growth Fund are: FROIC = 19.61% (Main Street) Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF = 26.87 (Wall Street) The final results for the entire S&P 500 Index are: FROIC = 12% (Main Street) Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF = 38.34 (Wall Street) The final results for the entire the PowerShares QQQ ETF are: FROIC = 14.59% (Main Street) Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF = 42.25 (Wall Street) For FROIC, we consider any result above 20% to be excellent and any result above 10% to be good, so when we round off the 19.61% FROIC for the Amana Growth Fund we get 20%, which is considered excellent and tells us (that as a group on Main Street) the holdings of the fund are doing great. The fund also generated a score of 26.87 for our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio. That ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, the fund is not yet overbought, but is sure getting close to being so. Nevertheless on Main Street the Amana Growth Fund has the highest FROIC score (Main Street performance) that we have ever seen for a fund or ETF, but having said that the word "perfect" can only be found in the dictionary and not in real life, so let us say it is the "best" fund so far. The fund's holdings are great, but most are overbought and that is because the U.S. markets are overbought as well. So the rising tides just keep rising and are lifting all boats in the process. Our model portfolios, which are available to our premium subscribers here on Seeking Alpha's Marketplace, use cash as a way to hedge against market overvaluation and our conservative portfolio has a 44% FROIC currently, while our more aggressive one has a FROIC of 34%. Thus, our subscribers don't need to invest in Funds or ETF's as our Friedrich Algorithm generates elite model portfolios that are filled with Main Street Super Stars. We also bought most of them at attractive Price to Bernhard Buffet (Wall Street Valuations). As we enter more countries, we will eventually launch our global portfolio very soon, picking stocks from 27 countries for those of you who want to go international. Going forward, Our Friedrich Algorithm's results show that it might be safer to invest in Apple Inc. rather than the Amana Growth Fund as Apple has a very strong track record of consistency as shown by our Friedrich Datafile and Friedrich Chart below: 

 

 In addition to our Friedrich algorithm, I rely on a tool that I found to be very useful in verifying our work. The Forensic Accounting Stock Tracker (FAST Model) helps identify companies that may be resorting to more financial tricks to make analyst estimates. The model helps pinpoint where management might be aggressive with revenue recognition, cash flows, and the balance sheet, and also takes into account valuation and other metrics. Here is the FAST Models results for Apple: 

 @DelvecchioJd In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comment section below, and don't forget to hit the "Follow" button next to our user name at the top of this article. Now that we are able to analyze indices, we will continue the process of analyzing ETFs, mutual funds, and certain popular portfolio managers' (gurus) portfolios in a series of articles here on Seeking Alpha. That effort will, of course, be in addition to providing analysis on individual stocks. Since most use the S&P 500 Index as the comparative benchmark, we can see how each is doing in a side-by-side comparison. Finally, in our premium product offering on Seeking Alpha's Marketplace, we also offer model portfolios for the conservative as well as the aggressive investor and have exclusive historic analysis on select companies going as far back as 1969. Wall Street has a ton of algorithms at its disposal that cost very high fees to access, but our product was priced for the individual investor who would like to have the advantage as well. Wall Street has its algorithms, but you can access ours and compete head to head with Wall Street's, as the only way Wall Street will get access to Friedrich data is to subscribe just like everyone else. So, whether you are an investment pro or an individual investor, the price is always the same for our product here on Seeking Alpha's Marketplace, so give us a try for two weeks free and enter the unique world of our Friedrich analysis.

Interest Free, Islamic home partnership program | Guidance Residential

Declining Balance Co-ownership Program
Guidance Residential is the #1 U.S. provider of Shariah-compliant home financing. Our Declining Balance Co-ownership Program is modeled on the Islamic concept of ‘Musharakah Mutanaqisa’ or diminishing partnership. The program has been certified by an independent Shariah Supervisory Board, which performs an annual audit to ensure absolute compliance with Shariah.
		  In this model, Guidance Residential and the homebuyer engage in a joint ownership venture where each owns a percentage of the home equal to the equity they each contributed. Homebuyers are required to make monthly payments to Guidance Residential over a predetermined period of time in order to completely buy out Guidance Residential’s equity, and own the property outright. The monthly payment consists of two portions; an amount that is allocated for acquisition of Guidance Residential’s equity and the other allocated as rent for use of the portion of the home they do not yet own. The acquisition amount helps in buying Guidance Residential’s shares of ownership over the predetermined period of time and the rent is the profit Guidance Residential earns from this co-ownership program.

Unique benefits of the program
Guidance Residential offers 6 unique benefits that distinguish it from other home financing providers. These benefits provide a transparent, consumer friendly home financing and is consistent with the Muslim faith’s strict prohibition on riba (usury).








Co-ownership
Guidance Residential and home buyers each own a percentage as co-owners. Home buyers increase their share over a period of time through a monthly payment.





Risk sharing
Guidance Residential shares the risk with the home buyer in case of natural disasters, eminent domain or foreclosure.







Riba-free
The Declining Balance Co-ownership Program, does not involve payment of interest. It is 100% riba-free.





No pre-payment penalty
There is no pre-payment penalty required by Guidance Residential when a home buyer wants to pay ahead of the agreed schedule.







Capped late payment fees
In case of late payments, Guidance Residential charges only a capped fee equaling $50 or less, exclusively meant to cover the expenses involved in administering a late payment, rather than the standard 5% penalty.





Non-recourse commitment
In the event of payment default, Guidance Residential does not pursue any of the home buyer’s other assets.










The Guidance Residential Difference
A comparison of Musharaka or  Declining Balance Co-ownership Program to a conventional mortgage.






Shariah-Compliant
(Declining Balance Co-ownership Program)


Conventional Mortgages





The home buyer and Guidance Residential agree to be co-owners in the property.

1





The home buyer arranges a loan from a bank or mortgage company according to a fixed or floating interest rate.





The two parties buy the home and the ownership of the property is determined by each party’s down payment.

Founding principles[edit]
The Amana Income Fund, founded by Unified Management Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, in 1986, was the Trust’s first fund. The Amana Growth Fund was created in 1994. The Amana Developing World Fund was created in 2009. All three funds are managed according to Islamic principles.
Traditional mutual funds are off-limits to Muslims, because they typically contain securities that are forbidden by sharia law. Accordingly, the Amana Funds are managed under strict guidelines to comply with Islamic principles. Examples of forbidden (haram) investments are companies that:



Produce or sell alcohol, tobacco or pornography
Process or sell pork products
Generate revenue from gambling or interest (riba)
Maintain a debt ratio of greater than one-third of assets[1]



The funds were created and are still managed under the value investment style. Nicholas Kaiser has been portfolio manager of the funds since 1990. Scott Klimo is the deputy portfolio manager of the funds.[2]
The Amana Funds are unique in that they were specifically conceived to meet the needs of Muslim investors. One of the reasons Muslims are motivated to save and invest is to make financial preparations necessary to make the Hajj, a sacred form of a self-presentation before God (Allah in Arabic) that is considered within Islam to be one of life's primary duties. In order to make the Hajj, a Muslim must first get his financial house in order, which presents special challenges if the money is to be invested in compliance Shari'ah-oriented financial principles. According to Amana's founding chairman Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza,

In order to make the Hajj, muslims must first pay off their debts, including the zakat due on their wealth; to return whatever was given them in trust; and have enough savings to bear the expenses of the journey (such as travel, Hajj tax, and lodging) and the sacrifice (of an animal). Besides this, they also have to provide for their families and dependents during their absence. They must have earned and saved enough to cover these expenses. No Hajj is valid if it is performed "on credit."[3]

Performance[edit]
Performance of the Amana Funds is best evaluated by consulting a variety of sources. The ticker symbols for the funds are:

The Amana Income Fund: AMANX (Inception: June 23, 1986)
The Amana Growth Fund: AMAGX (Inception: Feb. 3, 1994)
The Amana Developing World Fund: AMDWX (Inception: Sept. 28, 2009)

Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

History[edit]
The concept for the Amana Funds emerged in 1984 when two members of the North American Islamic Trust, Yaqub Mirza and Bassam Osman, presented the idea of a mutual fund for Muslim investors to Nicholas Kaiser, who was then portfolio manager of multiple mutual funds at Unified Management Corporation, based in Indianapolis, IN.[10][11]
Portfolio Managers[edit]
The Amana Funds' portfolios have been managed since 1989 by Nicholas Kaiser, MBA, CFA, (Chairman and controlling shareowner of the Amana Funds’ Adviser, Saturna Capital Corporation).
