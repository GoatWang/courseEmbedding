Cellect groundbreaking technology (ApoGraft™) turns production of stem cells  into a trivial, safe and inexpensive process




Be the first to know


Learn more










Regenerative medicine




It is all about replacing damaged tissues and organs instead of "fixing" them with drugs and radiations









Regrowth of organs and tissues is no longer a science fiction





Stem Cells are the building blocks....









... but they are extremely rare and difficult to cultivate




The process takes weeks in specialty labs, remains highly ineffective and its costs keep stem cells treatments in general as a privilege of the elitist-few who can afford it





Cellect changes all that.
Enables safe and effective stem cells cultivation within hours and
at fraction of the cost
- for all people.









Licensing ApoGraft™ Stem Cell sellection technology to:
Pharma companies
Hospitals
Research centres
Academies
 
... and basically to anyone who develops stem cells treatments
 




We make regenerative stem cells medicine possible on mass scale

Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. Key Developments

Cellect Biotechnology Receives Notice of Allowance for a Patent Covering a Key Composition of Matter and Method of Use
Jun 12 17
Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. announced that it has received a formal notice of allowance for a patent (Application No. 14/383,288) covering a key composition of matter and method of use. Similar to the patents granted previously, the current patent significantly enhances Cellect's protection of its core technology and its commercial applications by covering the various devices using the ApoGraft for selection of stem cells. The device is designed to enable single step cell selection in a simplified setting by an off-the-shelf product - a solution that currently does not exist and covering a wide range of unmet medical needs. The devices covered by the patent are essentially containers (a bag, column, tube, bottle, vial, flask or bioreactor) comprised of a biocompatible material and a biologically active apoptosis-inducing ligand immobilized to a surface in the inner side of the container. The device is adapted to cell selection of apoptosis-sensitive cells. Specifically, the patent is expected to give the Company full protection against any devices that make use of apoptosis for cell selection and is also expect to protect the method for using the device. Such devices, if successfully developed and approved, may enable selection of stem-cells and are expected to reduce fatal inflammatory responses such as graft versus host disease (GvHD) associated with stem cell transplantations.


Cellect Biotechnology To Be Delisted From TASE On September 3, 2017
Jun 9 17
Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. announced that, as previously disclosed, the Company is voluntarily delisting its shares from trading on the Israeli Exchange (the "TASE"), and moving to trade American Depositary Shares, each of which represents 20 ordinary shares, exclusively on NASDAQ. The last trading day on TASE will be on September 3, 2017. The decision to delist from the Tel Aviv exchange was taken as the Company's board of directors and management believe it will maximize shareholders' value in the medium and long term.


Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 29 17
Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company’s operating loss was ILS 5,371,000 compared to ILS 3,761,000 a year ago. Total comprehensive loss was ILS 12,451,000 or ILS 0.137 per basic and diluted share, compared to ILS 3,789,000 or ILS 0.049 per basic and diluted share, a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was ILS 5,168,000 compared to ILS 3,347,000 a year ago. Purchase of property, plant and equipment was ILS 69,000 compared to ILS 1,047,000 a year ago.

 Cellect Biotechnology Ltd. was founded in 2011 by Dr. Shai Yarkoni and Dr. Nadir Askenasy with a vision of becoming a world leader in regenerative medicine through the development of products facilitating immune stem cell selection.
The Company’s platform technology is based on the game changing perception that stem-cells functional properties rather than appearance should be used to develop superior identification, selection and utilization of stem cells.
The Company’s first product is designed to harness the critical function of sensitivity to specific apoptosis-agents. While these molecules induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in mature cells, they spare stem-cells. This differential sensitivity is used to dramatically improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation mainly by elimination of the severe adverse effects while suggesting significant reduction in costs of treatment.
Cellect has established proof of concept for its technology in animals, and has built a comprehensive IP portfolio protecting its development. The Company is now initiating formal preclinical trials for its first product, and is working on the development of its pipeline.

	PART II

	 

	INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS




	Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers


	Under the Companies Law, a company may not exculpate an office holder from liability for a breach of the duty of loyalty. An Israeli company may exculpate an office holder in advance from liability to the company, in whole or in part, for damages caused to the company as a result of a breach of duty of care but only if a provision authorizing such exculpation is included in its articles of association. Our articles of association include such a provision. We may not exculpate in advance a director from liability arising out of a prohibited dividend or distribution to shareholders.


	Under the Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law, a company may indemnify an office holder in respect of the following liabilities and expenses incurred for acts performed by him or her as an office holder, either pursuant to an undertaking made in advance of an event or following an event, provided its articles of association include a provision authorizing such indemnification:






	


	financial liability imposed on him or her in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment, including a settlement or arbitrators award approved by a court. However, if an undertaking to indemnify an office holder with respect to such liability is provided in advance, then such an undertaking must be limited to events which, in the opinion of the board of directors, can be foreseen based on the companys activities when the undertaking to indemnify is given, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances, and such undertaking shall detail the abovementioned foreseen events and amount or criteria;








	


	reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the office holder (1) as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or her by an authority authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, provided that (i) no indictment was filed against such office holder as a result of such investigation or proceeding; and (ii) no financial liability, such as a criminal penalty, was imposed upon him or her as a substitute for the criminal proceeding as a result of such investigation or proceeding or, if such financial liability was imposed, it was imposed with respect to an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent; and (2) in connection with a monetary sanction; and








	


	reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the office holder or imposed by a court in proceedings instituted against him or her by the company, on its behalf, or by a third party, or in connection with criminal proceedings in which the office holder was acquitted, or as a result of a conviction for an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent.




	Under the Companies Law, a company may insure an office holder against the following liabilities incurred for acts performed by him or her as an office holder if and to the extent provided in the companys articles of association:






	


	a breach of the duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not harm the company;








	


	a breach of duty of care to the company or to a third party, to the extent such a breach arises out of the negligent conduct of the office holder; and








	


	a financial liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third party.




	Under our articles of association, we may insure an office holder against the aforementioned liabilities as well as the following liabilities:






	


	a breach of duty of care to the company or to a third party;








	


	any other action which is permitted by law to insure an office holder against;





	II-1



	 



	 









	


	expenses incurred and/or paid by the office holder in connection with an administrative enforcement procedure under any applicable law including the Efficiency of Enforcement Procedures and the Israeli Securities Law, which we refer to as an Administrative Enforcement Procedure, and including reasonable litigation expenses and attorney fees; and








	


	a financial liability in favor or a victim of a felony pursuant to Section 52ND of the Israeli Securities Law.




	Under the Companies Law, a company may not indemnify, exculpate or insure an office holder against any of the following:






	


	a breach of the duty of loyalty, except for indemnification and insurance for a breach of the duty of loyalty to the company to the extent that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not harm the company;








	


	a breach of duty of care committed intentionally or recklessly, excluding a breach arising out of the negligent conduct of the office holder;








	


	an act or omission committed with intent to derive illegal personal benefit; or








	


	a fine or forfeit levied against the office holder.




	Under the Companies Law, exculpation, indemnification and insurance of office holders in a public company must be approved by the compensation committee and the board of directors and, with respect to certain office holders or under certain circumstances, also by the shareholders. See Management   Approval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law.


	Our articles of association permit us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders to the fullest extent permitted or to be permitted by the Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law, including expenses incurred and/or paid by the office holder in connection with an Administrative Enforcement Procedure.


	Prior to the closing of this offering, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our office holders to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders to the fullest extent permitted by our articles of association, the Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law, including expenses incurred and/or paid by the office holder in connection with an Administrative Enforcement Procedure. The indemnification thereunder will be limited to events determined as foreseeable by the board of directors based on our activities, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable
	under the circumstances.


	The maximum indemnification amount set forth in such agreements is limited to an amount which shall not exceed 25% of our net assets based on our most recently audited or reviewed financial statements prior to actual payment of the indemnification amount. Such maximum amount is in addition to any amount paid (if paid) under insurance and/or by a third-party pursuant to an indemnification arrangement.


	In the opinion of the SEC, indemnification of directors and office holders for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, however, is against public policy and therefore unenforceable.


	We have obtained directors and officers liability insurance for the benefit of our office holders and intend to continue to maintain such coverage and pay all premiums thereunder to the fullest extent permitted by the Companies Law.




	Item 7. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities


	The following is a summary of transactions during the three years preceding this offering, involving offers and sales of our securities which took place outside the United States and were not registered under the Securities Act:

The total gross proceeds we received in respect of the securities offered to the public according to the shelf offering totaled NIS 6,604,000. In connection with the

	Schedules not listed above have been omitted because the information required to be set forth therein is not applicable or is shown in the financial statements or notes thereto.





	Item 9. Undertakings






	(a)


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:








	(1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:








	i.


	To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;








	ii.


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement;








	iii.


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.








	(2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.








	(3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.








	(4)


	To file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to include any financial statements required by Item 8.A. of Form 20-F at the start of any delayed offering or throughout a continuous offering. Financial statements and information otherwise required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Act need not be furnished, provided that the registrant includes in the prospectus, by means of a post-effective amendment, financial statements required pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4) and other information necessary to ensure that all other information in the prospectus is at least as current as the date of those financial statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to registration statements on Form F-3, a post-effective amendment need not be filed to include financial statements and information required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Act or Rule 3-19 of this chapter if such financial statements and information are contained in periodic reports
	filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the Form F-3.








	(5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:








	i.


	If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B:








	A.


	Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and





	II-4



	 



	 









	B.


	Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness of the date of the first contract or sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date and underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
	fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date; or








	ii.


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first
	use.








	(6)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell securities to such purchaser:








	i.


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;








	ii.


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;








	iii.


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and








	iv.


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.








	(b)


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.





	II-5



	 



	 









	(c)


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
	question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.








	(d)


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:








	i.


	For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.








	ii.


	For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	II-6

	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 


	We have acted as Israeli
	counsel to Cellect Biotechnology Ltd., (the “Company”), an Israeli company, in connection with the registration by
	the Company of (i) an aggregate of 1,315,789 American Depositary Shares (the “Initial ADSs”), each representing twenty
	(20) ordinary shares, no par value per share of the Company, and warrants (the “Initial Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate
	of 986,842 ADSs (the "Initial Warrant Shares"), (ii) at the option of the Underwriters, the issue and sale to the Underwriters
	of an additional 197,368 ADSs (together with the Initial ADSs, the "ADSs") and Warrants (the "Additional Warrants")
	to purchase an additional 148,026 ADSs (the "Additional Warrant Shares") to cover over-allotments, if any, and (iii)
	warrants (together with the Initial Warrants and the Additional Warrants, the "Warrants") to purchase up to 78,947 ADSs
	(together with the Initial Warrant Shares and the Additional Warrant Shares, the "Warrant Shares") issued to the Underwriters,
	assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option (collectively, the “Securities”).  The Securities are
	being registered by the Company in connection with an underwritten public offering of the Company (the "Offering"). This
	opinion letter is rendered pursuant to Item 8(a) of Form F-1 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the “SEC”) and Items 601(b)(5) and (b)(23) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K promulgated under the United States Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).


	 


	In connection with this
	opinion, we have examined the originals, or photocopies or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of registration
	statement on Form F-1 (Registration Statement No. 333-212432) (the “Registration Statement”) filed by the Company with
	the SEC and as to which this opinion is filed as an exhibit, the Company’s Articles of Association, resolutions of the Board
	of Directors and Audit Committee which have heretofore been approved and relate to the Offering and such statutes, regulations,
	corporate records, documents, certificates and such other instruments that we have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis
	of our opinions hereinafter expressed. In such examination, we have assumed: (i) the authenticity of original documents and
	the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; (iii) the
	truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the corporate records, documents,
	certificates and instruments we have reviewed; (iv) the due execution and delivery of all documents where due execution and
	delivery are a prerequisite to the effectiveness thereof; and (v) the legal capacity of all natural persons.


	 


	We are members of the Israel
	Bar and we express no opinion as to any matter relating to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Israel
	and have not, for the purpose of giving this opinion, made any investigation of the laws of any other jurisdiction than the State
	of Israel.


	 




	 





	 





	 



	On the basis of the
	foregoing, and in reliance thereon, we are of the opinion that (i) upon payment to the Company of the consideration in such
	amount and form as shall be determined by the Board, the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs, when issued and sold in the
	Offering as described in the Registration Statement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and (ii)
	the ordinary shares underlying the Warrant Shares, when issued and sold by the Company and delivered by the Company against
	receipt of the exercise price therefor, in accordance with and in the manner described in the Registration Statement and the
	Warrants, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.


	 


	We hereby consent to the
	filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company’s Registration Statement and to the use of our name wherever it appears
	in the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not believe that we are “experts” within the meaning of
	such term as used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion as an exhibit or otherwise.


	 




	 




	Very truly yours,

	Re:

	Registration Statement on Form F-1



	 


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 




	 


	This opinion is furnished
	to you in connection with a Registration Statement on Form F-1 (Registration No. 333-212432) (as amended to date, the “Registration
	Statement”) filed by Cellect Biotechnology Ltd., an Israeli company (the “Company”), with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),
	for the registration and proposed offering of (i) an aggregate of 1,315,789 American Depositary Shares (the “ADSs”),
	each representing twenty (20) ordinary shares, no par value per share of the Company, and warrants (the “Initial Warrants”)
	to purchase an aggregate of 986,842 ADSs, (ii) at the option of the Underwriters, the issue and sale to the Underwriters of an
	additional 197,368 ADSs and Warrants to purchase an additional 148,026 ADSs (the “Additional Warrants” and together
	with the Initial Warrants, the “Warrants”) to cover over-allotments, if any, and (iii) warrants to purchase up to 78,947
	ADSs (the “Underwriter Warrants”) issued to the Underwriters, assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option (collectively,
	the “Securities”). We understand that the Securities are to be sold to the underwriters for resale to the public
	as described in the Registration Statement and pursuant to an underwriting agreement to be entered into by and among the Company
	and the several underwriters substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement (the “Underwriting
	Agreement”).


	 


	We are acting as U.S.
	securities counsel for the Company in connection with the Registration Statement. We have examined signed copies of the Registration
	Statement and have also examined and relied upon minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us
	by the Company, the articles of association of the Company, as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we
	have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinion hereinafter set forth.


	 


	In our examination
	of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to
	us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of the originals
	of such latter documents and the legal competence of all signatories to such documents. Other than our examination of the documents
	indicated above, we have made no other examination in connection with this opinion. Because the agreement governing the Warrants
	(the “Warrant Agreement”) and the Underwriter Warrants contain provisions stating that they are to be governed by
	the laws of the State of New York, we are rendering this opinion as to New York law. We are admitted to practice in the State
	of New York, and we express no opinion as to any matters governed by any law other than the law of the State of New York. In particular,
	we do not purport to pass on any matter governed by the laws of Israel. To the extent that the obligations of the Company under
	the Warrant Agreement may be dependent upon such matters, we have assumed for purposes of this opinion that (i) The Bank of New
	York Mellon (the “Warrant Agent”) is and will be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
	of its jurisdiction of organization, and is and will be duly qualified to engage in the activities contemplated by, and has the
	requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its obligations under, the Warrant Agreement; (ii) the Warrant
	Agent will be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, with respect to acting as an agent under the Warrant Agreement;
	and (iii) the Warrant Agreement will be the valid and binding agreement of the Warrant Agent, enforceable against the Warrant
	Agent in accordance with its terms.


	 


	 


	 





	 





	 




	 


	Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, when the Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the Warrant Agreement, and each of the Warrants and Underwriter Warrants, if and when issued and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Warrant Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.


	 


	The opinion set forth herein is rendered as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update such opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in the law which may hereafter occur (which may have retroactive effect). In addition, the foregoing opinions are qualified to the extent that (a) enforceability may be limited by and be subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including, without limitation, concepts of notice and materiality), and by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' and debtors' rights generally (including, without limitation, any state or federal law in respect of fraudulent transfers); and (b) no opinion is expressed herein as to compliance with or the effect of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.


	 


	This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. This opinion may not be relied upon for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without our prior written consent.


	 


	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.2 to the Registration Statement and to the reference to this firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement and in any Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.

	 


	 


	Very truly yours,

					Full Description



		Cellect Biotechnology Ltd, formerly Cellect Biomed Ltd, is an Israel-based company engaged in regenerative medicine through the development of products facilitating immune stem cell selection. The Company’s platform technology is based on the game changing perception that the functional properties of stem cells rather than appearance should be used for their identification, selection and utilization. The Company’s first product is designed to harness the critical function of sensitivity to specific apoptosis-inducing agents. While these molecules induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in mature cells, they spare stem cells. This differential sensitivity is used to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation mainly by eliminating severe adverse effects.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines."
 Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."
