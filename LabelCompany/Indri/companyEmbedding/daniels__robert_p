HOUSTON, Feb. 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Announces Leighton Steward Set to Retire from Board of Directors









EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:    EOG) (EOG) today announced the appointment of Robert P. Daniels to its Board of Directors, effective March 1, 2017. Daniels served as an Executive Vice President of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, a publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production company (Anadarko), from May 2013 until his retirement in December 2016, and as a Senior Vice President of Anadarko from May 2004 to May 2013. Mr. Daniels also serves as a director of MicroSeismic, Inc. and is active in industry and civic associations. 
"We are very pleased to welcome Bob to the EOG Board of Directors," said William R. "Bill" Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "He brings a record of accomplishment across many aspects of the global energy industry during his 32-year career at Anadarko, and his experience and sound judgment will be a valuable asset to our Board and company."
Leighton Steward Set to Retire as a DirectorEOG also announced that H. Leighton Steward has informed the Board of his decision to retire from the Board at the end of his current term and not stand for re-election as a director at its 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Steward was first elected a Director of EOG in 2004, following a distinguished career in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Beginning in 1962, Mr. Steward was employed in various management capacities at Shell Oil Company, including Chief of Exploration Operations, Worldwide. In 1982, he joined Louisiana Land & Exploration Company (LL&E) and served as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer from 1989 until 1997 when Burlington Resources acquired LL&E. Mr. Steward then became Vice Chairman of Burlington Resources and served in this position until his retirement in 2000.   
"I would like to thank Leighton for his 13 years of dedicated service to EOG," Thomas said. "Leighton has played an integral part in helping guide EOG through its evolution from a conventional natural gas company to its present position as the technical leader in unconventional oil and gas and the largest producer of oil in the lower-48 United States." Thomas concluded, "I have personally benefited from his wise counsel and guidance. On behalf of everyone at EOG, I offer Leighton and his wife Lynda our best wishes as he continues his retirement."
EOG Resources, Inc. is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China.  EOG Resources, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the ticker symbol "EOG."  For additional information about EOG, please visit www.eogresources.com.

Biographical/Historical Information
Robert P. Daniel was elected to become the fifth president
                           of Virginia State University(then Virginia State College)in
                           December of 1949. He assumed his duties in February of 1950.
                           Mr. Daniel however was not a stranger to Virginia State,
                           having been born on the campus in 1902. This strange twist of
                           fate makes Robert P. Daniel the only President of a
                           state-supported institution who was born on the campus, which
                           he would later serve as chief administrator.
                        
The historical background, which explains, this unusual
                           occurrence lay in the origins of the Daniel Family. The roots
                           of this family began in Louisa County Virginia, with Lucy
                           Langston, Robert Daniel's great great grandmother, who was
                           described as being of African and Virginia Indian origins.
                        
Lucy langston lived as the only wife of Ralph Quarles, a
                           white farmer and landholder in Louisa County. Although this
                           was not a legal union(black-white marriages had been outlawed
                           in Virginia in 1692), the two lived as man and wife for more
                           than thirty years.
                        
From this union came four children: Maria (Daniel's great
                           grandmother), Gideon, Charles and John Mercer Langston (who
                           become the first president of Virginia State in 1886-1887.
                           Ralph Quarles had given his common law wife her freedom
                           earlier and all four of these children were born free between
                           the years of 1800-1829.
                        
Maria Langston married early and her proud father gave her
                           a section of his farm as a wedding gift and also from her
                           father she recieved as her personal property her husband
                           Joseph Powell, who was a slave belonging to Ralph Quarles.
                           Maria Langston like other free blacks, (men and women) around
                           the state of Virginia were forced to hold their husbands and
                           or wives as their personal property in order to keep the
                           family unit together.
                        
From this union came Robert Daniel's grandmother Lucinda,
                           who like her mother also married a slave and was forced to
                           hold him as her enslaved property. Charles Daniel, father of
                           Robert Daniel was born in 1845 in Louisa and until around 1870
                           lived with his father and learned his trade in shoemaking.
                        
In 1871 he entered the Richmond Institute graduating from
                           the Normal Department in 1877 and its Academic Department in
                           1878. He studied law for one year at Howard University and
                           then accepted a teaching position in Danville, Virginia.
                        
In 1888 he was invited to become the Secretary of Virginia
                           Normal and Collegiate Institute. It was here in the old
                           Virginia hall that Robert Daniel and all but one of the eight
                           Daniel children were born.
                        
Robert P. Daniel graduated from Virginia Union University
                           in 1924. Later, he obtained his MA and his doctorate at
                           Teachers College. He also completed a post doctoral study in
                           Bible at the Union Theological Seminary in New York during the
                           summers of 1943 and 1946.
                        
Robert Daniel began his career in higher education at
                           Virginia Union University in Richmond as an instructor in
                           mathematics in 1924. Concurrently, Dr. Daniel supervised the
                           establishment of the Norfolk division of Virginia Union
                           University which later became the Norfork division of Virginia
                           State College. He was named president of Shaw University in
                           1936 until 1950.
                        
Dr. Daniel was elected president of Virginia State College
                           by the State Board of Education on December 15th 1949
