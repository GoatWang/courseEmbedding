I think about this every day and honestly, it doesn’t seem like 20+ years could possibly go by that quickly.  The healthcare marketplace has changed so much that it doesn’t seem like I have stood still for a minute.  Leading one of the country’s largest and most professional Healthcare staffing companies is not a job, it is my passion and truly an honor.  Cross Country Staffing has grown to meet the ever changing challenges for our clients and our healthcare professionals, all while remaining keenly aware of the important and critical need that is waiting at the bedside. How do I and my team do that?  We never lose sight of what it means to be a caregiver at the bedside, serving those who desperately need care. Those people in need could be your child, your parents and even you at times.  By understanding the critical importance practitioners play in delivering compassion and clinical help to others, Cross Country Staffing is able to offer solutions that are invaluable to our clients.  It is a circle of care, knowledge and quality that gives me confidence to lead, and keep leading, to create the best outcomes for all.   I take great pride in the large and successful organization we have built in the healthcare marketplace, but I get the most satisfaction in my confidence that we know our purpose and we strive to be the very best at what we do each and every day.ExperiencePresidentCross Country StaffingMay 2012  –  Present (5 years 3 months)Executive Vice PresidentCross Country StaffingSeptember 2006  –  April 2012 (5 years 8 months)PresidentCross Country StaffingJanuary 2000  –  August 2006 (6 years 8 months)Managment PostionsCross Country StaffingSeptember 1990  –  January 2000 (9 years 5 months)Sales and MarketingProcter & GambleJune 1986  –  August 1990 (4 years 3 months)SkillsTemporary StaffingTemporary PlacementRecruitingApplicant Tracking SystemsPermanent PlacementSourcingStaffing ServicesTalent AcquisitionNew Business DevelopmentAccount ManagementBusiness DevelopmentContract NegotiationHealthcareSalesBusiness StrategySee 22+Executive DevelopmentBusiness TransformationTeam LeadershipLeadershipEmployee RelationsHospitalsManagementTeam BuildingCoachingHuman ResourcesCold CallingInternet RecruitingContract RecruitmentCollege RecruitingOnboardingInterviewsHiringTrainingBenefits NegotiationTime ManagementVendor ManagementStrategySee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationMiami UniversityBusiness Administration and Management, GeneralBusiness Administration and Management, General1982  –  1986Middletown HighGroupsCross Country TravCorpsPhysician SearchPhysician & Nurse Staffing ProfessionalsTravel NursingMiddletown High SchoolNursing Beyond the BedsideHealthcare Executives NetworkView Vickie’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Vickie directlyView Vickie’s Full ProfileNot the Vickie you’re looking for?

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
