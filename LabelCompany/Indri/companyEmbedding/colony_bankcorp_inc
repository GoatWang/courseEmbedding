FITZGERALD, Ga., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Colony Bankcorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:CBAN), today reported net income available to shareholders of $2,433,000, or $0.28 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $1,761,000, or $0.21 per diluted share for the comparable 2016 period, while net income available to shareholders for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was $4,339,000, or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $3,417,000, or $0.40 per share for the comparable 2016 period.  This increase of 26.98 percent in net income for the comparable six month period was primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and noninterest income and a reduction in preferred stock dividends and loan loss provision.  "We are extremely pleased to report the progress of Colony.  In addition to the earnings reported, other quarterly highlights included total loan growth of $15.2 million and a reduction in nonperforming assets of $4.45 million," said Ed Loomis, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "After several years of nominal loan growth, we have realized a modest pace of loan growth for the first half of 2017.  We are cautiously optimistic that the economic recovery will offer more opportunities to expand our loan portfolio and further enhance shareholder value."
Capital
Colony continues to maintain a strong regulatory capital position to be categorized as "well-capitalized" by regulatory benchmarks.  At June 30, 2017, the Company's tier one leverage ratio, tier one ratio, total risk-based capital ratio and common equity tier one capital ratio were 9.72 percent, 14.33 percent,15.32 percent and 11.44 percent, respectively, compared to 9.47 percent, 14.28 percent, 15.39 percent  and 11.34 percent, respectively, at March 31, 2017.  The Company's capital ratios were all in excess of regulatory minimums required to be classified as "well-capitalized."
Net Interest Margin
During the second quarter of 2017, the Company reported net interest income of $9.82 million and a net interest margin of 3.49 percent compared to $9.53 million and 3.53 percent, respectively, for second quarter 2016, while net interest income for first half 2017 was $19.28 million and a net interest margin of 3.42 percent compared to $18.98 million and 3.50 percent, respectively, for first half 2016.  First quarter 2017 net interest margin was 3.35 percent, thus a significant increase in net interest margin this quarter.  This was attributable to increased loan balances, decreased lower yielding overnight funds and bond investments and increased earning asset yields due to recent Federal Reserve rate hikes.  As we shift more dollars out of lower yielding investments into higher yielding loans, we should continue to see net interest margin improvement.
Asset Quality
Asset quality reflects significant improvement as we "clean up" the balance sheet.  Substandard assets that include non-performing assets totaled $30.68 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $33.23 million and $42.56 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  Substandard assets adjusted for SBA guarantees to tier one capital plus loan loss reserve ratio was 23.77 percent, 25.67 percent and 31.12 percent, respectively, at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter end to $12.70 million or 1.63 percent of total loans and other real estate owned as of June 30, 2017.  This compares to $18.79 million or 2.47 percent and $23.33 million or 3.01 percent, respectively, as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.
Other real estate ("OREO") totaled $4.53 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $6.44 million and $10.18 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.   Though these levels remain at an elevated level, we continue to work diligently to dispose these properties at fair value.  There are several contracts that we anticipate closing in the near future to further reduce our OREO holdings.
In the second quarter of 2017 net charge-offs were $821 thousand, or 0.11 percent of average loans as compared to net charge-offs of $513 thousand, or 0.07 percent of average loans in second quarter 2016, while first half 2017 net charge-offs (recoveries) were $1,215 thousand, or 0.16 percent of average loans compared to ($78) thousand, or (0.01) percent of average loans for the comparable 2016 period.  The loan loss reserve was $8.04 million or 1.04 percent of total loans on June 30, 2017 compared to $8.92 million or 1.18 percent and $9.39 million or 1.23 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  Loan loss reserve methodology resulted in no loan loss provision for three months ended June 30, 2017  compared to $354 thousand for the comparable 2016 period, while first half 2017 provision for loan losses was $335 thousand compared to $708 thousand for the comparable 2016 period.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income increased in the comparable periods as noninterest income for six months ended June 30, 2017 was $4.79 million compared to $4.52 million in the comparable 2016 period, or an increase of 5.97 percent.  Secondary mortgage fee income increased $135 thousand or 53.36 percent, service charges on deposits increased $89 thousand or 4.33 percent and debit card interchange fees increased $102 thousand or 8.40 percent to primarily account for the increase.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased in the comparable periods as noninterest expense for six months ended June 30, 2017 was $17.03 million compared to $16.59 million for the comparable 2016 period, or an increase of 2.65 percent.  Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased 6.22 percent, occupancy expense was relatively flat and other noninterest expense decreased 2.45 percent for the comparable periods.  The efficiency ratio improved slightly at 70.52 percent for six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 70.97 percent for the comparable 2016 period.   The company continues to explore opportunities to improve its' operating efficiency.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
