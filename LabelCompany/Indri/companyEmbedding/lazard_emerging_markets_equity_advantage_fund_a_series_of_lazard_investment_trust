We’re Bullish on India—and You Should Be Too
 
We are bullish on India—and we’re not the only ones. Many experts are expecting great things over the next five years, as economics, structural shifts in equity allocations, cultural changes and more may be combining to drive the market for years to come.

Tilting Emerging Market Allocations toward Consumption, Growth & Quality
by Gaurav Sinha
For a global portfolio, emerging markets (EM) play several important roles. Some investors may invest in EM to diversify their global allocations, while others may be looking for faster growth.

Seeking Smarter Exposure to India’s Stock Market
by Gaurav Sinha
Driven by global “risk-on” and a host of local factors that we have covered in depth, the Indian equity markets have been doing very well for the last few months.

The answer might be surprisingly simple for this large and fairly complicated economy: Stick to investing in fundamentals.

Is Your EM Allocation Complete?
by Joseph Tenaglia

Emerging Markets Valuations
by Jeremy Schwartz, Christopher Gannatti & Jeff Weniger

We believe the current environment is setting up an interesting opportunity for the astute investor to capitalize on inexpensive equity valuations in high-dividend-paying Emerging Markets equities.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Lazard Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio







Fund Description
The Lazard Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies with strong, sustainable financial productivity at attractive valuations. The Portfolio invests primarily in equity securities, principally common stocks, of non-U.S. companies whose principal activities are located in emerging market countries and that we believe are undervalued based on their earnings, cash flow or asset values. The Portfolio’s returns are compared to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
Investment Strategy

Bottom-up approach to stock selection, the hallmark of Lazard’s relative-value investment style.
Fundamental analysis considers sustainability of returns, while accounting validation examines companies’ stated financial statistics.
Screening seeks to identify companies that are attractively priced relative to their financial returns.
Quantitative research techniques are used to monitor risks associated with industry and country concentrations in order to ensure diversification.

The performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Net-of-fees performance is measured from inception. Mutual fund performance fluctuates and currently may be lower than stated. An investor may obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end online at www.LazardNet.com. The investment return and principal value of the Portfolio will fluctuate; an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns reflect reimbursement of expenses as described in the prospectus. Had expenses not been reimbursed, returns would have been lower and the expense ratio would have been higher.
Please consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.

For example, we may collect personal information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, (including recordings of those telephone conversations of which we have made you aware), send us correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email) or contact us through our web site, subscribe electronically to our web site/publications if available, or when you have contact with us in person. We also collect personal information about you, when you apply for a position with us.
Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you includes your name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other personal information required to identify you for the purposes of Australian anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. We may also collect your username and password to log in to our website and the organisation for which you work, your position in the organisation and the dealings we have had with you during your employment with that organisation. In certain circumstances, we may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about membership of a professional or trade association, or membership of a trade union or police records of prospective employees. We may also collect your tax file number and other details in relation to your taxation position, when you make an application for one of our products.
There may be occasions when we need to source personal information about you from a third party. For example, we may collect personal information from a company for whom you work, other organisations with whom you have any dealings, a recruitment agency, a credit-reporting agency in relation to employment checks, an information service provider or from a publicly maintained record.
We may also collect web site visitors' contact information (like their e-mail addresses). We utilise "cookies" which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.
You may choose not to identify yourself, or to use a pseudonym when you deal with us. However we will need to identify you if we are required or authorised by Australian law, (such as anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation), or a court/tribunal order to do so or if it is impracticable for us to deal with you if you are not identified.
Purposes of collection
Lazard Pacific collects personal information for any one or some of the following purposes:

to provide you or your organisation with information about our product offerings;
to service our relationship with you, including managing your investments, responding to complaints or dispute you may have about our services and providing you with information from time to time about your investments;
to consider making offers of employment or for employment purposes;
to receive services from you or the organisation which employs you;
to advise you of new investment developments and to undertake other marketing activities such as informing you about any of our products and services that we think may be of interest to you,
to comply with our legal obligations.

If you do not provide some or all of the information requested, we may not be able either to provide you with an appropriate level of service or to fulfil another applicable purpose of collection.
We may disclose your personal information to our related bodies corporate, your consultant, custodian, asset consultant, broker, or financial adviser on your behalf or to your external professional service providers such as auditors, accountants or lawyers. If we receive personal information about you that we have not solicited, we will determine within a reasonable time if we could have collected it for any of the purposes listed above (which may require us to use or disclose it to do so). If we decide we could not have collected the information and it is not in a Commonwealth record, we will destroy or de-identify the information as soon as possible. Otherwise we will handle the information in accordance with this policy.
How we use or disclose your personal information
We will use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected or for any purpose for which you have consented. We may also use and disclose personal information for related purposes, such as dealing with any complaints or disputes you may have about our services and also to provide to you of information concerning investment developments and other services offered by us. We do not disclose personal information we collect to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to direct market their products and services to you. We engage third party contractors to perform services for us which involves the contractor handling personal information we hold. For example, we engage third party contractors such as Lazard Asset Management LLC, our parent company, to provide investment management services. In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.

We may from time to time send you promotional or marketing information about our products and services. You can ask to stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time by contacting us using the contact details below and expressing your preference to stop receiving some or all marketing communications or to only receive them in a particular way.
Other people's information which you provide to us

For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy and any collection Statement provided to you, as those matters relate to that individual, including our identity, how to contact us, our purposes of collection, our information use and disclosure practices, the individual's right to obtain access to and correct their information and to make a complaint, how we will deal with these and the consequences for the individual if the information is not provided
Sharing information within the Lazard group

Mutual Funds – Retirement Series

Lazard Retirement Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio







Lazard Retirement Series, Inc.
The Portfolios that comprise Lazard Retirement Series, Inc. (the “Fund”) are intended to be funding vehicles for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies offered by the separate accounts of certain insurance companies. Those contracts and policies are described in the separate account prospectuses issued by the insurance companies, over which the Fund assumes no responsibility.
Individuals may not purchase Portfolio shares directly from the Fund.
The investment objective and policies of the Portfolio may be similar to other funds/portfolios managed or advised by Lazard Asset Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"). However, the investment results of the Portfolio may be higher or lower than, and there is no guarantee that the investment results of the Portfolio will be comparable to, any other Lazard fund/portfolio. Portfolio shares may also be offered to certain qualified pension and retirement plans and to accounts permitting accumulation of assets on a tax-deferred basis ("Eligible Plans"). Differences in tax treatment or other considerations may cause the interests of policy owners and Eligible Plan participants investing in the Portfolio to conflict. The Fund’s Board of Directors monitors the Portfolio for any material conflicts and determines what action, if any, should be taken. For information about Eligible Plan investing, call 800-823-6300.Fund Description
The Lazard Retirement Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies with strong, sustainable financial productivity at attractive valuations.
Investment Strategy

A bottom-up approach to stock selection is the hallmark of Lazard’s relative-value investment style.
Fundamental analysis considers sustainability of returns, while accounting validation examines companies’ stated financial statistics.
Screening seeks to identify companies that are attractively priced relative to their financial returns.
Quantitative research techniques are used to monitor risks associated with industry concentrations in order to ensure diversification.

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund performance fluctuates and currently may be lower than stated. The investment return and principal value of the Portfolio will fluctuate; an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Returns reflect reimbursement of expenses as described in the prospectus. Had expenses not been reimbursed, returns would have been lower and the expense ratio would have been higher. The performance figures shown above do not include the cost of insurance fees associated with variable annuities, if fees had been included, the results would be lower.


THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED HEREIN IS ONLY AVAILABLE WITHIN A VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT.

Please consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.

Emerging Markets Valuations
by Jeremy Schwartz, Christopher Gannatti & Jeff Weniger

We believe the current environment is setting up an interesting opportunity for the astute investor to capitalize on inexpensive equity valuations in high-dividend-paying Emerging Markets equities.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI Emerging Market IndexSM (NDUEEGF) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance in the global emerging markets. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

		Investors in 2017 are facing a world in transition. The result of the U.S. presidential election and the earlier vote by British citizens to leave the European Union potentially reflect populist sentiment that appears to be challenging the decades-long march of globalization. What’s more, investors are recognizing that aggressive central bank stimulus may have reached its limits, and a transition to fiscal policy is at hand. Where should investors turn in such an environment? Our 2017 Outlook takes a trip around the globe, detailing the most important economic and investment themes as well as the portfolio implications from investing in a changing world.
	

		The global economy continues along its low-growth path, but there are a number of bright spots. In the U.S., despite the political uncertainty, a strengthening consumer is driving stronger growth. A large fiscal stimulus under the new administration could well provide another boost to the U.S. economy. And in many emerging markets the rebound that began in 2016 appears to have momentum, supported by higher commodities prices and structural reforms. Europe remains challenged by uncertainty about the future of the European Union, low growth and high unemployment. 
	

		A seven-year equity bull market has lifted stock valuations in the U.S., but many parts of the world are trading at discounts. Emerging markets and international markets are both below their 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio. Political and economic uncertainty remains, but there are bargains to be found for active investors seeking solid companies at attractive prices.
	

		U.S. government bond yields are near record lows, but are actually quite high relative to the rest of the world. Currently, 10-year Treasuries yield more than 85% of developed market sovereign debt. Even if U.S. rates rise and the new presidential administration’s policies are inflationary, the “lower for longer” trend seems sustainable well into next year while Europe and Japan continue to experiment with negative policy rates and quantitative easing.
	

		Results from the U.S. presidential election and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union highlighted a year where political populism gained momentum. But even amid that uncertainty, markets climbed a wall of worry in 2016. The lesson for this? It’s better to stick to your long-term plan and not get distracted by the latest political drama. Looking ahead, policy changes will affect individual businesses in different ways, so active investors will have an opportunity to build attractive company-by-company portfolios.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
