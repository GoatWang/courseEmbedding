He has enjoyed working alongside intelligent, disciplined people, while satisfying the needs of his successful and inspiring clientele.Retirement PlanningOne method of retirement planning is to project what you are currently saving and have accumulated to date and see if you will have enough to meet your retirement objectives. Use this calculator to determine when/if the money will run out during retirement and it will recommend additional savings if required.AnnuitiesFile Form 945 to report income tax withheld for 20152016 on all non-payroll items, including back-up withholding and withholding on pensions, annuities, IRAs, gambling winnings, and payments of Indian gaming profits to tribal members. Deposit any undeposited tax. (If your tax liability is less than $2,500, you can pay it in full with a timely filed return.) If you deposited the tax for the year in full and on time, you have until February 10 to file the return.Long Term CareThere are basically three ways to fund your long-term care needs: self-insure, qualify for Medicaid, or obtain long-term care insurance. Use this calculator to determine your potential long-term care needs and how long your current assets might last.College FundingTax-deferral can have a dramatic affect on the growth of an investment. With a state-sponsored 529 College Savings Plan your contributions can grow tax-deferred (some states allow contributions to be partially or completely deductible) and distributed income tax-free as long as distributions are used for qualified education expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board at higher education institutions. There is no limit on contributions but some states tend to limit contributions once the plan assets have reached a defined maximum (typically $200,000 - $250,000). Under a special election, you may make contributions of up to $70,000 per beneficiary in a single year without triggering a federal gift tax by accelerating five yearsÂ’ worth of contributions (gifts) as of 2013. Married couples may contribute $140,000 per beneficiary in a single year.* Assets are professionally managed by fund managers selected by the state. Participants can choose from two to almost 30 mutual fund-type investments. Control of the account remains with the contributor regardless of the age of the beneficiary. * A $70,000 gift is viewed as an accelerated gift over five years. Any other gifts to the same beneficiary by the contributor within five years may result in a federal gift-tax liability. If the contributor dies within the five-year period, a prorated portion of the contribution may be included in his or her taxable estate for federal estate tax purposes.InvestmentWealth ManagementLive the lifestyle youâ€™ve imagined. Our customized plans can help individuals at all stages create, accumulate and preserve their wealth. Learn MoreMutual FundsIt may surprise you how sales charges, management fees and lost opportunity cost can erode the total return on your mutual fund. Use this calculator to estimate the impact these charges may have on the growth of your investment.BondsTaxesTax PlanningYou worked hard to get here. Why be cavalier about taxes? By harmonizing your investments and tax planning, we are more able to execute various strategies that help grow your portfolio while protecting what you’ve worked so hard to achieve.Charitable GivingIf you have numerous itemized deductions such as mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc., it may make sense for you to itemize your deductions instead of using the standard deduction for your tax filing status. Use this calculator to help you make that decision.Estate TaxesRoth IRARoth IRA is a great way for clients to create tax-free income from their retirement assets. Yet, keep in mind that when you convert your taxable retirement assets into a Roth IRA you will generally pay ordinary income tax on the taxable amount that is converted. The conversion amount is not subject to the 10% early distribution penalty. Your tax-free potential is maximized if you pay the taxes from your current income or personal savings and not from your IRA. Individuals of all income levels are eligible to convert to a Roth IRA.Form 1065File a 2016-calendar year return (Form 1065). Provide each partner with a copy of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Partnerâ€™s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., or a substitute Schedule K-1. If you want an automatic 6-month extension of time to file the return and provide Schedules K-1 or substitute Schedules K-1 to the partners, file Form 7004. Then, file Form 1065 and provide the K-1s to the partners by September 15.Tax DeductionsOur Tax Organizer is designed to help you maximize your deduction and minimize your problems in preparing and filing your tax return. The organizer is comprised of seven parts, each developed to assist clients in collecting relevant tax information needed to properly prepare your tax return.Income TaxIf you are an employer and the monthly deposit rules apply, January 17 is the due date for you to make your deposit of Social Security, Medicare and withheld income tax for December 2016. This is also the due date for the nonpayroll withholding deposit for December 2016 if the monthly deposit rule applies. Employment tax deposits must be made electronically (no paper coupons), except employers with a deposit liability under $2,500 for a return period may remit payments quarterly or annually with the return.Tax DeferralDeposits into an annuity are not tax-deductible, however you don't have to pay taxes on the interest earned until you begin making withdrawals. This tax-deferral period can have a dramatic affect on the growth of an investment. Use this calculator to compare the tax advantages of saving in an annuity versus an account where the interest is taxed each year such as a CD.Capital Gains TaxesConsideration of NUA strategy is important if you are distributing highly appreciated employer securities from your prior employer's qualified plan, such as 401(k). Cost basis, the value of the employer contribution on your behalf is subject to ordinary income tax upon distribution. In addition, the 10% early distribution penalty may apply unless you have an exception (i.e. attained age 55 or older and separated from service). Taking in kind distribution allows the appreciation (NUA) above the cost basis to be taxed at the more favorable capital gains tax rate. For this reason, upon separation from service it may be more tax advantageous to transfer the employer securities to a regular taxable account instead of rolling the asset into an IRA where future distribution will be taxed as ordinary income.Send to PhoneKissinger Financial Services LLC10155 York Rd Ste 105, Cockeysville, MD 21030(410) 252-3400Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailKissinger Financial Services LLC10155 York Rd Ste 105, Cockeysville, MD 21030(410) 252-3400Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
