Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Earnings Growth Analysis
{arg3)’s earnings declined year-on-year because of the increases in loan loss provisions.  Its net interest income after provisions margins went from 49.86% to 49.63%.  The fall in earnings would have been worse were it not for the fact that the company’s net interest income margins improved, from 64.26% to 68.13%.  For comparison, net interest income margins were 64.26% and net interest income after provisions margins 49.86% in the immediate last period.

Net Loans and Total Deposits
A financial institution’s core operations represented by Net Interest Income and Net Interest Income after Provisions are dependent on both the growth and quality of its deposits as well as the growth and quality of its loans.  A firm could boost its interest income in the short-term by just increasing its loan assets with less concern about their quality – but this would eventually lead to greater loan loss provisions. Similarly a drive to increase deposits could result in higher interest expenses and eventually effect the firm’s equity. It is thus important to understand net interest income performance in context to loan loss provisions, loan assets and deposits. 


CIB-US‘s improvement in net interest income margins came in spite of relative drops in the levels of net loan assets and total deposits.  On an absolute basis, net loan assets changed 9.42% compared to the same period last year and 9.42% from the previous period.  Total deposits changed 8.16% compared to the same period last year and 8.16% from the previous period.

Cash Versus Earnings – Sustainable Performance?
It is important to examine a companyï¿½s cash versus earnings numbers to gauge whether its performance is sustainable.
CIB-US‘s change in operating cash flow of % compared to the same period last year is about the same as its change in earnings this period.  Additionally, this change in operating cash flow is about average among its peer group.  This suggests that the company did not use accruals or reserves to manage earnings this period, and that, all else being equal, the earnings number is sustainable.

Margins
Despite a decline in operating’s margins as well as a decline in pretax margins, the company’s earnings rose.
