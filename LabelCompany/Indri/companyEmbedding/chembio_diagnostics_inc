Human Diagnostics


HIV
Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.’s DPP® HIV 1/2 Assay, SURE CHECK® HIV 1/2, HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK®, and HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK® DIPSTICK tests are easy-to-perform, single-use diagnostic tests for the rapid, visual detection of antibodies to HIV 1 and HIV 2.
The standard screening test for antibodies to HIV is the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or ELISA. This test requires two visits to a clinic or medical facility – something that is not always feasible. Rapid, point-of-care (POC) tests have been developed which produce results within 20 minutes or less and are less costly for testing agencies to perform due to the fewer outreach visits required to deliver results. Also, studies have shown that rapid tests are as sensitive and specific as conventional immunoassays.
Syphilis
Utilizing Chembio’s patented Dual Path Platform technology, DPP® Syphilis Screen & Confirm permits the simultaneous yet separate detection of both Trep and non-Trep markers at the point-of-care. The test format allows use in point-of-care settings, therefore represents a considerable advance in diagnosis as well as in time to treatment and ease of use.
Standard diagnosis of Syphilis is currently done using two different laboratory-based serologic tests, namely a non-treponemal screening test, usually either the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), followed by a more specific treponemal confirmatory (EIA) assay. Chembio has developed the first dual non-Treponemal & Treponemal POC Syphilis test.
Syphilis, caused by the bacterial spirochete Treponema pallidum, is a significant source of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. In fact, it is estimated that there are over 12 million cases of Syphilis occurring worldwide every year.
Chagas
Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.’s Chagas STAT-PAK® Assay is easy-to-perform, requires no cold chain storage, uses a minimal sample size, and provides visual detection of antibodies to T. cruzi.
Because traditional testing methods require laboratory equipment and storage, they aren’t effective methods in the more rural areas where Chagas is most common.
Recognized as one of the world’s neglected diseases, Chagas is a major public health concern in Latin America and is a growing concern in the United States and regions of Europe as the number of infected immigrants increase. Chagas is transmitted by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite of the hematophagous triatomine insect, and may cause cardiomyopathy, syndromes of the esophagus and colon, and eventually in chronic myocarditis resulting in high morbidity and mortality. It is curable if detected and treated early, but there is no effective treatment once it has become chronic.

					Full Description



Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (Chembio), incorporated on May 14, 1999, and its subsidiary, Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc., develop, manufacture, market and license rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs) that detect infectious diseases. The Company's products include rapid tests for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1/2 antibodies, and a multiplex rapid test for the detection of HIV and Syphilis antibodies. The HIV 1/2 rapid tests employ in-licensed and lateral flow technologies that are used with all blood matrices as samples, and are manufactured in a standard cassette format, a dipstick format, and a barrel format. The barrel format is distributed by a distributor in the United States and by Chembio and its designated distributors outside the United States. The Cassette format is distributed by Chembio and its designated distributors around the world. The Company's HIV 1/2 rapid antibody detection test incorporates the Dual Path Platform (DPP) POCT technology. The DPP HIV 1/2 Assay detects antibodies to HIV 1 and 2 in oral fluid samples, as well as in all blood matrices.The Company's product pipeline, which includes a multiplex rapid test for earlier detection of HIV by detecting P-24 antigen, as well as antibodies, a test for Hepatitis-C, and a multiplex test that detects HIV and Syphilis specific antibodies, is based on the DPP technology. With the DPP and the lateral flow platform, the Company participates in the point-of-care market segment of the global in-vitro diagnostic market. POCTs, by providing prompt and early diagnosis, can reduce patient stays, lower overall costs, improve therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes. POCTs also prevents needless hospital admissions, simplify testing procedures, avoid delays from central lab batching and eliminate the need for return visits.Lateral Flow Rapid HIV TestsThe Company's lateral flow rapid HIV antibody detection tests are qualitative yes/no tests for the detection of antibodies to HIV 1 and 2 with visually interpreted results available within approximately 20 minutes. StatSure Diagnostics, Inc. (SDS) owns interest in the rights to the SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay that is subject to the existing marketing and distribution agreement with Alere, Inc. The Company's SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay is sold in the United States as Clearview Complete. Outside the United States, Chembio markets the SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay primarily through distributors. The SURE CHECK HIV 1/2 Assay is the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived, European CE-marked, and has been pre-qualified by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Company's third lateral flow HIV test is the HIV 1/2 STAT PAK Dipstick.DPP HIV 1/2 AssayAs in the case of the Company's lateral flow HIV tests, its DPP HIV 1/2 Assay is also a qualitative yes/no test for the detection of antibodies to HIV 1and 2, delivers visual results within approximately 20 minutes, is simple to use, has a shelf life of over 20months, and does not require refrigeration. This product is used with oral fluid samples, as well as with all blood matrices. This product also incorporates the Company's oral fluid collection and storage system that enables samples to be extracted in buffer solution before application to the test device, and also enables the extracted sample to be stored and retested or potentially tested for multiple conditions in future product applications.DPP HIV-Syphilis Multiplex TestDPP HIV-Syphilis Multiplex Test allows for the detection of antibodies to both HIV and Syphilis on a single test device within approximately 20 minutes. In certain global/public health settings, this product may provide a means of rapid detecting both markers in a single test procedure at the point of care as compared with performing separate rapid tests for each indication.The Company competes with Orasure Technologies, Inc., Alere, Inc. and Trinity Biotech.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
