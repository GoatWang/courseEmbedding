HERO: Insiders Vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released by the NASDAQ for the 11/14/2014 settlement date, and Hercules Offshore Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 11.06 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.85. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

First Week Of HERO July 2015 Options Trading
Investors in Hercules Offshore Inc saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 2015 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

Top Buys By Directors: Webster's $805.5K Bet On HERO
The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
