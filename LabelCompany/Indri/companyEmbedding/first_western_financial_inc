Since we opened our doors in 2004, we have invested more than $19 million in the form of donations, sponsorships, community development loans, and affordable housing investments to organizations and projects that are making a lasting difference in our communities.
First Western Trust’s associates are involved with a number of nonprofits in our communities, donating their time to local organizations by serving on boards and advisory committees, as well as through direct volunteering.
 



FW Gives
In an effort to ensure our resources provide the most benefit, we conducted a materiality survey to understand the needs and interests of all of our stakeholders: our community members, associates, shareholders, and clients. With this input, we built our corporate social responsibility program and focused on three philanthropic pillars that our stakeholders felt were most relevant to our business and the community at large. Our three pillars are:
 



Economic Development through Entrepreneurship
We recognize that the best way to help our communities prosper is to support the growth of a successful workforce and local businesses. By partnering with organizations dedicated to helping individuals build skills for the workplace and by fostering entrepreneurship, we help our communities grow stronger.



The Arts
Art awakens creativity and fresh responses to thinking, feeling, and seeing. It can serve as an outlet and as inspiration. Unfortunately, in many communities, art education and access is extremely limited. We support organizations that help both local artists and also introduce children and adults to a broader cultural experience as a way to inspire new ideas and new ways of thinking.



Women & Girls
Studies have shown that when communities put money and time into women and girls, they achieve a multiplier effect with those women reinvesting in the community that helped support them. Even in our local cities, we see disparate gender statistics that need change. By working with organizations dedicated to self-sufficiency and education for women and girls, we seek to make a positive impact on our communities.



FW Gives Programs
FW Connects Day
Our associates believe in giving back to the communities where we work and live. In 2014, we instituted our first-ever FW Connects Day, an annual event that brings together First Western associates to participate in a day of community service. Each of our teams participates in a project, working together, to support one of our three philanthropic pillars: Economic Development, The Arts, and Women & Girls. In 2016, our associates gave over 500 hours of their time to community service projects during FW Connects. We look forward to seeing the impact we have in 2017.
#WealthIsAbout Grants Contest
At First Western Trust, we understand that wealth is about so much more than money. It’s about making an impact on your community and leaving a positive legacy for generations to come. To help support our communities, we launched the #WealthIsAbout grants contest in 2016. Through the grants contest, we give $7,000 to one organization in each of our markets that supports The Arts, Economic Development, or Women & Girls as voted on by the community. Learn more about our #WealthIsAbout grants contest and our philosophy of wealth.
Community Connections Committee
Each of our local teams is deeply involved in the communities in which we live and work, and at our Denver headquarters, we have a volunteer committee that organizes monthly charity events to foster greater community involvement. Through volunteer events, such as cooking and clean-up projects, as well as charity drives and contests, the Community Connections Committee is committed to helping our teams find meaningful opportunities to give back throughout the year.

TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE
 All Deposit Accounts
 FDIC deposit insurance is now $250,000 per depositor
IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT THE EXPIRATION OF UNLIMITED COVERAGE FOR NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS
By operation of federal law, beginning January 1, 2013, funds deposited in a noninterest-bearing transaction account (including an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account) no longer will receive unlimited deposit insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Beginning January 1, 2013, all of a depositor’s accounts at an insured depository institution, including all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount ($250,000), for each deposit insurance ownership category.
For more information about FDIC insurance coverage of transaction accounts, visit www.fdic.gov.
By clicking the above link you will be directed to another site outside of First Western Trust. First Western Trust provided this link for your convenience, but assumes no responsibility for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of the aforementioned website.
 
NOTICE TO ALL COMMERCIAL CLIENTS
Federal law requires that Commercial/Business clients be provided with this notice.
Certain federal and/or state laws such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act or Third Party Service Providers’ Rules may limit or prohibit certain transactions such as (but not limited to) those coded as unlawful Internet gambling transactions.
First Western Trust Bank (“The Bank”) may decline to accept, process or pay any transaction that we believe to be illegal or unenforceable (regarding your obligation to pay us or otherwise) under applicable law; or which is otherwise limited or prohibited, including but not limited to any transaction involving or relating to any unlawful Internet gambling or illegal activity.
These restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful internet gambling.
 
SECURITY STATEMENT
Security and Encryption
Our online banking system brings together a combination of industry approved security technologies and recommended customer security procedures. We feature a password controlled system, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, VeriSign Digital ID, a router and firewall to regulate incoming and outgoing information to protect both your information and ours.
Browser
Security begins with your browser. Our SSL encryption has been certified as a 128-bit secure server. Only a web browser such as Netscape Navigator 4.7 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher will be supported. These browsers support 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption. This provides a secure channel for data transmission. When you connect to our server, all requests sent by you and responses from us are encrypted.
Authenticity
To begin a session, you will be asked for your Log-In ID and user password. We use a “three strikes and you’re out” philosophy to protect our customers. After three unsuccessful attempts, the system locks out the user until someone from the bank intervenes and verifies the customer and password. Digital ID verifies the user’s identity and establishes a secure connection.
Data Transfer
Because of the security features of both the required browser and our SSL encrypted server, the connection is secure. Data traveling over the internet between the user and the bank is encrypted with the top industry standard, Secure Sockets (SSL) protocol.
Router and Firewall
All log-in requests are first filtered through a router and then through a firewall to determine whether the user is granted access to the requested destination and to protect the internal bank network from unauthorized outside access. The router is responsible for determining who has access to which parts of internet banking. The firewall is a higher level of security to further filter and verify access.

About Us

There’s a reason we’re first.
Since 1910, we’ve provided the people of Arkansas with a first-rate place to bank. Today, we operate in both Western Arkansas and Northwest Arkansas.
Why do people choose First Western? Because we have a reputation for delivering outstanding banking services in a warm, positive atmosphere. We’re a “one-stop shop” for financial services – and not just things like checking accounts, savings accounts and loans. We offer all types of personal and business insurance, from auto to home to health. We’re always ready to help with investment products and mortgages. Plus, we’re a leader in small business banking.
When you bank at First Western, you also show your hometown pride. Because when you bank here, your money stays in your community. We’re an independent bank owned by our employees.
Switch banks for the last time.
Whatever you need – from a checking account that earns interest to insurance protection for your family – we’re ready to help. Once you switch, you’ll definitely notice the difference. Contact us now.
