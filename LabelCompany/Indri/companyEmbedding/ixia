        IxNETWORK 
  



    L2-3 network infrastructure performance testing that scales to business needs
  





















PROTOCOLS 
IxNetwork emulates a wide variety of protocols using Ixia's CPU-based test port. Each test port supports an independent multi-core CPU running protocol emulations under a Linux operating system. Using the IxNetwork test application, each Ixia test port is capable of emulating thousands of routers or bridges with millions of reachable networks and hosts. Users can easily scale the size of emulated topologies by adding additional test ports. Combined with line-rate traffic generation and QoS measurement capabilities, the CPU-based load modules verify advertised topologies and networks for reachability and QoS performance.

Test Results—Statistics viewer
The IxNetwork statistics viewer is a powerful tool for viewing and analyzing real-time results and generating test reports.

Aggregate statistics are displayed hierarchically, with the ability to drill-down to group-level and flow-level statistics.
Different modes to view traffic statistics – Instantaneous, Cumulative, or both
CSV files can be used to capture a single results view or, at the global level, to capture all results in real-time. An integrated CSV viewer is provided to view large-result files.

Resource Manager
Often expertise for different protocols lies within different members of a testing team. A common pain-point for our customers was the lack of a collaboration tool to aid them in incrementally building configurations. With the Resource Manager, users can now piece-meal their configurations together. The Resource Manager allows users to save different pieces of their configurations, like protocols and traffic elements, and then build a configuration by re-using saved elements in their current configuration.

  Resource Manager
It also allows users to clearly see changes made to their resources/configurations by using a “diff” functionality within the application. Using the Resource Manager is a powerful way to collaborate and quickly build expertise with a team.
Reports
Building a test-results report requires test data. IxReporter introduces a new database, referred to in the application as an “object model.” The object model is populated by a testing application (like IxNetwork) with the test configuration parameters and the test results. All of these “objects” can be included in a report, usually in a table or chart. With this powerful concept, tables and charts can be created which combine statistics and configuration information as well as have multiple protocols.
Automation
IxNetwork provides powerful GUI-based automation with Test Composer and QuickTest. It also has a robust feature set for GUI-to-script and API-based automation. IxNetwork’s automation is simplicity at its best. Test scenarios are set up using IxNetwork’s step-by-step GUI, and then a single button-press generates a TCL test script. Scripts may be modified and combined in any fashion. When the script is run, the IxNetwork GUI watches the execution – providing real-time statistics and state information.

Quicktest – web edition
With the release of Native IxOS chassis (XGS2/12 HSL with Linux OS), RFC 2544 QuickTest can be initiated with a web browser. The new HTML5 web-based GUI eliminates the need to install IxNetwork client on Windows. The result is an all-Linux test platform that consumes a smaller memory footprint, starts/loads faster, and executes quicker.
Built-In Data Capture and Analysis
Internet protocols are complex – multi-protocol emulations even more so. IxNetwork includes a built-in tool that captures control-plane traffic along with line-rate data-plane traffic, merging both into a single capture file. The optional Analyzer module is a sophisticated network analyzer, with the ability to display protocol ladder diagrams. IxNetwork allows you to trigger and filter control and data plane packet captures based on user-defined packet field.
Impairment
IxNetwork supports a list of ImpairNet® modules that emulate real-life network impairments. Testing a variety of applications that run over WAN networks, ImpairNet offers unparalleled scaling, ease-of-use, and measurement accuracy. Refer to Ixia web site for ImpairNet data sheet.















IxNetwork is a comprehensive network infrastructure performance testing solution. It scales to handle most powerful devices and largest networks, from routing and switching to data center ethernet and software defined networking.
Problem: Network complexities put performance to the test
Organizations have long tested their networks for scale and performance. But as networks become increasingly complex, so do the challenges of ensuring peak network performance and resiliency. Forget about simply testing for sluggish response times: The right testing tool must now assess complex network topologies with thousands of network devices, emulate sophisticated traffic flows, and conduct stress tests under countless scenarios and network conditions.

Solution: A reliable test system for complex and unpredictable networks
IxNetwork delivers performance testing under the most challenging conditions. Capable of generating multiple terabytes of data and analyzing up to 4 million traffic flows simultaneously, IxNetwork scales to handle the most powerful devices and the largest networks. With its enhanced real-time analysis and statistics, this powerful solution emulates everything from routing and switching, Data Center Ethernet and Software Defined Networking to Broadband Access and Industrial Ethernet for comprehensive testing. And graphical user interface (GUI) wizards make it easier for IT teams to meet a wide range of performance requirements with minimal resources.

Ixia Brings in ProtectWise to Strengthen Cloud Visibility Product
Wyatt CarlsonJuly 18, 20172:46 pm PTSecurity startup ProtectWise and software testing and visibility provider Ixia partnered to create an integrated product that helps enterprises monitor their public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.
ProtectWise will be integrating its security platform with Ixia’s visibility platform. As enterprises continue to move workloads to the cloud, they lose network packet visibility, and Ixia’s CloudLens aims to solve this. And ProtectWise’s platform provides automated threat detection.

The ProtectWise platform uses sensors throughout the network that can detect immediate attacks. It also keeps a record of attacks dating back for years. The data is consolidated in the cloud and can be accessed by using a search tool.
The ProtectWise network sensors rely on packets in order to do their analysis. When the sensors are deployed in the public cloud, the platform relies on CloudLens to send it packet level data; as there is no other way to get packet data in public cloud environments, wrote an Ixia spokesperson in an email to SDxCentral. “CloudLens is an agent that gets installed as a Docker container within the OS of ProtectWise’s monitoring tool instance in AWS [Amazon Web Services] or Azure,” wrote the spokesperson.
From there, CloudLens is able to filter, process, and manipulate traffic in cloud environments. For example, it lets users go into the network to pull packet data, which can be sent to ProtectWise’s platform for further inspection and analysis.
This partnership has been in the works since Ixia announced the availability of CloudLens for the public cloud in April. Ixia announced a number of security and performance monitoring companies that can interoperate with CloudLens including ProtectWise, FireEye, Dynatrace, CA Technologies, LogRhythm, NTOP, AppNeta, NetFort Technologies, and Savvius.
Founded in 2013, ProtectWise has raised more than $67 million in funding and is based in Denver. The company’s founders and engineering team come from security companies like McAfee, Palo Alto Networks, and Symantec.

IxCatapult








Future-proofing Mobile Networks

Product MenuOverview

IxCatapult validates the ability of mobile network infrastructures to accommodate fast-rising data volumes and related spikes in signaling traffic. Users can conduct protocol conformance, functional, and load/stress testing to ensure the performance and scalability of the network control plane of both core and radio access network (RAN) devices.
Increasing signaling traffic impacts user authentication and authorization, mobility, charging, policy management, and QoS. The failure of elements such as subscriber databases and mobility management entities (MMEs) can in turn cause costly service interruptions.
IxCatapult emulates control plane signaling on a city scale to validate performance and capacity. Simulating virtually any network node—and multiple nodes simultaneously—the solution represents properly functioning and misbehaving devices to preempt issues and validate deployments in the lab.

Industry-leading IxCatapult capabilities include:

RNC Testing: Ixia’s RNC Test solution measures Radio Network Controller (RNC) performance to prevent issues from arising under load and in complex mobility scenarios. Testing features complete functional and performance testing of UTRAN network components and HSPA+ capabilities. Delivering the industry’s highest signaling load test capacity, Ixia emulates multiple network entities to reduce test requirements.


SS7 Testing: Ixia’s Message Generator and Traffic Simulator™ (MGTS) evaluates SS7 over Legacy and SIGTRAN technology used to interconnect telecom networks in increasingly IP-based networks. MGTS validates the functionality and performance of signaling and media gateways, emulating SS7/PSTN entities and SS7 application databases to reduce test costs and development time.


Femtocell testing: IxCatapult tests femtocell access points and gateways used to extend indoor cellular coverage. Testing addresses integration challenges inherent in integrating femtocells into existing networks. In the absence of mature standards, IxCatapult equips users to develop test scripts for successful implementations.

Equipment vendors and service providers worldwide use IxCatapult during product development, QA testing, and network buildout. Using a unique protocol-centric model, the solution precisely measures the real-world behavior of mobile infrastructure devices as well as overall network performance.

Application and Threat Intelligence (ATI) Program
Ixia’s ATI program offers BreakingPoint users a simple way to create test flows of the malicious and user traffic their network must withstand. It is a subscription service that provides updates every 2 weeks to ensure delivery of the industry's most up to date application and threat intelligence, and includes 300+ stateful application protocols and 36,000+ attacks (exploits, malware, DoS).
The ATI program enables users to:
Add new applications and attacks without changing the OS because the attacks and applications are not embedded into the BreakingPoint operating system
Develop and add custom application protocols and attacks without involvement of the Ixia security and applications team due to the BreakingPoint CAT license
Stay up to date on the most used application protocols, via Ixia’s Evergreen program that ensures updates every 30 days for select protocols including AOL Webmail, AOL Instant Messenger, Google Talk, Google Gmail, ICQ, Jabber, MSN Hotmail, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Messenger
Stay up to date with malware and botnet attacks with our monthly malware and botnet
Quickly initiate a comprehensive and targeted test in about 30 seconds using the ATI Super Flows, real-world mixes of applications and their behavior (i.e., one Super Flow creates the exact application traffic from a large European service provider, at night, with smartphone users)
Ensure testing with real-world application traffic mix with ATI native application protocol support that includes a configurable weight per protocol and dynamic application content to simulate reality so application data changes exactly as a real application would
BreakingPoint test traffic is defined hierarchically from libraries of Flows, Super Flows and Application Profiles. Each of the library elements can be used directly or modified to the user’s needs. Flows are application protocols that are provided by ATI for common applications. Super Flows are a sequence of Flows that create a series of behaviors of client or client and server operations. An example of a Super Flow would be the behavior of a Gmail session, where a Gmail Client steps through all the required sequences of resolving DNS query, conducting TLS authentication session with a Gmail server, retrieving the mail and then closing the session. Application Profiles are container for groups of Super Flows that a BreakingPoint test component will use to create a specified test.

As of the publishing of this data sheet, BreakingPoint includes 3,000+ Superflows from over 300 applications and this library continues to grow with ATI updates.

Application Protocol Simulation
Real-World application simulation with Dynamic content
Each protocol is natively implemented, not a PCAP replay
Configurable application actions (flow) to simulate multiple and dynamic protocol behavior
Configurable application action parameters
High-level web application protocol implementation such as YouTube, Gmail, eBay, and more. No need to set the HTTP layer, BreakingPoint will convert the application layer into HTTP.
Ability to simulate all application protocols as part of a single protocol mix
Each application protocol is a unique application flow; it can be of the same protocol with a different behavior, or a different application protocol

Use of real files as application attachments (i.e., email attachment) or protocol content
Application token support
The token goal is to deliver a dynamic and realistic traffic pattern for each application
Tokens allow the user to randomize data as part of the application flow, to prevent devices from accelerating bandwidth or detecting static data patterns
Tokens can be used on both the local level (a specific action such as HTTP Get URI) and global level (protocol level such as host name)

Application Markov token support
Markov token is a unique way of converting documents into new documents, which is a random data by Word instead of by Character, which allows the data to look realistic, but at the same time to be dynamic

Application IF/ELSE with Regex support
The IF/ELSE action delivers the ability to make decisions from both client and server side, during the data flow.
Once the action detects a specific match of data, it can decide what to do next. In addition, it can capture data from the flow and reuse it later when needed.

Application protocol realistic behavior
Applications can open more than one session (i.e., Web browsing will open a “main page” connection and all sub objects will be retrieved over sub connections)
Application multi-sessions are always synced (i.e., FTP control and data session, RTSP and RTP, SIP and RTP)
Applications, as part of a Protocol MIX, are weighted by Bandwidth or Users; in order to reflect realistic application usage. Below is a sample enterprise application protocol MIX distribution


Strike List
The Strike List is the central location for customizing attack traffic. From the Strike List, you can customize attacks by grouping Strikes together. The Evasion Profile settings establish the evasion techniques for a single group of Strikes. The Strike List is the top-level security group. It contains all of the attacks and evasion options that will be used in a security test. You can use any default Strike List to exploit vulnerabilities in various hosts and applications; however, if you need more granular control over the attack traffic, you can customize your own attacks through the Strike List.
When you create a new Strike List, it will have its own set of options that determine which evasion techniques to use in the attack traffic. You can create as many Strike Lists as you want. Each Strike List will have its own set of Strike Options, so you should create a Strike List for each unique set of evasion options that you need. The BreakingPoint device provides you with a set of default Strike Lists that have been custom-designed by the Security team at Ixia to target specific types of security testing – whether strikes targeting port scanning, specific protocols, or unpatched.

 

Strike Specifications


Malicious and Attack Simulation Strikes


Over 6,000 Strikes such as SQL Inj, XSS, buffer-overflow

Key BreakingPoint Test Components
BreakingPoint is controlled from a web browser using the HTTPS protocol, so no local client installation is required. It offers a single GUI for management results in simple, central control of all components and capabilities. Alternatively, a tool command language (TCL) API and TCL shell interface is provided for building and executing automated tests.

Ixia’s Strike Center web site allows immediate access to OS releases, new application protocols, and attack updates and documentation. Best of all, updates of applications and attacks (StrikePacks) do not require reboot or licenses.
The steps for building a test include:
Reserving the physical ports that will be used
Defining a Network Neighborhood
Building an Application Profiles and/or Security Strikes List that will be used in the test
Choosing the test components that will be assigned to the network interfaces
BreakingPoint includes many pre-built common tests, Application Profiles and Strike Lists that can be used directly or modified to fit the exact needs of the test.
Network Neighborhood
The Network Neighborhood is a powerful tool that defines the possible addresses the system can use for its generated test traffic and determines how the system will allocate those addresses for use. All addresses used in test traffic generated by the BreakingPoint device must follow the protocol rules as though the addresses were a real host existing within a real subnet on the network.
Addressing information for each test interface is designated with component tags, each defining the host addresses that can be used in the test traffic, as well as the subnet and routing information for those hosts. The addressing will fill the entire subnet, but you can limit the number of addresses by defining a range for the network.
The Network Neighborhood determines:
The type of network in which the device is operating (e.g., routed, switched, or VLAN).
The addresses that can be used for the Ethernet, source, and destination IP addresses.
After the system looks at the Network Neighborhood you have selected for the test, it will look at the component tags that are selected for each interface. These component tags contain the subnets that the system will use to derive its addressing.
BreakingPoint test components are virtual devices that enable you to test how well your device will operate at different network layers. Each test component comes with a set of parameters, which you can use to create the type of traffic you want. Descriptions of the primary BreakingPoint test components follow. See the BreakingPoint Reference manual for more details.
Application Simulator
Application Simulator enables you to connect your BreakingPoint hardware network elements to a single network device or interconnected network infrastructure elements. Application Simulator comment models both the client and server side of the communication transactions. This type of test is referred to as a two-arm test. The Application Simulator test component allows you to generate application traffic flows. This test component is typically be used in conjunction with other test components to simulate real world traffic. The Application Simulator test component uses an App Profile to determine what types of application flows to send to the DUT. The App Profile contains a set of flow specifications that defines the protocol, client-type, and server-type with the traffic that will use.
Client Simulator
Client Simulator enables you to connect your BreakingPoint hardware to a real server (device under test) so the chassis can act as a client generating connections to the server. This type of test is commonly referred to as a one-arm test. Client Simulator sends a single Super Flow to the DUT and enables you to search for specific responses from the DUT.
Client Simulator uses Conditional Requests in Super Flows that define the specific responses (i.e., strings or patterns) you expect to see from the DUT. The Client Simulator component will track the number of responses from the server that match the string matches defined within the Conditional Requests for the Super Flow.
Security
The Security test component can be used to test network security devices – such as IPSs, IDSs, firewalls, anti-DDoS applications, and proxies. It measures a device’s ability to protect a host by sending strikes and verifying that the device successfully blocks the attacks. Simply select a Strike List and an Evasion Setting to create a security test, or use one of the default options. Additionally, the Security Component allows you to edit Evasion Profiles to override any evasion options that are configured for an Evasion Setting or configured within the Strike List.
BreakingPoint's Security Component subjects a network security device to 6,000+ attacks under CVE-ID, BugTraqID, and OSVDB to validate its blocking capabilities; or to confirm the stability of devices under attack.
One-arm security testing allows you to test the authenticity of the attack traffic generated by the Security component. It targets a specific destination address (or range of addresses) through the test port of the chassis. It is designed to trigger the vulnerabilities in your device, rather than exploit them for access; therefore, this mode will put your device in a crash condition, and it will not result in code execution on the device under test.
Security NP
The Security NP component enables generation of malware traffic at high load. It is used for validating the attack detection performance of the IDS/IPS engine. This component has the same behavior as the Security Component, however has higher performance as it is executed in the Network Processor rather than by the CPU.
Session Sender
The Session Sender test component enables testing of pure TCP and/or UDP behavior and performance. It is also capable of performing advanced DDoS attacks.
It uses a unique pair of source and destination port numbers for TCP, UDP, ICMP or combinations session capacity testing. Each session uses a unique combination of source addresses, destination addresses, source ports, and destination ports.
Routing Robot
The Routing Robot component delivers RFC2544 benchmark testing and network DDoS simulation. By using an FPGA technology, it is capable of generating wire speed traffic of IP and UDP stateless traffic. The RFC2544 standard defines several test cases for switching and routing benchmarks including packet-loss, max throughput and network latency
The Routing Robot test component determines if a DUT routes traffic properly by sending routable traffic from one interface and monitoring the receiving interface to see if the traffic is successfully received. Routing Robot functions is commonly used in testing forwarding performance test such as RFC2544.
Bit Blaster
The Bit Blaster test component analyzes a device’s ability to handle high-speed traffic by identifying whether or not the DUT receives and sends packets without corrupting or dropping them. The Bit Blaster component only transmits layer 2 frames, which means that it can only be used in a switching environment. For routing or NAT environments, use the Routing Robot test component to generate high-speed, routable traffic. Bit Blaster functions include:
Stack Scrambler
The Stack Scrambler test component tests the integrity of different protocol stacks by sending malformed IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and Ethernet packets (produced by a fuzzing technique) to the device under test. The fuzzing technique modifies a part of the packet (checksum, protocol options, etc.) to generate the corrupt data.
Recreate
The Recreate test component supports importing capture files in standard libpcap (used by tools such as tcpdump) and libpcap files compressed with gzip. This component allows you to capture traffic in your production network and then have BreakingPoint replay that traffic during a test exactly as captured, or with additional enhancements to create even more realism. For example, Recreate captures each PCAP flow’s complete L4-7 data, stored in individual files and grouped according to protocol. Then Recreate can be configured to adjust IPv4 Configuration, IPv6 Configuration, Source Port, TCP Configuration, and Data Rate of the captured flows.
Templates
There are templates for each test component that have been pre-configured for the BreakingPoint system. They cannot be modified or deleted; however, you can use them as a baseline for creating new templates or add a template from scratch.
Templates contain predefined component configurations that can be reused in other tests. All parameter definitions, interface selections, and descriptions are stored in the template. Once you save a component as a template, it will be listed under the Load a Template section of the component type on which it is based. These templates can be treated like any other test component.
Templates are particularly useful if you are using the Tcl Interface to test a device. You can create templates that contain the necessary test configuration parameters built into them. Therefore, when you reference the template from the Tcl interface, you will not need to configure any of the parameters for the component.
Device Under Test Profile
A DUT Profile defines the connection settings for the device under test – such as the connection method, connection parameters, interface speed, and global scripts. The BreakingPoint device will use these settings to establish a connection to the DUT for automation purposes. You can use Expect scripts (also known as global scripts) to automate your device testing; for example, you can create scripts that will create VLANs. To create a DUT Profile, you must clone an existing DUT Profile. Cloned DUT Profiles will inherit all connection parameters and global scripts of the parent DUT Profile; however, you can reconfigure the cloned DUT Profile as desired.
Reporting
BreakingPoint provides extensive reports that provide detailed information about the test, such as the components used in a test, the addressing information, the DUT profile configuration, the system versions, and the results of the test.
All reports include an aggregated test results section, which provides the combined statistics for all of the test components. It also includes the information over time, to pin-point a potential error within the timeslot it happened.
All reports are automatically generated in HTML and viewable with a web browser; however, you may export the test results in XLS, HTML, PDF, RTF, CSV, or ZIP (CSV files). Reports are automatically generated each time a test is run and are viewable from the Results page.
The Comparison Report feature allows you to run multiple iterations of the same test on different load modules or different ports and compare the results. You have the option of comparing all sections of the tests, or you can select only certain sections to be included in the comparison.
Example of the reported test results:
Per application protocol: Throughput, Transaction Rate, Success/Unsuccessful, Response Time, and more

For stateful TCP, one-way latency is reported by using TCP time stamp with an accuracy of uSec

Results are collected every 1 second
