Bar Harbor Bank & Trust

 



General Description

Founded in 1887, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust is a community bank with 15 branches from Lubec to Topsham, Maine. We offer a full-range of financial services products for families, businesses, non-profit organizations. Member FDIC.
Bar Harbor Bank & Trust is a true community bank. We recognize, appreciate, and support the unique people and culture in the places we call home.
Centennial Plans

Founded in 1887, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust played an important, if indirect, role in the creation of Acadia National Park. The Acadia connection was provided by Judge Luere B. Deasy, president of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust from 1893 to 1929. Judge Deasy’s interest in the island’s heritage and nature conservation, combined with his prominence, made him a logical choice to represent George B. Dorr and the other Acadia advocates. Dorr was the irrepressible guiding force behind the park’s development. Deasy was the chief counsel for land acquisitions during the interminable court proceedings that stretched from 1906 to 1916. Deasy was also a trustee of the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations, the pioneering conservation organization that first protected the lands that became Acadia.
Contrasting the past with the present, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust has sustained its commitment to the progress and well-being of the permanent residents of Mount Desert Island, while welcoming millions of visitors to Acadia each year. The bank’s employees continue to be highly involved in their local communities, as was Judge Deasy and other forebears of the bank. Bar Harbor Bank & Trust values the preservation of the park for current and future generations and is pleased to provide its support in celebrating the centennial birthday of the nation resource found in our own backyard. Acadia National Park is truly a gift to our nation and our own local community, to be valued, treasures, and celebrated.

Trust Services

Bar Harbor Trust Services provides trust administration, investment management, and financial advisory services for individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and municipal clients throughout Maine and northern New England. We’ve been helping clients achieve their financial goals since 1887. As of December 31, 2014 our clients have entrusted us with over $430 million of their assets. We have about 500 client relationships and 780 individual accounts.   Trust & Fiduciary Services  Investment Management  Estate Planing  Nonprofit ServicesMaine ValuesBar Harbor Trust Services can trace its roots to the founding of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust in 1887. We have patiently grown and expanded throughout the state. We manage each client’s assets thoughtfully and prudently with attention to detail, and with a commitment to doing what is best for each client. Many financial firms are simply in-state subsidiaries of out-of-state companies. Bar Harbor Trust Services has chosen to remain independent and local. We live here, work here, and share your aspirations for our community.  Personal ServiceThe trend with large firms is toward 1-800 Call Centers, Internet Service Teams and “Smart Apps” for your cell phone. In contrast, our clients still enjoy a face-to-face relationship with a familiar account officer. Our clients get to know us personally and we pride ourselves on service that exceeds their expectations.  Attention to DetailWe assign two Trust Officers to each client account; an Administrative Officer and an Investment Officer. Clients typically work most closely with their Administrative Officer for day-to-day issues and include their portfolio manager for investment reviews. We meet wherever it is convenient; the client’s home, office, our Trust office or the nearest office of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust. Experienced PersonnelOur experience is earned over more than 125 years of serving our clients. Our professional staff has an average of 21 years experience. Our officers and support staff offer expertise in a wide variety of specialized areas including personal trust, estate planning, non-qualified retirement plans, investment management, municipal investing, and nonprofit services. Bar Harbor Trust Services has the strength, experience and commitment to service to meet all of your trust and investment needs.

The layers of color, the multiple levels of flavor, the beautiful blend of recognizable tastes dancing with daring dashes of your favorite liquor, all of these things magically meld in a mixed drink to make memorable (or sometimes not so memorable) nights for your customers. Crafting mixed drinks is truly a science, which is why it is often called "mixology." In this guide, we'll take a look at several key components to help your bar staff become proficient professors in the field of mixology and craft the coolest cocktails in town.Beer Clean GuideMost beers should produce a 1/2" to 1" tall head in a properly cleaned glass, depending on the style and size of glassware. A properly cleaned beer glass means you might only have to fill up a 16 oz. glass with 14 oz. beer - more glasses per barrel and more profit for you! And to make sure you get the best presentation, make sure to check out our beer glass guide .Types of Cocktail MixesConvenient, Easy-to-Use, Money Saving, Time Saving, Tastes Great!
