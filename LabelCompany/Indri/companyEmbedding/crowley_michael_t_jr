Michael T. Crowley Jr., an executive with Bank Mutual Corp. for 45 years, will step down as chief executive officer this summer, according to a document filed Friday with regulators.
Bank Mutual President David A. Baumgarten will succeed Crowley as CEO when Crowley retires on or about July 1, the document says. Baumgarten is a former Associated Banc-Corp executive who joined Bank Mutual in 2010.
Crowley will continue to serve as chairman of the company.
Brown Deer-based Bank Mutual is the parent company of Bank Mutual banks. It is the third-biggest bank with headquarters in Wisconsin.
