      ■ As CEO of Carolina Power & Light Company, William
      Cavanaugh III forged a merger in 2000 between his company and Florida
      Progress Corporation to establish Progress Energy as a regional leader in
      the energy business. While many power and utility companies began to
      expand quickly after industry deregulation, Cavanaugh and Progress Energy
      took a more cautious approach, primarily focusing on its core businesses.
      Cavanaugh's conservative approach helped Progress Energy weather
      industry scandal, a recession, and the vagaries of deregulation that
      eventually plagued the more aggressive power companies. Industry analysts
      subsequently praised Cavanaugh's approach of keeping the company
      true to its utility roots while taking disciplined steps toward expansion
      and diversification.
    

      FROM THE HIGH SEAS TO HIGH WIRES
    

      A native of New Orleans, Cavanaugh received his bachelor's degree
      in mechanical engineering from Tulane University. He then spent the next
      eight years in the U.S. Navy, primarily serving in the navy's
      nuclear-powered submarine program. After leaving the navy in 1969 as a
      lieutenant commander, Cavanaugh joined the Mississippi-based Entergy
      Corporation, where he spent the next 23 years working in a variety of
      positions. At first he held management positions with the company's
      various subsidiaries, including Arkansas Power & Light, Louisiana
      Power & Light, and Mississippi Power & Light. He went on to
      serve as group president of Energy Supply; chairman, CEO, and president of
      Entergy Operations; and chairman, CEO, and president of System Energy
      Resources.
    

      In 1992 Cavanaugh left Entergy and joined Carolina Power & Light
      (CP&L) in Raleigh, North Carolina, as president and COO. At the
      time, the company was a sleepy utility with one of the industry's
      worst run plants. Over the next eight years, Cavanaugh would guide the
      company toward establishing facilities that would rank among the best in
      the industry.
    

      When Cavanaugh was appointed CEO of CP&L in 1996, few industry
      analysts paid much attention to the change in leadership. Within two and a
      half years, however, the company had undergone major adjustments; many
      insiders noted that Cavanaugh sparked more change in the company in that
      short amount of time than it had experienced in several decades. Cavanaugh
      oversaw several expansion efforts, including a $354 million acquisition of
      the North Carolina Gas Company, the building of a $250 million gas turbine
      plant in Rowan County, and the purchase of the Internet company Interpath
      Communications, which Cavanaugh integrated with CP&L's
      Caro-Net Telecommunications. Cavanaugh also made significant changes in
      senior management and accelerated the company's cost-cutting
      efforts.
    

      WARY OF DEREGULATION
    

      Early on in his stint at the helm of CP&L, Cavanaugh took a
      cautious approach to the increasing deregulation of the power industry.
      Between 1989 and 1994 Congress had passed laws that opened up wholesale
      power purchasing and energy trading, with utilities sharing their grids
      and buying and selling
       electricity from each other. As a result, many companies optimistically
      saw deregulation as the beginning of a new era of expansion and profits;
      many states geared up for a more competitive retail market. Cavanaugh and
      CP&L, on the other hand, remained skeptical. In an article in 
      
        Business North Carolina
      
      , the State Utilities Commission Attorney Gisele Rankin told Edward Martin
      that when a legislative commission began to debate the best method of
      deregulating retail electricity in North Carolina, CP&L became
      "known as the just-say-no crowd" (November 2003).
    

      While companies such as Duke Energy, Enron, and others pressed North
      Carolina for deregulation, Cavanaugh stood firm in his beliefs. Cavanaugh
      and CP&L were concerned that states with higher electricity rates,
      like New York, would end up draining power from low-cost states like North
      Carolina and force CP&L and other electric utilities to raise their
      prices. He also saw deregulation as removing companies' incentives
      to invest in power grids and new plants as they focused on becoming the
      lowest bidders for supplying power. In direct confrontation with Duke
      Energy, Cavanaugh and CP&L initiated concerted lobbying in an
      attempt to sway legislators and donated over $60,000 to a pair of groups
      aligned against deregulation, which assisted two people in attaining
      appointments to the 23-member commission assessing the issue. Cavanaugh
      told Martin, "We felt deregulation of electricity was such an
      important step—fiddling around with something that already worked
      well—that we should be careful not to put the system in
      jeopardy" (November 2003).
    

      Cavanaugh rebuffed most offers at expansion and diversification. He was
      especially wary of Enron, which offered CP&L a 10-year contract for
      its industrial customers. Cavanaugh later recalled that he couldn't
      figure how other companies were accomplishing such a great deal of
      marketing and trading; that is, in spite of high volume, sources of actual
      profits were unclear. In opposition to these other companies'
      tactics, Cavanaugh focused his company on the core business of serving
      wholesale and retail customers. He believed that CP&L was growing
      and strong, and he was unwilling to go overseas or to any other place
      where the company would be unfamiliar with the business landscape. Many
      analysts saw Cavanaugh's philosophy as leaving CP&L out of
      the ultimately profitable bigger picture.
    

      MAKES A MOVE
    

      While Cavanaugh may have been cautious about deregulation, he was not
      going to let CP&L be left behind. In 2000 he negotiated the
      purchase of Florida Progress Corporation, the parent company of Florida
      Power. The merger of the two midsized companies would allow CP&L to
      compete in a rapidly consolidating electricity industry and also in a new
      geographic market. Cavanaugh was named chairman and CEO of the newly
      formed Progress Energy.
    

      Cavanaugh credited the small financial windfall from the merger with
      partially offsetting a recent decrease in customer demand for electricity,
      which had come about as a result of moderate weather, reduced purchases by
      industrial consumers, and intentional temporary shutdowns at a number of
      nuclear plants. Taking into account the layoffs of 1,200 employees that
      had resulted from the merger, the company was on track to notch $100
      million in savings through 2001 and an additional $75 million by 2003.
      Cavanaugh remained optimistic about the company's synthetic-fuel,
      merchant-generation, and marketing businesses, which sold electricity on
      the wholesale market. He told Kris Hundley of the 
      
        St. Petersburg Times
      
      , "Our plans for solid earnings and dividend growth have not
      changed" (July 26, 2001).
    

      GUIDES THROUGH TROUBLED TIMES
    

      While Cavanaugh remained optimistic, he faced a struggling economy, which
      reduced the forecast demand for energy. After the terrorist attacks of
      September 11, 2001, Cavanaugh saw the future of energy further altered as
      the economic slowdown deepened. Cavanaugh told Martin in 
      
        Business North Carolina
      
      , "We quickly saw that the business of double-digit growth was not
      going to be possible" (November 2003).
    

      Although Cavanaugh stood on the sidelines during much of the initial
      activities of deregulation, he had made limited forays into other
      businesses, not all of which were successful. Expansions of gas-turbine
      plants in Georgia and North Carolina were halted when wholesale gas prices
      plummeted in 2002. The company's telecommunications subsidiaries
      also stumbled.
    

      Cavanaugh proceeded to try to slim down the company by selling such
      noncore subsidiaries as Progress Rail Services, a rail freight-car lease
      and repair service. Cavanaugh then reemphasized the company's focus
      on earning profits through production of regulated electricity. In 2002
      the company struggled with less-than-expected earnings of $529 million on
      gross revenue of $1.9 billion. The company's earnings per share
      dropped to $2.46 in 2002, compared to $2.64 in 2001. Most industry
      analysts noted that the company's performance may not have been
      stellar in 2002, but it consistently outperformed other utilities as it
      weathered energy-business scandals and the economic downturn.
    

      In a presentation before the company's Annual Meeting of
      Shareholders in May 2003, Cavanaugh told shareholders, as reported on PR
      Newswire, "Progress Energy's strategy is to remain true to
      its utility roots while making strategic investments in related business
      that can generate higher growth" (May 14, 2003). By the end of the
      year, Cavanaugh's strategy appeared to be working. The company
      reported consolidated net income of $782 million, or $3.30 per share, in
      2003. In addition, the company made successful efforts to sell further
       noncore assets—including the North Carolina Natural Gas subsidiary
      purchased through CP&L in 1999—which helped the company pay
      down its more than $11 billion of debt. These sales helped reduce the
      company's capital expenditures and push its leverage (the use of
      debt to increase returns) to below 59 percent. At the same time, the
      company raised its dividends for the 16th consecutive year, including the
      years when it was still CP&L.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE: BE COMPETITIVE
    

      Cavanaugh noted that success goes beyond capturing and holding a market
      share. He stressed that management must comprise good competitors if the
      company is to be able to pursue and capitalize on opportunities. As
      reported in 
      
        Executive Speeches
      
      , Cavanaugh told attendees of the 23rd National Conference of the American
      Association of Blacks in Energy that achieving success "also means
      working with the best suppliers and—at the heart of the
      matter—attracting and retaining the best employees"
      (December 2000).
    

      Industry analysts and coworkers noted that Cavanaugh was a high-caliber
      leader who stressed excellence and ethics. In 2002 Progress Energy was one
      of only three S&P 500 companies to be recognized by Standard and
      Poor's for providing the most complete and detailed information
      possible to investors. As reported by PR Newswire, Cavanaugh observed,
      "In this post-Enron era, it's more important than ever for
      corporations to be clear and up-front about their financial condition and
      business practices. Acting with integrity is very much the Progress Energy
      way" (May 14, 2003).
    

      DECIDES TO RETIRE
    

      Although Cavanaugh had originally planned to retire on February 1, 2004,
      the Enron scandal of 2002 and general turmoil in the industry led the
      company's board to ask him to delay his date of departure.
      Cavanaugh agreed but said that he would still want to retire close to the
      initially scheduled date if the financial situation improved. By January
      of 2004 Cavanaugh and the board believed that the state of the industry
      had calmed down considerably and that Progress Energy was on firm footing.
      Cavanaugh retired from his position as CEO in March 2004 and from his
      position as chairman the following May.
    

      Industry analysts agreed that Cavanaugh turned over the reins of a company
      with a solid financial foundation. He accomplished this feat by making
      wise decisions that successfully led Progress Energy through a recession
      and through the uncertainty of deregulation. In a Progress Energy press
      release, J. Tylee Wilson, the presiding director, noted, "Bill made
      Progress Energy a great place to work for employees and an exceptional
      value for investors" (January 23, 2004).
    

      Upon retirement, in addition to spending more time with his family,
      Cavanaugh intended to remain involved in nuclear issues for the power
      industry. He served on the governing board of the World Association of
      Nuclear Operators as well as the board of directors of Edison Electric
      Institute, the Nuclear Energy Institute, and the Research Triangle
      Foundation.

William K. CAVANAGH III


1979 - 2014
Obituary
Condolences

































William K. "Billy" Cavanagh III SAN FRANCISCO, CA - William K. "Billy" Cavanagh III, 35, passed away, peacefully, at 7:05 p.m. on Nov. 30, 2014, at St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco, Calif., with his family by his side.  Billy was born Feb. 2, 1979, in Evanston, Ill., to Colleen Doran Cavanagh and William K. Cavanagh, Jr. He grew up in Springfield and he especially loved Washington Park. He attended St. Agnes Grade School and Springfield High School where he met many lifelong friends.  He loved to read and played competitive soccer for many years. In the intervening years, Billy traveled all over the country and eventually found his way to San Francisco where he lived for the past eight years. He had many challenges but was always cheerful and free-spirited and never lost his zest for life or love of great music. Always kind and generous, Billy was able to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving during his last illness.  In addition to his parents, he is survived by his sisters, Caitlin Doran Cavanagh of Chicago, Ill., Nelly Cavanagh of Springfield, Ill., and Anna Elizabeth Cavanagh of Washington, D.C., and brother, Conor Cavanagh of Las Vegas, Nev. Billy is also survived by his grandmothers, Eleanor Cavanagh of Springfield, Ill., and Venita Enright of Scottsdale, Ariz., and many aunts and uncles.  Preceding Billy in death were a sister, Sarah Caroline Cavanagh, and a brother, Sean Francis Cavanagh.  Family and friends are invited to stop by Café Moxo, 411 E. Adams St., Springfield, IL, on Dec. 18 from 5-8 p.m. to remember and celebrate Billy's life. As Billy benefited from their community support, the family requests that any donations which some may wish to make should be directed to the University of California Regents to the attention of Alex Weil at 982 Mission St., San Francisco, CA 94103.

Specialties of Cavanaugh William E Attorney:

Attorneys
Bankruptcy Lawyers
Personal Injury Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Bankruptcy Lawyers: Bankruptcy law provides for the development of a plan that allows a debtor, who is unable to pay his creditors, to resolve his debts through the division of his assets among his creditors.The philosophy behind the law is to allow the debtor to make a fresh start, not to be punished for inability to pay debts. Bankruptcy law allows certain debtors to be discharged of the financial obligations they have accumulated, after their assets are distributed, even if their debts have not been paid in full. Some bankruptcy proceedings allow a debtor to stay in business and use business income to pay his or her debts.


Personal Injury Lawyers: A personal injury lawyer is a lawyer who provides legal representation to those who claim to have been injured, physically or psychologically, as a result of the negligence or wrongdoing of another person, company, government agency, or other entity. Personal injury lawyers tend to practice primarily the area of law known as tort law. Even though personal injury lawyers are trained and licensed to practice virtually any field of law, they generally only handle cases that fall under tort law including work injuries, automobile and other accidents, defective products, medical mistakes, and slip and fall accidents.

  December 18, 2014  Bill so sorry for your loss---May billy rest in peace.              December 17, 2014  Bill I am so sorry for your loss. My heart and prayers go out to you and your family     Bobbi Claypool, Forsyth, IL                                     December 17, 2014  Dear Bill, Colleen, and family, I have all of you in my prayers. I have a few things to say about Billy. We had lunch dates with our kids before they were even in school and he was the cutest, busiest little boy around. I remember taking up a collection to get him a gift when he was sick and in the hospital during the St. Agnes years. When asked what he might want , he said some book that beyond my ability to read. Shortly after he was home he thanked me and said, he really enjoyed reading it! It was about 5 inches thick! Whenever he would see me in later years he would always give a big hug and look deep into your eyes when he talked to you! I know this is terrible difficult for all of you and my sincere sympathy is offered to you. Love, Kathy              December 17, 2014  Bill, Colleen and families...I read, with sadness, about the passing of your son. I offer my heartfelt prayers as you begin the healing process.     Jack Howard, St. Louis, MO
