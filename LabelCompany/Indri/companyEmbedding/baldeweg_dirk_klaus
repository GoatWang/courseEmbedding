About this book




Die Bewertung ganzer Unternehmen zählt zu den zentralen Themen der betriebswirtschaftlichen Forschung. Die Frage, wie Unternehmen der New Economy zu bewerten sind, ist bisher allerdings noch offen. 

Auf der Basis einer eingehenden Analyse der besonderen Eigenschaften von Unternehmen der New Economy sowie der Charakteristika der relevanten Entscheidungssituation zeigt Dirk K. Baldeweg, welchen Anforderungen ein Bewertungsverfahren gerecht werden muss. In der Untersuchung vorhandener Hilfsmittel zur Unternehmensbewertung erweist sich die Simulation dynamischer Modelle als wesentliches Bewertungselement. Ausgehend von der Entwicklung generischer Einflussketten wesentlicher Beurteilungsgrößen entwickelt der Autor ein eigenes dynamisches Modell. Durch die Verknüpfung von Szenarioanalyse und dynamischer Modellierung setzt er sich eingehend mit bekannten Unsicherheitsquellen auseinander. Ein Fallbeispiel illustriert das neue Verfahren und zeigt, dass es die Bewertungsqualität deutlich verbessert.
