General Questions about Bluetooth
 




What is Bluetooth?

Bluetooth wireless technology is an international open standard for allowing intelligent devices to communicate with each other over short range wireless links. It allows any sort of electronic equipment - from computers and cell phones to keyboards and headphones - to make its own connections, without wires, cables or any direct action from a user.
A distinctive advantage for Bluetooth wireless technology is its low power consumption, enabling extended operation for battery powered devices like cell phones, personal digital assistants, and web tablets.


Is it hardware, software or both?

Bluetooth wireless technology includes both hardware and software components. The hardware consists of a Bluetooth module or chipset, which is comprised of a Bluetooth radio (transceiver) and baseband or a single-chip that contains both. Another part of the hardware is the antenna. The radio transmits and receives information via the antenna and the air interface. The chip also contains a digital signal microprocessor, which is part of the baseband. The key functions of the baseband are piconet and device control - for example, connection creation, frequency-hopping sequence selection and timing, modes of operation like power control and secure operation, and medium access functions like polling, packet types, packet processing and link types (voice, data, etc.).
The software consists of the protocol stack. Broadcom offers Widcomm® Bluetooth protocol software for embedded systems (BTE), Windows (BTW), and Windows-CE (BTW-CE). All Widcomm software provides simple integration, powerful diagnostics and the shortest possible time to market.


Is it primarily a cable-replacement technology?

Bluetooth is primarily a cable replacement technology, enabling users to connect to a wide range of computing and telecommunications devices without using cables.


Can Bluetooth wireless technology be used for applications other than cable replacement?

The real magic of Bluetooth wireless technology lies in the concept of a Personal Area Network (PAN) and ad hoc connectivity. Through the Discovery Service, PAN devices are capable of spontaneously joining into a network as they approach each other. This occurs only while the devices are in close proximity: the devices leave the network as they are removed from proximity. The opportunity for automatic, unconscious connections between mobile devices provides new freedom for end-users.


How does Bluetooth wireless technology compare to IEEE 802.11?

802.11 offers features that are complementary to Bluetooth wireless technology - such as greater bandwidth and greater range. But these same features are also limiting for 802.11 because the technology is a poor choice for small devices with limited battery power.


Do Bluetooth wireless technology and IEEE 802.11 interfere with each other?

Bluetooth wireless technology and 802.11b/g both use the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) unlicensed spectrum, and in some configurations can interfere with each other. If the Bluetooth and 802.11b/g antennas are more than 3 meters apart, however, interface in minimal. Co-existence schemes such as adaptive frequency hopping have been implemented to address potential interference issues and Broadcom has introduced its InConcert® coexistence technology, which mitigates interference problems.


What is the range for a Bluetooth device?

Depending on the specification of the device, Bluetooth wireless technology works within a 30- to 300-foot radius.





What is the usable data rate?

The raw (over-the-air) data rate is 1 megabit/second. If two devices are talking to each other in an optimal manner, the channel will support 700 kilobits/second in one direction with a reverse channel of over 50 kilobits simultaneously. Bandwidth allocation is very flexible, and completely under the control of the device which establishes the connection.


How does Bluetooth wireless technology handle security issues?

Security is a critical issue in any wireless system Bluetooth provides several components that ensure secure wireless connections. First, at the highest level, the application itself can provide authentication and encryption, and is used in the most critical applications. Second, the Bluetooth specification provides for authentication and flexible encryption at the baseband level. The third level of security is based on the transmitter characteristics of low power and frequency hopping, which helps deter casual eavesdroppers.


Who developed the Bluetooth standard?

Bluetooth wireless technology is different from historical wireless standards in that it is an open standard that is consistent worldwide. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), comprised of leaders in the telecommunications, computing, and network industries, is driving development of the technology and bringing it to market. The Bluetooth SIG includes promoter companies 3Com, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia and Toshiba, and more than 2000 adopter companies.
The goal of the SIG is to promote the standard, ensure interoperability, define the radio characteristics, link protocols and profiles, and provide free access to the Bluetooth standard. The benefits to producers include standardized connectivity and protocols, opportunities for product enhancement and differentiation, and reduced interoperability concerns.
Broadcom is an associate member of the Bluetooth SIG and participates in various Bluetooth SIG working groups.


What are some of the elements of the Bluetooth standard?

The Bluetooth standard outlines specifications for the following:

Hardware: radio, baseband controller, other components
Software: link controller stack, host controller interface, host drivers
Qualification: protocols, testing services, review and certification



What is Bluetooth product qualification?

Product qualification is a way to ensure that Bluetooth products really do work together and a forum for demonstrating that a company's product complies with the Bluetooth specifications (per the Adopters Agreement). The qualification process involves protocol conformance tests, profile interoperability tests, compliance declarations and documentation reviews as described in the Bluetooth Qualification Program Reference Document (PRD). The PRD defines the specific test standards and criteria that must be met by hardware manufacturers and software developers in order to receive qualification.


What are the criteria for interoperability?

Interoperability means plug and play operation with full compatibility among products from different manufacturers. Each manufacturer must send their products to a Bluetooth Qualification Test Facility, which performs interoperability tests under controlled conditions. Unplugfests are an informal forum to determine interoperability issues. Broadcom has been attending Unplugfests since they first started in 1999.


What is the significance of the name?

Bluetooth wireless technology is named after Harald Blåtand ("Bluetooth"), who was King of Denmark from 940 to 981. He was the son of Gorm the Old, the King of Denmark, and Thyra Danebod, daughter of King Ethelred of England. Harald was responsible for peacefully uniting Denmark and Norway. Bluetooth wireless technology unites devices such as PDAs, cellular phones, PCs, headphones, and audio equipment, using short-range, low-power, low-cost radio technology.

Overview





















The ASSR-601J is a high-voltage solid state relay that is designed for high-voltage industrial applications. The ASSR-601J consists of an AlGaAs infrared light-emitting diode (LED) input stage optically coupled to a high-voltage output detector circuit. The detector consists of a high-speed photovoltaic diode array and driver circuitry to switch on/off two discrete high voltage MOSFETs. The relay turns on (contact closes) with a minimum input current of 10mA through the input LED. The relay turns off (contact opens) with an input voltage of 0.4V or less.

The ASSR-601J is equivalent to 1 Form A Electromechanical Relays (EMR) and is available in 16-pin SOIC package.

Leveraging Broadcom’s galvanic isolation optocoupler technology, the ASSR-601J  provides reinforced insulation and reliability that delivers safe signal isolation critical in high temperature industrial applications.

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom, Brocade merger delayed
Brocade Communications Systems Inc.  said late Tuesday the closing of its deal with Broadcom Ltd.  has been delayed to give a U.S. government inter-agency committee more time to go over the proposed deal. Broadcom agreed to buy Brocade last year, and shareholders approved the deal in January. Earlier this week, however, following discussions with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, the companies agreed to withdraw and re-file a voluntary notice to the committee to allow more time for a review. Once the committee accepts the notice, a new 30-day review period will start, and that may be followed by a 45-day investigation period, Brocade said. Shares of Brocade rose 0.2% in late trading and ended the day down 0.5%; shares of Broadcom rose 0.5% in the late session and ended the regular session up 0.8%. "Brocade and Broadcom have been and will continue to be actively engaged with CFIUS during its review of the proposed acquisition. There can be no assurances, however, that CFIUS will ultimately agree that the parties may proceed with the proposed acquisition," they said. The delay also affects Extreme Networks Inc. , which had agreed to buy Brocade's data-center networking business from Broadcom. Extreme said in a statement it expects to close its transaction with Broadcom within two to three business days of the completed acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom.

Broadcom, Brocade merger delayed
Brocade Communications Systems Inc.  said late Tuesday the closing of its deal with Broadcom Ltd.  has been delayed to give a U.S. government inter-agency committee more time to go over the proposed deal. Broadcom agreed to buy Brocade last year, and shareholders approved the deal in January. Earlier this week, however, following discussions with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, the companies agreed to withdraw and re-file a voluntary notice to the committee to allow more time for a review. Once the committee accepts the notice, a new 30-day review period will start, and that may be followed by a 45-day investigation period, Brocade said. Shares of Brocade rose 0.2% in late trading and ended the day down 0.5%; shares of Broadcom rose 0.5% in the late session and ended the regular session up 0.8%. "Brocade and Broadcom have been and will continue to be actively engaged with CFIUS during its review of the proposed acquisition. There can be no assurances, however, that CFIUS will ultimately agree that the parties may proceed with the proposed acquisition," they said. The delay also affects Extreme Networks Inc. , which had agreed to buy Brocade's data-center networking business from Broadcom. Extreme said in a statement it expects to close its transaction with Broadcom within two to three business days of the completed acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom.

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies in 2016 and currently[update] operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity called Broadcom Limited. The division is headquartered in Irvine, California. Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California.[1] In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and now employs approximately 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.
Broadcom is among Gartner's Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue.[2] Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009. In 2012, Broadcom's total revenue was $8.01 billion. In 2013, Broadcom stood at No. 327 on the Fortune 500, having climbed 17 places from its 2012 ranking of No. 344.[3]
In May 28, 2015 chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016,[4] Broadcom shareholders will hold 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, will be the new CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli will be Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company's board. and Dr. Nicholas will serve in a strategic advisory role within the new company.[5][6] The new merged entity is named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.
In May 2016 Cypress Semiconductor announced that it will acquire Broadcom Corporation's full portfolio of IoT products for $550 million. Under the deal, Cypress acquires Broadcom's IoT products and intellectual property for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee connectivity, as well as Broadcom's WICED platform and SDK for developers. The deal combines Broadcom's developer tools and connectivity technologies for IoT devices with Cypress' own programmable system-on-a-chip (SoC) products that provide memory, computing, and graphics processing for low-power devices.[7]

Products[edit]




Broadcom produces the system on a chip for the line of popular Raspberry Pi single-board computers.


Broadcom's product line spans computer and telecommunication networking: the company has products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for SOHO (small-office, home-office) networks. Products include transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL), servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for a series of high-speed encryption co-processors, offloading this processor-intensive work to a dedicated chip, thus greatly speeding up tasks that utilize encryption. This has many practical benefits for e-commerce, and PGP or GPG secure communications.
The company also produces ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. Major customers include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, IBM, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Linksys, Logitech, Nintendo, Nokia Siemens Networks, Nortel(Avaya), TiVo, Tenda, and Cisco Systems. In September 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations.[8] Broadcom also shut down its Blu-ray chip business. The closure of these businesses began on September 19, 2011.
On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.[9]
NICs and networking[edit]
Vendors have included Broadcom NICs in their products. For example, the Dell blade-server M610 has two embedded Gigabit NetXtreme 5709 NICs.[10]
Trident+ ASIC[edit]
Another large market is hardware for switches: some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors do use the Broadcom hardware but write their own firmware. The latest Broadcom Trident+ ASIC is used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from the largest switch-vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS,[11] Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS,[12][13] all Arista 7050-series switches,[14] the IBM/BNT 8264, and Juniper QFX3500.[15]
The latest 'member' of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports (or a mix of both) on a single chip.[16][17] Examples of switches using this Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000,[18] Cisco Nexus 9000[19] and some smaller vendors like: EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL or QuantaMesh T5032[20]
Graphics processing unit[edit]
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chip (SoC)s by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835 containing VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.
Video acceleration[edit]
Broadcom Crystal HD does video acceleration.
WiFi chipsets[edit]
Broadcom "BCM43" series chips provide WiFi support in many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are SoC devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer.[21] The chips also handle Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC.[22]

Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for Apple iPhone 3GS and later generations and corresponding iPod touch generations.
In Q2 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip” as deployed in millions of notebooks and PDAs across the globe, enabling Nintendo 802.11b connectivity with DS and 802.11g for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii's controller.[citation needed]
In 2013 Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SOCs which is adopted across many mobile phones including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei and Belkin also include Broadcom's 802.11ac chips.

Vulnerabilities[edit]
In April 2017, Google's Project Zero investigated Broadcom's SoC WiFi stack and found that it lacked "all basic exploit mitigations - including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection," allowing "full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."[23] Numerous smartphones, such as by Apple, Samsung and Google were affected.[24][25][26]

Broadcom and Linux[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips Broadcom produces.[28] Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel some Broadcom chips have kernel support but require external firmware to be built.
In 2003 the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making that code public.
The chipset was adopted by Linksys which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published source code for the firmware for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL-license.[29][30]
In 2012 the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the Top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation's Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel.[31] In October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it "the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers", although this claim has not been universally accepted.[32][33]
Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, and they also hired Eric Anholt, a former Intel employee, to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.
Manufacturing[edit]
Broadcom is known as a fabless company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to Asian merchant foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation. The company is based in Irvine, California, in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus, after a 2007 move from its previous campus near the Irvine Spectrum. It has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada, and Sophia Antipolis in France.
Stock options scandal[edit]
On July 14, 2006, Broadcom announced it had to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the amount was doubled to $1.5 billion. The company may also owe additional taxes.[34] On January 24, 2007, it announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 that totaled $2.22 billion.[35]
On May 15, 2008, Broadcom CTO Samueli resigned as chairman of the board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws.[36] However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.[37]
Qualcomm litigation and settlement[edit]
On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled four years of legal battles over wireless and other patents with Qualcomm Inc., another fabless semiconductor company headquartered in San Diego, California.[38]
The deal ended the patent litigation as well as complaints of anti-competitive behavior before trade commissions in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.[39]
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They found that these Qualcomm microchips infringe patents owned by Broadcom.
BroadVoice[edit]
For other uses, see BroadVoice.
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with LGPL license in 2009:[40]

BroadVoice 16 with declared bitrate 16 kbit/s and audio sampling frequency 8 kHz
BroadVoice 32 with declared bitrate 32 kbit/s and sampling rate of 16 kHz (note however that X-Lite SIP phone's menu declares bitrate 80,000 bit/s)

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.[41]
Besides the NetLogic Microsystems acquisition, through the years, Broadcom has acquired many smaller companies to quickly enter new markets.[42]

Branding[edit]
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company's previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas' then-wife Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.[citation needed]
Raspberry Pi[edit]
Broadcom organizes the fabrication of the processor chip, most recently the BCM2837 chip and the wifi processor BCM43438, which is used by the charitable Raspberry Pi foundation.[58] The foundation requested help from Broadcom making the Raspberry Pi card, a motherboard which is free of DRM or corporate control of any kind, which can interact with hardware, and which can be bought and controlled by children.[citation needed]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
