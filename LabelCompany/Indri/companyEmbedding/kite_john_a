Our Science

One of the most exciting advances in cancer is an innovative approach that involves removing a patient’s immune cells, engineering those cells to identify cancer, then infusing those cells in the patient to kill cancer. We have long believed in the promise of engineering T cells to treat certain blood cancers and our singular focus is developing cell therapy.
See Our Research

Our Technology

We are developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. Our dual platform has the potential to change the paradigm of cancer therapy and address both hematological and solid tumor cancers.
Explore Our Technology

Our Pipeline

We have one of the leading pipelines in cell therapy within the industry. Our CAR pipeline currently includes our lead investigational therapy that has the potential to become a franchise and address a range of blood cancers, and next generation technologies.  Our TCR pipeline includes investigational therapies that have the potential to address a range of solid tumors.

Kite Pharma: History In The Making? - Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Kite Pharma: History In The Making?Mar.13.17 | About: Kite Pharma (KITE) Value and Risk Long only, value, long-term horizon, GrowthSummaryKITE right now is flying very high in the hopes of a market launch of its CAR-T therapy in 2017 or becoming an acquisition target.Study results seem promising now, but hopes for CAR-T have been crushed in the past.While its lead candidate certainly is an extremely interesting product, the stock for now remains highly speculative. Introduction Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE), right now, is one of the hottest names in the biotech sector, and more specifically, the field of cancer immunotherapies. In simple words, KITE is trying to help the patient's immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. The very core idea of this method is significantly different from other cancer treatments like surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Lately, there has been much enthusiasm about KITE and its CAR-T therapy, after new results of the latest clinical trial were made public on February 28th. The stock is now up more than 47 percent, compared to the days before the results were released. Arie S. Belldegrun, the CEO of KITE, certainly did not even attempt to slow down the enthusiasm by calling the CAR-T program literally "one of the biggest breakthroughs in cancer therapy since the introduction of combination chemotherapy more than 60 years ago." If that is so, shouldn't every investor jump on the bandwagon as soon as they can? This article attempts to have a closer look on what the treatment does, who are the competitors, and what are other risks which could hurt KITE's plans to launch the treatment in 2017. So, what's all the fuzz about? First of all, what exactly does CAR-T therapy actually mean? The CAR stands for chimeric antigen receptor and the T for T cells. As described above, KITE is trying to harness the power of the patient's own immune system. Its lead product candidate, on which basically all hope in the company is pinned, is called axicabtagene ciloleucel. Now, in describing what the treatment does, allow me to first rely on KITE's own words:    "… patient's T cells are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor - CAR - to target the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, and redirect the T cells to kill cancer cells." Source: KITE press release February 28th, 2017  The T cells of the patient are modified to target cancer cells by "adding" a CAR to the T cells, which then binds to a protein that is specific to cells of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. While the trial, which created the recent buzz around the company, was conducted with 101 patients who suffered from different types of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma), KITE - according to the pipeline section of its website - is conducting similar trials for a number of other indications, which include (but are not limited to) chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. So basically, the enthusiasm around the recent data is not only grounded in a new way to fight specifically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but also in the hope to fight a whole number of different types of cancer with this immunotherapy approach - an approach, which created high hopes and much disappointment in the past, e.g. at the end of last year, when the competitor JUNO had to stop its trial after patient deaths. In medical terms, the death of a patient due to a therapy is called a grade 5 AE (adverse event). In KITE's trial, three patients died and two of those deaths were deemed to be related to the treatment. As this was already known since summer 2016 and no additional deaths occurred between then and the report of the new results at the end of February, the focus of investors and analysts for now, naturally, went to the "no additional deaths" part of the news. Of course, also, response rates for the treatment looked very impressive in the primary analysis. 82% percent of the patients showed a partial or complete response after only one infusion:    "The study met the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR), or rates of tumor response (complete response + partial response) recorded after a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, with 82 percent (p < 0.0001)." Source: KITE press release February 28th, 2017  In fact, 36% percent of the 101 patients achieved a complete response after 6 months and a single infusion, a fact that was communicated with much enthusiasm by KITE:    "These results with axicabtagene ciloleucel are exceptional and suggest that more than a third of patients with refractory aggressive NHL could potentially be cured after a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel." Source: KITE press release February 28th, 2017  Primarily, this now gives hope to patients, for whom every other treatment failed. The prospect of treating (or even curing) the disease with a single infusion truly sounds astonishing. Please note that I am not a medical professional and there are certainly much, much better places to learn more about how the treatment works in detail (another Seeking Alpha contributor recently pointed to an interesting video, which explains the treatment somewhat understandable for the layman), but the numbers for now do not look too bad. Everything so far sounds quite promising. But of course, an investor never should get too excited about a company. So let's continue to what might still be in the way for KITE's "biggest breakthrough since (…) more than 60 years ago". Competition and other barriers For quite some time, Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ:JUNO) has been viewed as a main competitor of KITE in the race to bring CAR-T to the market. That argument suffered a major blow when JUNO's trial was put on hold after patient deaths last year - after it also showed promising results. In general, what remains true is that KITE certainly is not alone in the CAR-T field. While they might be quicker to the market than JUNO, competition might enter the market sooner than KITE hopes. Also, JUNO's recent setback illustrates how quickly one can go "from hero to zero" in this field. After all, 101 patients (in KITE's study) still is not a very large number. Next to KITE and JUNO, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) is also staying in the CAR-T field. While they might have been a little bit late to the game, they potentially have vast resources at their disposal to compete with the two much smaller biotech companies. Competition therefore remains fierce and Kite surely cannot rely on being the sole provider of CAR-T treatments, if the treatment hits the market. Another risk on KITE's way to the market lies within a patent dispute with JUNO. More specifically, the patent in question is U.S. Patent No. 7,446,190, which is licensed by JUNO and protects CAR products containing a CD28 sequence, something which also has been employed by KITE in its anti-CD19 product (formerly known as KTE-C19 and now known as axicabtagene ciloleucel or - registered as a trademark in 2016 - AXI-CEL™). For now, KITE of course remains rather optimistic in public:    "However, Kite continues to believe the patent to be invalid and plans to appeal the USPTO decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This patent does not have any counterpart patents outside of the United States. The USPTO's decision will have no impact on the timing of the rolling submission or review of the Biologics License Application for Kite's lead product candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel" Source: KITE press release Dec. 19th, 2016  So, while KITE still regards the patent in question as invalid and it is only protecting the CD28 sequence in the U.S., a significant legal risk remains. In fact, JUNO is now suing KITE, which might make life even more difficult in the future:    "Juno is suing Kite seeking a declaratory judgement that Kite's lead product candidate KTE-C19 will infringe on '109 when commercially produced." Source: Seeking Alpha, Dec 19th, 2016  Also, not everybody in the pharma/biotech sector is really enthusiastic about the kind of bespoke CAR-T therapies, which KITE is offering. John F. Milligan, CEO of Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), for example, was rather skeptical about the new approach.    "It's a very labor-intensive kind of business (…) Those programs are projected to be quite expensive and are more akin to a bone marrow transplant, with a lot of supportive care and hospitalization costs, and those are the sorts of things that make me nervous." John F. Milligan, Source: Bloomberg Interview  Milligan, as someone who has been looking intensively to make an acquisition in biotech and even more specifically in oncology, certainly had put a fair amount of thought before making the statement above. Basically he's saying that the treatment potentially isn't very economic because of the high costs. While it is true that this kind of individualized therapy "sounds" more expensive for the provider than conventional therapies, nobody really knows what will be the price if (or when?) KITE launches it on the market. Also, so far, KITE cannot stress enough that the responses in the trial occurred after one single infusion of the engineered T cells. While cancer most likely never - or at least not in the near future - will be treated or even cured quickly, CAR-T could be somewhat of a game-changer when it comes to the duration of the treatment. But it will take more time, and more importantly, more data to really assess that. After all, the recent study showed great results and a study with 101 certainly is not negligible, but unfortunately, axicabtagene ciloleucel wouldn't be the first "next big thing" that failed after initially promising results. Last but not least, at this point - as already mentioned above - everything that is said about the pricing of the new therapy is wildly speculative. In a recent CNBC interview, Arie Belldegrun - of course - indicated that a true breakthrough should come with a fair price (and he meant it from the provider's point of view) and should be differentiated from a hypothetical new drug, which is just "a little bit better" than the existing ones. But for now, we can only work with uncertain assumptions. Launch Naturally, KITE can't wait to bring its lead product to the market. In the same press release, where the new study results have been disclosed, KITE could not resist to mention that the therapy is developed under breakthrough status of the FDA and therefore might be marketable sooner than some expect.    "Axicabtagene ciloleucel has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation status for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL), and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Priority Medicines (PRIME) regulatory support for DLBCL in the EU." Source: KITE press release February 28th 2017  So, for the sake of argument, let's assume all goes well and the treatment hits the market in 2017, as KITE hopes. It would certainly create a major hype around the company and the stock price would most likely rise even further. KITE has already opened a 43,500-square-foot plant near LAX Airport. The facility should enable the company, according to its own statements, to treat 4,000 to 5,000 patients per year. The patients, of course, would not have to travel to California for treatment. KITE is partnering with Vitruvian Networks, Inc. for a software solution. This is a platform which will connect KITE, hospitals, which offer the treatment (treatment centers), physicians, and patients. The goal of the platform is to streamline the logistics that come with the process of providing patients with the engineered T cells. KITE estimates that the "vein to vein" time would be approximately 16 to 18 days, this includes apheresis, manufacturing, the transportation processes and infusion. I stated above that pricing at this point remains wildly speculative. Therefore, I cannot stress enough that the next couple of sentences come with a wide margin of uncertainty. If we look at how aggressive NHL is treated now, KITE's therapy would probably be priced in the six-figures, which might cause some political pressure at the beginning (remember Gilead's HCV pricing?), because marketing a "one infusion treatment" with a price greater than $100,000 might raise a few eyebrows at first. This will depend on how good KITE will be at selling the CAR-T treatment as a major breakthrough that truly is different from anything else. If we would assume an initial low six figure price that would most likely bring us to revenue in the hundreds of millions, but not billions, with 4,000 to 5,000 patients per year. But KITE is thinking even bigger. According to a presentation of CEO Arie Belldegrun, the facility near LAX airport is scalable due to its modular design. Also, partnerships for commercialization of the treatment were already initiated with Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in China and Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. in Japan - big potential markets, which would not even be affected by the before mentioned patent issue. Therefore, if everything would go well (and that is a big "if!"), revenue could be estimated to go up to multiple billions, depending on how quickly the company would be able to expand capacities, and KITE's current market cap of around 4.6 billion (it's a volatile stock) would most likely go up to double-digit billions (if nobody would acquire it before then). Again, this whole section has been extremely speculative. The point is to illustrate that even though the stock has risen quite significantly over the past days and weeks, there still is enormous upside potential for KITE. Conclusion While enthusiasm, right now, is high, more clinical data for the treatment is still needed. At this point, it is still not safe to say that the CAR-T treatment will get to the market soon (or even at all). Pricing of the treatment is still very much uncertain. As stated before, the process is most likely very expensive for the provider of the treatment. Personally, however, I consider this only a minor risk, because a true breakthrough in cancer treatment most likely would not fail because people wouldn't pay for it. Also, the above-mentioned patent issue remains unresolved. This creates another risk, which should be considered before buying the stock. Personally, I am long KITE. I am well aware of the risks, which surround the company, but clinical data looks really promising and I regard the whole concept of the CAR-T technology basically as already proven. In my opinion, it is more a matter of WHEN (not IF) the technology hits the market and WHO becomes the market leader. KITE is well positioned for a potential launch even in 2017. Of course, nobody knows how future clinical data will look. But given the recent results, KITE for now might just be one step ahead of its competitors. At the end of the day, KITE - like many (if not all) biotech companies - still provides the potential investor with both a substantial upside potential, but also a very considerable amount of risk. If Arie Belldegrun stands correct, KITE's new product might just be a blessing for shareholders - but much more importantly, for patients too. Please note, that I am new to Seeking Alpha and this is my first contribution. Therefore, any feedback is highly appreciated.

Product Description

Designed by our old friend John Barresi in collaboration with ITW, the Kymera blends old and new school elements to produce both trick and precision ability in a wide wind range. Graceful side slides, jacobs ladders, spin landings to wap-do-waps, this is a true all-rounder fit for a fun day at the beach or serious competition. Built to drive and track with sharp, stable cornering when loaded up with a good wind, the Kymera is a great kite for tight banking turns and arcs with small powerful inputs, backed up by its smooth style throughout a wide range of tricks. Icarex polyester with Sky Shark carbon spars. 7’-2” x 3’-2”. 11.1-oz. 58/36” case. Includes a fixed 15-gram weight on the spine and another one on the tail, plus two 5-gram tail weights to use in any combination that you choose. Use 90-lb. Spectra line. Please specify Lime, Blue or Red color. 
 
Features:

Carbon frame flies easily in lighter winds.
Fast and quick-turning for extra excitement in stronger winds.
Icarex Polyester cloth.
Premium SkyShark carbon fram.
Solid pull provides excellent feedback.
25 Grams of tail weights for advanced trick flying.
Deluxe Travel Case.

TOM'S NOTES:As a young man John Barresi purchased his first dual-line from our Berkeley Marina location in 1990. it wasn't long before he had learned all we could teach him. Then, true to his nature, he began to share his growing kite knowledge with anyone who needed help. Flash forward more than two decades and now John is our webmaster, founder of Team iQuad and all-around mulit-line kite guru. We are excited to share John's first kite design with you and it is especially fun knowing that John's life in kitting began with us right here in Berkeley more than 20 years ago. We hope you enjoy your new Kymera and perhaps even a little more so, now that you know the "Rest of the Story".

Dual Line Tutorial - Assembly and Disassembly (stunt kite) (12:06)
Another in an ongoing series of Kitelife Magazine tutorials for using dual line sport / stunt kites, this one detailing an efficient and reliable assembly and disassembly method. While putting your kite together and taking it apart may not be relevant to your flying, it DOES effect not only the longevity of the kite and its materials, but a proven process can greatly streamline and simplify your "before and after" on the field. You can look forward to a growing collection of similar tutorials covering equipment, flight techniques and other "pro secrets" gathered from over 20 years in the kiting community... A number of them will be available here on YouTube, while the majority of these tutorials will be located in the Kitelife Subscribers section, be sure to subscribe today if you like what we're doing here!
