Threaded inserts are available   in a wide variety of problem-solving configurations to ease assembly   processes.
They are designed to provide   load-bearing threads in areas where access is only available from one   side and the parent material is light-gauge.
The product was designed to   have a tubular body with interior threads which, when inserted into   a prepared hole, can be compressed/collapsed/imbedded to allow the attachment   of an externally threaded fastener to complete an assembly.
Threaded inserts are available   in a variety of shapes to support many assembly challenges:  

Blind Rivet Nuts  are an invaluable method of attaching components to materials too thin     to be tapped and threaded. They are available in a wide variety of configurations     for specific problem solving; from large-flange heads to flush countersunk     and low-profile varieties. Anti-rotational designs can ensure the integrity     of the attachment and provide non-rotational assurance.


Installation is achieved   by using a variety of tooling, manual and powered, which properly and   speedily integrates the fastener into the assembly consistently. 


Key-locking inserts are useful in situations in which an existing thread has become stripped.      The keys in these inserts cut into the original threads and then lock     into place.  
Molded inserts  are designed to be placed in a mold cavity before the forming of a plastic     component.  
Knife-thread     and hexdrive inserts are effective solutions for use with most kinds     of wood.  
Press inserts are another useful means of adding threads to plastic parts.  
Self-tapping     threaded inserts can be used with a variety of materials, including     metal.  These inserts cut their own threads as they are placed     in the work-piece.

Placing of threaded inserts   typically requires specific tools.  Among the most prevalent are   heat insert drivers and power drivers.  Careful evaluation of a   threaded insert is important before installation, to provide for long-lasting   effectiveness.

Save Energy, Protect the Environment, Reduce Costs, Up to 18-SEER/Up to 96% Efficient! Crawford Company offers money saving, energy-efficient products from Bryant Heating and Cooling.
 

 

            Today, protecting the environment is among the top priorities for the government, many consumers, and many companies. That's why at Bryant, we're leading the way using over 100 years of experience to develop heating and cooling products that meet our customers' environmental concerns, as well as government requirements. If you're as concerned about protecting the environment as much as we are at Bryant, take a moment to learn more about the ways you can make a difference with your hard-working Bryant heating and cooling system.

Energy Efficient Products
One of the best ways to protect the environment is to purchase energy efficient products that require fewer energy resources to operate. Not only will you make a difference to the environment, you'll also save on operating costs. Make sure your heating and cooling products have high energy efficiency ratings such as SEER and AFUE.
Energy Star Program
Energy Star promotes energy efficiency among residential appliances, because household appliances have the potential to contribute a great deal to air pollution. Energy Star promotes energy efficient furnaces, heat pumps and air conditioners, and thermostats, among other products. 
Puron Refrigerant
Environmentally sound, chlorine-free Pruton Refrigerant is the refrigerant of the future. Developed to replace R-22refrigerant, Puron Refrigerant is not only environmentally sound, but is also more efficient. In fact, Bryant was among the first heating and cooling manufacturers to use a non-ozone-depleting refrigerant, such as Puron Refrigerant.

About Us

> About Us
 

Crawford Products is…
… your industry leader in painter’s putty.

Crawford Products was founded in 1956 by Harry G. Crawford and Gertrude J. Crawford. Harry, who was a professional painter, claimed he couldn’t find a painter’s putty to his liking. So he started making his own right on the job site!
As time passed, Harry became more and more confident that his home-made putty had potential as a marketable item. Harry purchased a small piece of industrial property in Southern California plus one small milling machine and began manufacturing painter’s putty in small batches. Gertrude did all the labeling and book work. In order to drum up consumer interest, Harry gave away more putty than he sold. His ongoing painting business helped pay the bills.
After several lean years and many disappointments, his putty gained some modest recognition from local painters. As these painters demanded more, local retailers were forced to stock the product. These small successes enabled Harry to take on his second goal, that of formulating an asbestos-free, easy sanding interior/exterior spackling paste. After seven years of tedious research and development, Crawford’s Vinyl Spackling Paste took off in a big way.
Operated by second and third generations of the Crawford family.  Debi Crawford is the President of Crawford Products. Mark Crawford is third generation and acts as corporate pilot as well as VP of Crawford Products and over sees day to day operations.
Crawford’s boasts sales either direct or through distribution into all fifty states plus the Virgin Islands. Professional end users can obtain Crawford’s Natural Blend Painter’s Putty and Crawford’s Free Spackling Paste at independent paint and decorating stores, regional and national manufacturer-owned paint stores and at selected DIY centers, hardware stores and lumber yards. (Please refer to our continually updated dealer/distributor listings).
Dealers of all sizes can purchase nationally or locally through an array of service-oriented paint sundry distributors located throughout the United States. Dealers who wish to purchase factory direct may do so provided certain conditions are met.
