Private Equity Program Fund Performance Review

As of September 30, 2016, the since inception Net IRR is 10.7% and the Net Multiple is 1.4x.
The table below reflects the performance of all active PE partnership investments as of September 30, 2016. At the end of each quarter, the General Partners report on the value of invested capital. The General Partners have 120 days to provide Limited Partners with financial data, so there is generally a 2-quarter delay in performance reporting.



  How to Read the Performance Review Table  



The table is updated quarterly and provides information on the status of all active CalPERS private equity commitments; it doesn't include any exited partnership investments.

The Fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments.
Vintage Year is the year in which CalPERS’ first cash flow for the investment occurred.
Capital Committed identifies the original amount CalPERS committed to each fund.
Cash In represents capital contributed for investments and management fees.
Cash Out represents distributions CalPERS has received back from the fund.
Cash Out & Remaining Value represents the distributions CalPERS has received plus the reported value of the invested capital.
Net IRR is the Net Internal Rate of Return based on CalPERS’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital.
Investment Multiple is the Cash Out & Remaining Value divided by the Cash In.

In evaluating private equity performance, CalPERS emphasizes using both the realized Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Investment Multiple. Interim IRRs by themselves are not the best indicators of current or future fund performance.
The IRR is calculated based on CalPERS records of cash flows and financial statements from the investment managers.

1Not Meaningful: Funds with a vintage year of 2012 or later are in the initial stages of their investment life cycle. Any performance analysis done on these funds would not generate meaningful results as private equity funds are understood to be long-term investments.
2Partnership investment is using a cash adjusted market value.

Overview

Asset classes are a result of a period strategic asset allocation process and approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration.
CalPERS' investment portfolio is diversified into several asset classes.
Strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return; a well-diversified portfolio shapes our long-term performance, protects the Retirement Fund, and ensures any weaknesses in one area are offset by gains in another.

			FINANCIAL PLANNING		






Before we even begin to develop a plan we always begin with a discovery process of what your exact financial goal is. After all, how can you arrive at your destination if you don’t even know where you’re headed? Unlike traditional models, we don’t cram you into a category based on age, asset level, annual income, or an arbitrary risk tolerance that a computer program determined for you. We choose to take a more holistic approach that takes into account the economy around you as well as your individual feeling toward risk and volatility. After all, you are not simply a number and shouldn’t be treated as such.
As a part of the financial planning process we will discover which of the following areas deserves the most attention:



Commitment to Savings
College Savings


Income Planning
Debt Management


Tax Planning
Risk Management


Efficient utilization of Assets
Retirement Planning


Proper Diversification
Small Business Ownership


Insurance Analysis
Estate and Succession Planning



Once we identify your goals and develop a plan to achieve your objectives, we’ll implement the overall strategy with, but not limited to the following investment options at our disposal:



Stocks
Life Insurance


ETF’s
Venture Capital Investments


Trusts
Mutual Funds


Real Estate
401(k)


Bonds
Limited Partnerships


Traditional and Roth IRA’s
Alternative Assets

Understanding the short-term and long-term effects of dividing property. Analyzing pensions and retirement plans. Determining if the client can afford the marital home, and if not, what he or she can afford. Recognizing the tax consequences of different settlement proposals.
Data Collection and Analysis

Managing Partner’s Message












In a rapidly changing world, we all need robust financial guidance and management more than ever in order to properly navigate an often confusing and volatile investment landscape. We believe that while the markets and technology seem to morph into something new on a daily basis, the fundamental principles that build a proper foundation for investing do not. Hence our motto: “Traditional Values, for a New Financial World.”
The last thirteen years have been an enormously difficult and trying stretch of time for this country and everyone in it. Starting with the dot-com bust that began in March of 2000, a seemingly endless barrage of events soon followed that continues to test our resolve to this day. In the wake of 9/11, the housing market collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the credit crisis, the European debt crisis, and the threat of further terrorist attacks, investor anxiety has hit an all time high and deservedly so. However, in the face of such adversity we can all still choose to take control of our lives, stop living in fear of an uncertain future, and move forward with the confidence and belief that any realistic financial goal can be reached.
My personal pledge is to ensure that every single thing we do as a company is geared toward helping our clients achieve their unique financial objectives. Period.
In a world that largely pays lip-service to such a principle, we remain committed to this sentiment as the bedrock of how we conduct our business. At VII Capital you are our first priority and you always will be.











Sincerely,















Peter C. Kyriakoulis
Founder and Managing Partner








Company Mission












The VII Capital Group’s mission is to provide our clients with an unparalleled level of service and performance that cannot be found at a traditional Wall Street firm. We accomplish this by adhering to a strict code of ethics, by implementing proprietary risk management techniques, by following a systematic disciplined investment process, and by ensuring that our fee structure never separates our interests from those of our clients.
