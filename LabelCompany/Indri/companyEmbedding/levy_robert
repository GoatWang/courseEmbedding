Curriculum Vitae
Biography

											Brief Bio
										
Dr. Robert Levy has been a Research Physical Scientist in the Climate and Radiation Laboratory (CRL) since 2013. Dr. Levy is focused on retrieving global aerosol properties from satellite observations, and using the retrieved products for quantifying the role of aerosols in climate and air quality.  He is responsible for maintaining the "dark-target" aerosol retrieval for MODIS, and applying it to VIIRS and other sensors to create a long-term global aerosol record. Dr. Levy’s research has ranged from applications of new algorithm development, monitoring surface air quality, aerosol/cloud interactions and aerosol trends.  His publication list and citation metrics can be found at ResearcherID.   

											Current Projects
										


													Fine tuning the MODIS dark target aerosol algorithm and products: comprehensive error analysis
												
												I am PI of this Terra/Aqua-Existing Data Products proposal.  The goal is to maintain and continue to improve the MODIS dark-target aerosol product. Primary tasks include developing a per-pixel retrieval uncertainty product, removing retrieval bias over urban areas, and moving towards greater data fusion with other satellite datasets and models. 




													Towards a consistent aerosol data record, created from MODIS, VIIRS and beyond
												
												I am PI of this project as part of the Suomi-NPP Science Team.  The goal is to apply the MODIS dark-target aerosol retrieval algorithm to VIIRS in order to create a continuous aerosol data record.  




													Studying aerosol in cloud fields using MAS data from SEAC4RS and previous field campaigns
												
												I am PI of this NASA-funded opportunity for Atmospheric Composition Campaign Data Analysis and Modeling.  We are porting the MODIS aerosol dark-target algorithm to use airborne eMAS observations.  Starting with the recent SEAC4RS experiment, we are looking to characterize aerosol in cloud fields at high resolution. 




													Study of aerosol properties in the vicinity of clouds using multiplatform and multisensor data fusion
												
												I am Co-I on this NASA-funded project aimed at enhancing The Science of Terra and Aqua. Our work will be characterize and correct for 3D radiative effects within the MODIS dark-target aerosol retrieval algorithm

										Brief Bio
									
Dr. Robert Levy has been a Research Physical Scientist in the Climate and Radiation Laboratory (CRL) since 2013. Dr. Levy is focused on retrieving global aerosol properties from satellite observations, and using the retrieved products for quantifying the role of aerosols in climate and air quality.  He is responsible for maintaining the "dark-target" aerosol retrieval for MODIS, and applying it to VIIRS and other sensors to create a long-term global aerosol record. Dr. Levy’s research has ranged from applications of new algorithm development, monitoring surface air quality, aerosol/cloud interactions and aerosol trends.  His publication list and citation metrics can be found at ResearcherID.

Robert I. Komitor

																			Partner 																		







A partner at Levy Konigsberg LLP Robert I. Komitor serves as lead trial lawyer specializing in products liability, negligence, and personal injury cases involving mesothelioma, hazardous wastes, and pollution. Bob was named one of the nation’s Best Lawyers, in the area of mass torts, in Gregory W. Smith and Steven W. Naifeh’s The Best Lawyers in America 2005-2010 (Woodward/White).
Bob has consistently won some of the highest damage awards in the nation. For three consecutive years, he made The National Law Journal’s list of lawyers winning the highest verdicts.
He was trial lawyer on the “New York Powerhouse” mesothelioma cases and the consolidated Brooklyn Navy Yard litigation, which resulted in the largest mesothelioma compensation awards in the country for 1991 and 1992, according to The National Law Journal.
In 1993, Bob served as co-trial lawyer with LK partner Moshe Maimon on a case that resulted in New York State’s largest mesothelioma compensation – one of the largest in the nation for that year. He repeated this feat by obtaining two of New York State’s highest compensatory verdicts for mesothelioma in 1996 and, again, in 2003.

Bob earned a Master’s Degree in Marine Environmental Sciences from Stony Brook University’s Marine Sciences Research Center. He earned a law degree from the Hofstra University School of Law, where he was an editor at the Hofstra Law Review.
Bob is a former member of the Products Liability Committee of the New York City Bar Association and has co-chaired the New York State Bar Association’s Civil Litigation Committee on Environmental Law. He has also served as chairman of the G-I Holding’s Bankruptcy Creditors’ Committee and serves on the Trust Advisory Committee on the Ray Tech and G-I Holding’s Trust.
An esteemed authority on trial practices and environmental and toxic tort law, Bob has lectured before many legal gatherings including the American Bar Association, the American Association of Trial Lawyers (ATLA), the American Conference Institute, Mealey’s Conferences, Perrin Conferences, Harris Martin Conferences, and HB Litigation Conferences. Moreover, he is the author of several educational articles about the legal aspects of cases involving exposure to toxic substances and unsafe products.






note: While our offices are located in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Georgia, many of our mesothelioma lawyers are licensed to practice law in a number of U.S. states and have the capability and extensive experience of representing mesothelioma clients throughout the United States. You are encouraged to contact us with any questions.
