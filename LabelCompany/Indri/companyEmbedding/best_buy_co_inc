Best Products (also known simply as BEST) was a chain of American catalog showroom retail stores founded by Sydney and Frances Lewis, formerly headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. It was founded in 1957 and went out of business in 1997. At the time it filed the second time for bankruptcy it had 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service. When in operation Best Products was traded on the NASDAQ exchange as "BESTQ".

History[edit]
The company was founded by Sydney Lewis and Frances Lewis. Sydney Lewis, a lawyer educated at Washington & Lee and Harvard Business School, worked with his father managing an encyclopedia sales operation in Richmond. Lewis thought of selling additional merchandise along with the bills for encyclopedias. In 1957, the Lewises sent out their first catalog. The first showroom was at 4909 West Marshall Street in Richmond, just across the street from the new Willow Lawn Shopping Center.
The company had a strong sense of promotion and artistic sensibilities; it was legend in artistic circles that it would trade store merchandise for art. As a result, the company, as well as the Lewises, gathered a significant collection of 20th-century art. Much of the Lewis Collection can be seen at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
Sculpture in the Environment[edit]
In the 1970s, Best Products contracted with James Wines’ "Sculpture in the Environment" (SITE) architecture firm to design nine highly unorthodox retail facilities, notably a tongue-in-cheek structure called the "Indeterminate Facade" in Houston, Texas with a severely distressed facade. This building purportedly “appeared in more books on 20th-century architecture than photographs of any other modern structure”.[1] In Richmond, the company built the Peeling Wall showroom that appeared to have a peeling facade (located on Midlothian Turnpike) as well as a Forest showroom that appeared to have trees growing out of it (located at 9008 Quioccasin Road). The store in Sacramento also had a unique design. In the morning, its corner entryway would slide open, and would slide back shut at night. The structure, with its breakaway entry removed, is now a Best Buy.[2] Photographs of these storefronts appeared in several Best catalogs. One anchored the Eudowood Plaza in Towson, Maryland, featuring a tilted front. As of 2007, most of these distinctive buildings have been converted into conventional buildings by removing the architectural embellishments, or in a few cases, demolished. The only building to retain its distinctive features is the Forest building in Richmond, now home to the West End Presbyterian Church, which has stated that the forest in the entryway has been an asset to the church's environment.
Their Parham Road headquarters, built in 1981 and designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, was notable for an American Institute of Architects award and the use of Art Deco eagles rescued from a New York building.[3] The giant BEST letters of the headquarters could be seen along Interstate 95 at Parham Road. Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer subsequently designed the West Wing of the Virginia Museum, which was funded by the Lewises.
Retail concept[edit]
Best employed the "catalog showroom" concept for many of its product offerings. Although some product categories (such as sporting goods and toys) were stocked in traditional self-serve aisles, the majority of products (notably consumer electronics, housewares, and appliances) were featured as unboxed display models. Customers were permitted to examine and experiment with these models, and if found to be desirable, they could be purchased by submitting orders to store personnel. Saleable versions of the merchandise (typically boxed and/or in its original packaging) would then be retrieved from storage and delivered to a customer service area for subsequent purchase.
Acquisitions[edit]
As a cost-saving measure, Best jointly published its catalog with Service Merchandise and Modern Merchandising, and had regional non-compete agreements with those chains.
In 1982, Best acquired catalog competitors: Basco, a chain with 19 catalog showrooms in the Northeast and Ohio; and Modern Merchandising, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota with 76 showrooms under the names LaBelle's, Dolgin's, Jafco, Miller Sales, Rogers and Great Western. This was followed by the acquisition of Ashby's, a 9-store women's clothing chain, and the opening of four Best Jewelry stores in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.[4]
Bankruptcy[edit]

Best filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The first bankruptcy period began in January 1991 and lasted through June 16, 1994. The second and final filing was made on September 24, 1996. At the time of the second filing, Best operated 169 Best stores and 11 Best Jewelry stores in 23 states, and a nationwide mail-order service.
Best Products was traded on the NASDAQ exchange as “BESTQ.” It was de-listed on November 29, 1996, and Best did not appeal the NASDAQ decision. The last Best stores closed on February 9, 1997.[5][6][7][8] By May 1997, Best had liquidated most of its assets and was declared insolvent. Best vacated its corporate headquarters in Richmond in January 1998 and mailed out final checks to unsecured creditors the following December (paying 96 cents per dollar owed).

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.
2010s

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

History
Early history
In August 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in Saint Paul, Minnesota.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family’s home.[19][21] In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company.[21] Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year.[19] In 1969, Schulze bought out his business partner. Sound of Music had three stores and became a publicly held company listed on the NASDAQ exchange.[19][22]
Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978.[23] In 1981, the Roseville, Minnesota, Sound of Music location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado.[19] The store’s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact.[19][24] In response, Schulze decided to have a “Tornado Sale” of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store’s parking lot.[19] He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising “best buys” on everything.[24] Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.[20]
In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc.[23][24] The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15-to-18-year-old males.[24] Later that year Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota.[24] The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze’s successful Tornado Sale in 1981.[19][24] In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.[20][21]
Best Buy debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987.[25][26] In 1989, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed “Concept II.”[21][25] Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores.[21] Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers.[25][26] Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople.[19][25] The commission-free sales environment “created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,” but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers.[25] Some suppliers, such as Maytag, Whirlpool and Sony, were upset that salespeople would no longer be pushing their products and stopped selling their wares in Best Buy stores.[19][20] The suppliers returned after Best Buy’s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.[24]
In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues.[26] In 1995, Best Buy debuted “Concept III” stores, which were larger than its previous stores.[26][27] The Concept III stores included expanded product offerings, interactive touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and videogames.[27][28]
Best Buy launched its “Concept IV” stores with its expansion into New England in 1998.[26][29] Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores.[30] The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.[26][31]
In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard & Poor’s S&P 500.[26]

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor.[32] The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington and Oregon, in December 2000.[26]
In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play and OnCue brands.[26][33] Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt.[26][33] Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace.[26][34] Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for approximately $377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.[35][36]
Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002.[37] Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school.[37] He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991.[37] In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California and San Francisco, California.[37]
Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2003.[39][40] In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland’s stock and debt.[41] Best Buy launched its “Reward Zone” loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California.[42] Also in 2003, Best Buy’s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.
In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy’s website and handle all of the company’s online content.[43] In May, the company launched its “customer centricty” program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles.[44] The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories.[44] In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad “precincts” in every American Best Buy store.[45]
In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.[46]
In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million.[47] At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces.[47] In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida.[42] The market test was later expanded to Denver Colorado.[48]
In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai, China.[49] In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle, Washington-based broadband VOIP, data and IT services provider.[50] The acquisition was worth $80 million and, under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy.[50] The company’s products also became part of Best Buy’s For Business program.[50] Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis, Indiana and Charlotte, North Carolina.[51] In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.[52]
In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[53] Best Buy’s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March.[54] Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba's decision to drop HD DVD.[55] In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer.[56][57] The deal was worth $2.1 billion.[57]
In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US.[58] Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple’s iPhone in September.[59] Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million.[60] In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.[61]
In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer.[62] Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns.[62] Best Buy Mobile were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.[62]
In June 2009, Brian Dunn became Best Buy CEO.[63] Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring.[63] Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate.[64] In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004.[64] He had most recently served as president of Best Buy, a position he had held since 2006.[64]
Best Buy partnered with Roxio's CinemaNow to launch an on-demand movie download service that would allow customers to stream content to any device sold by Best Buy that connected to the Internet in November 2009.[65] In December, the first Turkish Best Buy opened in İzmir.

In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock.[66] The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom.[67] The company closed all UK-based Best Buy stores in November 2011.[67] That same month Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse’s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion.[67] Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.[67]
The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China’s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009.[3][68] In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.[69]
In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a "transformation strategy". Stores began to adopt a redesigned "Connected Store" format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a "store-within-a-store" concept for Pacific Kitchen & Bath and Magnolia Design Center.[70]
In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy’s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee.[71] Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn’s resignation.[71] The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn’s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board.[71] Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company.[71] Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.[71]
Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO in September 2012.[72] Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008.[72]
In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer.[73][74] The sale was worth approximately $775 million.[73][74]
An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014 quarter, marked the tenth quarter in a row where Best Buy's sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital-media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.[75]
On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were shuttered permanently.[76]
On May 24, 2016, Best Buy announced Sharon McCollam would step down as Chief Financial Officer on June 14.[77]

Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, VHS cassettes and VCRs, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a non-commissioned sales environment.[3] Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans.[3]
The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure.[78] Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.[79][80]
As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US.[1][3] Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico.[3] Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013.[73][74]

Criticism
Warranty
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer's warranty in order to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had "entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties" and that the company used "artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the 'complete extended warranties' from making legitimate claims."[81] The company ultimately settled for $200,000 but admitted no wrongdoing.[82]
In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.[83]
Pricing
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company's use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices.[84] In December 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.[85]
Similar pricing errors occurred in July 2009, when the Palm Pre multimedia smartphone was mistakenly sold for $99.99 (versus the retail price of $199.99), and Best Buy honored some of the sales.[citation needed] Best Buy regularly exercises the right to cancel orders associated with errors on its website.[citation needed]
Analog televisions
In April 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009.[86] The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.[87]
Environmental issues
It was one of several large companies named by Greenpeace in 2007 for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that, in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.[88]
Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products as well as reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries, and empty ink cartridges.[89]
As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste and is available at all their stores for free. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company's goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.[90]
It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power –  electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass and low-impact hydropower.[91]

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

Sears to sell Kenmore brand on Amazon
Sears Holdings Corp. will start selling its Kenmore line of refrigerators and stoves on Amazon.com Inc.'s website, marking the first distribution of its kitchen appliances outside of its own stores. Sears's shares rose 15% to $10 in morning trading, bringing the stock into positive-trading territory this year.

Home Depot, Best Buy stocks suffer from Amazon effect
Home Depot Inc.'s stock  tumbled 4.2% in morning trade Thursday toward a three-month low, enough to be the Dow Jones Industrial Average's  biggest loser, in the wake of Sears Holdings Corp.'s  announcement that it will sell appliances through Amazon.com Inc. . Appliances have been among the best performing categories for Home Depot. The stock's selloff was the main reason for Dow's price decline. Shares of fellow home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies  shed 4.6% to a five-month low. Shares of Best Buy Co. Inc. , which has also benefited from strong appliance sales, slid 3.9%. Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp.  dropped 4.7%. Meanwhile, Sears's stock shot up 19%, while shares of fellow department store chain J.C. Penney Co. Inc.  gained 1.4%.

Retail stocks battered by Amazon-related fears
Shares of retailers were hammered Monday, as a wave of fears about the impact of juggernaut Amazon.com Inc.  on the sector were highlighted in stories and commentary from analysts. Department store chain Macy's Inc. , currently in the midst of store closures caused by weak revenue as shoppers switch to Amazon, led the decliners with a 7% fall, making it the worst performer on the S&P 500. Gap Inc.  fell 6.5%, followed by Best Buy Inc. , down 6.3%. Best Buy has mostly escaped the pressure of the Amazon effect, but was hit Monday by a Recode report that Amazon has been hiring a team of people to offer in-home product installations, competing with Best Buy's "Geek Squad." Kohl's Corp. fell 4.6% and Nordstrom Inc.  was down 2.7%. Abercrombie & Fitch  fell 20% after it said it had ended talks on a potential deal. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  was down 2.5% and Foot Locker Inc.  was down 2.3%. Costco Wholesale Corp.  fell 1.7% after an analyst downgrade that suggested the company's strong fundamentals are being overshadowed by Amazon fears, following its bid for Whole Foods Markets Inc. .  The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund  was down 2% and is now down 11.7% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Best Buy's stock tumbles to pace S&P 500 decliners amid concerns over Amazon effect
Shares of Best Buy Co. Inc.  tumbled 7.2% in active morning trade Monday, enough to pace the S&P 500 decliners, amid increasing concerns over competition from Amazon.com Inc. . The electronics retailer's stock had been relatively immune to the Amazon effect, as the stock has climbed 11% over the past three months and 27% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  had lost 7.7% over the past three months and 12% this year. But Recode reported Monday, citing "multiple sources," that Amazon has been hiring a number of people to offer free Alexa consultations and in-home product installations for a fee, which would compete with Best Buy's "Geek Squad" installation and repair service. The new services are currently available in seven West Coast cities, the Recode report said, and it appears a large expansion is in the works to some states including Florida, Texas and the New York area. Best Buy's stock volume topped 5.4 million shares within the first two hours after the open, already more than the full-day average of about 5.2 million shares. Amazon's stock rallied 1.4% in morning trade, and has rallied 9.4% over the past three months and 32% year to date.

Ebay launches price matching program
Ebay Inc.  said Wednesday that it has launched a price match guarantee on more than 50,000 items in the U.S. Merchandise found on Ebay Deals, which launched in 2011, is eligible. Shoppers don't have to be Ebay members to take advantage of the program. Ebay will match pricing from competitors including Amazon.com Inc. , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , and Best Buy Co. Inc. . Eighty percent of merchandise sold on Ebay is new, the company said. Ebay shares are up 0.4% in Wednesday premarket trading, and up 41.4% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 16.7% for the last 12 months.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
