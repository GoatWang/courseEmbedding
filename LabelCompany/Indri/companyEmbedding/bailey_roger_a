Item description, condition report, payment options and related products below
First edition, first print hardback of BREAM TALES AND TACTICS by John Bailey and Roger Miller and published by The Crowood Press Ltd., Wiltshire in 1988. Line   illustrations by Chris Turnbull. 
 The book is in very good condition (Clean blue cloth boards with gilt lettering on spine), with minor wear to the illustrated dust jacket which is not price clipped (light creasing to the edges). Internally,   the pages are clean and tight and there are no tears and no inscriptions. There is very slight yellowing to the pages. 
  John Bailey is an internationally renowned author, photographer and presenter of television programmes on angling and natural history. One of Britain's best-known anglers, he has written numerous books.   Roger Miller is a regular contributor to the angling press and has written a number of books in conjunction with John Bailey. 
 "In BREAM - Tales and Tactics they combine their own wide experience and knowledge of the species with the practical wisdom of a dozen other bream specialists - from match man to record holder. The   result is a comprehensive guide to angling for this popular and widely distributed fish. 
 From large water-supply reservoirs where a single fisherman might catch a dozen double-figure monsters in one 24-hour session, by way of difficult meres where a syndicate's total season's catch might amount   to no more than four bream, a Norfolk lake whose sole surviving specimen - the last of the 'magnificent seven' - broke the British record at 13lb 9oz 1dr, to the hard-fighting fish of small East Anglian   rivers, venues of every type are explored in all their detail. 
 Tackles and tactics, hookbaits and groundbaits, swims, patrol routes and locations are all fully described. But this is no mere 'how to do it' manual. The 'tales' of the title make it a book that the reader   will reach for as much for pleasure during the contemplative hours of the close season as for guidance on the eve of a breaming session after the off." 
 Contents includes chapters on: Techniques; Meres, Gravel Pits, Reservoirs, Estate Lakes, Rivers and The Contributors Who are John Bailey, Tony Bromley, Mike Davison, Paul Dennis, Graham Marsden, Tony Miles,   Roger Miller, Alastair Nicholson, Bill Rushmer, Phil Smith, Peter Stone, Chris Turnbull, Alan Wilson, and John Wilson. 
 144 pages. Illustrated with black & white and colour photographs and line drawings within the text.

Life, Animated is a 2016 American documentary by director Roger Ross Williams.[1] It is co-produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Life, Animated is based on journalist Ron Suskind's 2014 book Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism, which tells the story of his son, Owen Suskind who struggled with autism and learned how to communicate with the outside world through his love of Disney films from Owen's perspective (the book was from Ron's).[2]
Upon its release the film received rave reviews from critics and won numerous awards including the Sundance Film Festival award for Best Direction and the Special Achievement Annie Award. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature category at the 89th Academy Awards, but lost to O.J.: Made In America.[3][4][5]

Synopsis[edit]
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him.

Production[edit]
The animation is done by Mac Guff, which also worked on films such as Despicable Me and The Lorax.[6]. To secure the rights for the clips and characters used in the film, Williams showed the unfinished product to the heads of department put together by Disney Productions president Sean Bailey. Roger refers to it as "the day I made the lawyers cry" after the end of the presentation. The films selected for the film were "100% Suskind". [7]
Reception[edit]
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Life, Animated offers a heartwarming look at one family's journey, and a fascinating message that's more than enough to outweigh its unanswered questions."[8] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[9]
The Guardian's critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."[10] Kenneth Turan of LA Times lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is Life, Animated's greatest strength."[11] Writing for Variety, Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from Roger Ross Williams ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."[12] The Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."[13] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post positively reviewed the series and said, "Life, Animated makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"[14] Rolling Stone's chief film critic Peter Travers said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."[15]
Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."[16] Reviewing for RogerEbert.com film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."[17] Entertainment Weekly's, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."[18] Kyle Smith of New York Post explained, "Life, Animated oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."[19]
Some publications were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of Empire David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."[20] Film critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."[21] The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind’s 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."[22] In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."[23]
The film is highly praised by the autism community and Disney staff. [24] [25][26]
Land of the Lost Sidekicks[edit]
An exclusive short, based on Owen's fan fic featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016. [27]
Sidekicks used in the film:

Baloo from The Jungle Book (1967 film) [28]
Timon and Rafiki from The Lion King [29]
Iago and Abu from Aladdin (1992 film) [30]
Lucky Jack from Home on the Range (2004 film) [31]
Sebastian from The Little Mermaid (1989 film) [32]

Life, Animated is a 2016 American documentary by director Roger Ross Williams.[1] It is co-produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Life, Animated is based on journalist Ron Suskind's 2014 book Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism, which tells the story of his son, Owen Suskind who struggled with autism and learned how to communicate with the outside world through his love of Disney films from Owen's perspective (the book was from Ron's).[2]
Upon its release the film received rave reviews from critics and won numerous awards including the Sundance Film Festival award for Best Direction and the Special Achievement Annie Award. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature category at the 89th Academy Awards, but lost to O.J.: Made In America.[3][4][5]

Synopsis[edit]
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him.

Production[edit]
The animation is done by Mac Guff, which also worked on films such as Despicable Me and The Lorax.[6]. To secure the rights for the clips and characters used in the film, Williams showed the unfinished product to the heads of department put together by Disney Productions president Sean Bailey. Roger refers to it as "the day I made the lawyers cry" after the end of the presentation. The films selected for the film were "100% Suskind". [7]
Reception[edit]
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Life, Animated offers a heartwarming look at one family's journey, and a fascinating message that's more than enough to outweigh its unanswered questions."[8] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[9]
The Guardian's critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."[10] Kenneth Turan of LA Times lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is Life, Animated's greatest strength."[11] Writing for Variety, Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from Roger Ross Williams ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."[12] The Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."[13] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post positively reviewed the series and said, "Life, Animated makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"[14] Rolling Stone's chief film critic Peter Travers said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."[15]
Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."[16] Reviewing for RogerEbert.com film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."[17] Entertainment Weekly's, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."[18] Kyle Smith of New York Post explained, "Life, Animated oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."[19]
Some publications were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of Empire David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."[20] Film critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."[21] The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind’s 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."[22] In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."[23]
The film is highly praised by the autism community and Disney staff. [24] [25][26]
Land of the Lost Sidekicks[edit]
An exclusive short, based on Owen's fan fic featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016. [27]
Sidekicks used in the film:

Baloo from The Jungle Book (1967 film) [28]
Timon and Rafiki from The Lion King [29]
Iago and Abu from Aladdin (1992 film) [30]
Lucky Jack from Home on the Range (2004 film) [31]
Sebastian from The Little Mermaid (1989 film) [32]

In a lukewarm review of Empire David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."[20] Film critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."[21] The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind’s 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."[22] In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."[23]
The film is highly praised by the autism community and Disney staff. [24] [25][26]
Land of the Lost Sidekicks[edit]
An exclusive short, based on Owen's fan fic featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016. [27]

Life, Animated is a 2016 American documentary by director Roger Ross Williams.[1] It is co-produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Life, Animated is based on journalist Ron Suskind's 2014 book Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism, which tells the story of his son, Owen Suskind who struggled with autism and learned how to communicate with the outside world through his love of Disney films from Owen's perspective (the book was from Ron's).[2]
Upon its release the film received rave reviews from critics and won numerous awards including the Sundance Film Festival award for Best Direction and the Special Achievement Annie Award. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature category at the 89th Academy Awards, but lost to O.J.: Made In America.[3][4][5]

Synopsis[edit]
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him.

Production[edit]
The animation is done by Mac Guff, which also worked on films such as Despicable Me and The Lorax.[6]. To secure the rights for the clips and characters used in the film, Williams showed the unfinished product to the heads of department put together by Disney Productions president Sean Bailey. Roger refers to it as "the day I made the lawyers cry" after the end of the presentation. The films selected for the film were "100% Suskind". [7]
Reception[edit]
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Life, Animated offers a heartwarming look at one family's journey, and a fascinating message that's more than enough to outweigh its unanswered questions."[8] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[9]
The Guardian's critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."[10] Kenneth Turan of LA Times lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is Life, Animated's greatest strength."[11] Writing for Variety, Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from Roger Ross Williams ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."[12] The Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."[13] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post positively reviewed the series and said, "Life, Animated makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"[14] Rolling Stone's chief film critic Peter Travers said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."[15]
Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."[16] Reviewing for RogerEbert.com film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."[17] Entertainment Weekly's, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."[18] Kyle Smith of New York Post explained, "Life, Animated oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."[19]
Some publications were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of Empire David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."[20] Film critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."[21] The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind’s 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."[22] In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."[23]
The film is highly praised by the autism community and Disney staff. [24] [25][26]
Land of the Lost Sidekicks[edit]
An exclusive short, based on Owen's fan fic featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016. [27]
Sidekicks used in the film:

Baloo from The Jungle Book (1967 film) [28]

Life, Animated is a 2016 American documentary by director Roger Ross Williams.[1] It is co-produced by Williams with Julie Goldman, Carolyn Hepburn and Christopher Clements. Life, Animated is based on journalist Ron Suskind's 2014 book Life, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism, which tells the story of his son, Owen Suskind who struggled with autism and learned how to communicate with the outside world through his love of Disney films from Owen's perspective (the book was from Ron's).[2]
Upon its release the film received rave reviews from critics and won numerous awards including the Sundance Film Festival award for Best Direction and the Special Achievement Annie Award. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature category at the 89th Academy Awards, but lost to O.J.: Made In America.[3][4][5]

Synopsis[edit]
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him.

Production[edit]
The animation is done by Mac Guff, which also worked on films such as Despicable Me and The Lorax.[6]. To secure the rights for the clips and characters used in the film, Williams showed the unfinished product to the heads of department put together by Disney Productions president Sean Bailey. Roger refers to it as "the day I made the lawyers cry" after the end of the presentation. The films selected for the film were "100% Suskind". [7]
Reception[edit]
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Life, Animated offers a heartwarming look at one family's journey, and a fascinating message that's more than enough to outweigh its unanswered questions."[8] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 75 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[9]
The Guardian's critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."[10] Kenneth Turan of LA Times lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is Life, Animated's greatest strength."[11] Writing for Variety, Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from Roger Ross Williams ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."[12] The Hollywood Reporter's Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."[13] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post positively reviewed the series and said, "Life, Animated makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"[14] Rolling Stone's chief film critic Peter Travers said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."[15]
Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."[16] Reviewing for RogerEbert.com film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."[17] Entertainment Weekly's, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."[18] Kyle Smith of New York Post explained, "Life, Animated oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."[19]
Some publications were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of Empire David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."[20] Film critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."[21] The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind’s 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."[22] In a less enthusiastic review for Slant Magazine Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."[23]
The film is highly praised by the autism community and Disney staff. [24] [25][26]
Land of the Lost Sidekicks[edit]
An exclusive short, based on Owen's fan fic featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016. [27]
Sidekicks used in the film:

Baloo from The Jungle Book (1967 film) [28]
Timon and Rafiki from The Lion King [29]
Iago and Abu from Aladdin (1992 film) [30]
Lucky Jack from Home on the Range (2004 film) [31]
Sebastian from The Little Mermaid (1989 film) [32]

Mission Statement



In 1987 Roger Bailey decided to share a product with the Sign Industry and the Automotive Industry, designed to help apply pressure sensitive vinyl (decals/graphics).
RAPID TAC was chosen as the product and company name because I wanted to impress the idea that Rapid Tac was not only an aid in positioning but also an adhesive stimulant which aids in the a Rapid bond by helping the adhesive bubbles burst and uniformly bond rapidly. Roger was not familiar with the manufacturing and marketing of any products but felt he could learn fast with his 23 years of experience in the automotive industry and 7 years of management and operating his own body shop.
From setting up production, with code approvals, exhibiting at trade shows, building advertising and promoting RAPID TAC it was a big challenge. Roger vowed to never compromise the quality or benefits of the RAPID TAC formula and to this day the the formula has remained the same "unequaled" by any other brand X that has followed. Today RAPID TAC Inc has 5 products with more coming and has enjoyed a very successful 22 years with sales in 5 industries, 13 countries and over 500 wholesale distributors. RAPID TAC Inc will continue to add products, distribution and online sales to achieve further growth.
One thing that will remain the same! The pride Roger Bailey takes in the level of quality and friendly service offered by his business RAPID TAC Inc.

                          job performance, you can assign tasks efficiently, and 
                          you can influence behavior. The LAB Profile is a systematic 
                          way of gathering this information about a person and 
                          it is a set of clear-cut procedures to help you utilize 
                          that person's talents more effectively.Benefits 
                          of the LAB Profile...
                          The LAB Profile is an advanced communication tool which 
                          provides unique insights into the below-conscious motivational 
                          patterns we have in the context of work. It identifies 
                          what is required for an individual to be motivated in 
                          that given context. When this information is made available 
                          it becomes possible to make informed changes that can 
                          produce remarkable results. As well as giving powerful 
                          insights to the person being profiled it enables you 
                          to Understand, Predict and Influence others with integrity.Many 
                          organizations are already using this tool in a number 
                          of ways: 
                          Shorten the sales cycle and increase customer satisfaction 
                           
                          Design powerful marketing and advertising campaigns 
                           
                          Hire the right people who are motivated and suited to 
                          performing in their specific roles  
                          Lowering attrition rates and thus reducing the cost 
                          of recruitment  
                          Minimize the pain of implementing organizational change

                          effectively  
                          Identify why some people seem so difficult to deal with 
                          - and how to overcome that

                          strengths There 
                          are 14 traits in the LAB Profile; six Motivation traits 
                          and eight Working traits. The Motivation traits show 
                          how people trigger their motivation 
                          and behavior in the given context of work. The Working 
                          traits identify what sustains their motivation. 
                          There is nothing good or bad about a particular trait 
                          – it is a matter of understanding which is the 
                          most appropriate in the particular context of work for 
                          that individual.LAB Profile applications...Marketing 
                            Research: Since these patterns vary by Context, 
                            several methodologies have been developed to empirically 
                            determine the different below-conscious motivations 
                            customers have for competing products and services. 
                            This is used to create whole mass communication strategies.Coaching: 
                            The LAB Profile uses what's called Conversational 
                            Coaching, whereby the coach elicits conversationally 
                            the LAB Profile patterns of the present and desired 
                            state and casually overlaps the Influencing Language 
                            to enable the client to experience the outcome and 
                            develop his or her own solutions. Training for Behavior Change: Using the LAB 
                            Profile you can choose activities which will create 
                            the desired behavior changes for any target group, 
                            first by decoding the Motivation Patterns for the 
                            group and then understanding which LAB Profile patterns 
                            are addressed by any given activity. People Management: Train managers to identify 
                            the LAB Profile Patterns and thereby the strengths 
                            of their team members, so they can adjust tasks to 
                            suit what staff members naturally do best at work. 
                            Recruitment: 
                            You can profile a position and the corporate culture 
                            to create an advertisement that will be irresistible 
                            to those who fit, and turn off those who do not fit. 
                            You can screen the selected short-listed candidates 
                            to find the best match. (Note: LAB Profile does not 
                            measure skills, knowledge or attitude; just whether 
                            the person has Motivation Traits and Internal processing 
                            to fit the tasks and environment.)  
                            Skills Training: the LAB Profile will enable 
                            people to develop finely-tuned abilities in the following 
                            areas: Influencing & Persuading, Negotiating, 
                            Leadership, Conflict Resolution, Sales and Customer 
                            Service. Consulting and Problem-Solving: An easy to 
                            use LAB Profile methodology to diagnose and develop 
                            solutions to any communication problem. This is a 
                            favorite amongst business leaders and consultants. 
                             
                            Implementing Organizational Change: Diagnose 
                            the present and desired organizational cultures in 
                            LAB Profile terms and determine the appropriate change 
                            methodology for maximum sustainable results. Team 
                            Building: When you do a team LAB Profile, you'll 
                            determine the team's strengths and weaknesses with 
                            regards to their mandate. You'll identify communication 
                            patterns within the team and between this team and 
                            others, as well as determine the patterns of the next 
                            person to add to the team.  
                            Teaching and Learning: Teachers and students 
                            can easily identify LAB Profile Patterns which facilitate 
                            or cause difficulties in learning for individuals 
                            and groups. Minor adjustments can then be made to 
                            the teaching/learning methodology to correct challenges. 
                             
                            Modeling: The LAB Profile patterns can be used 
                            to decode any strategy or any skill, simply by identifying 
                            the behaviors (internal and external) used. This is 
                            an essential part of the modeling any particular behavior 
                            or skill another manager or employee exhibits, which 
                            can be duplicated.Origins 
                          and history...
                          The LAB Profile is based on cognitive science. It originated 
                          from research "meta programs" done by a group 
                          of people who founded NLP as a legitimate cognitive 
                          therapy out of Santa Cruz around 1974. This group was 
                          Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Leslie Cameron, Robert 
                          Dilts, Ross Steward and Rodger Bailey.
                          In 1982, Ross M. Steward and Rodger C. Bailey started 
                          to commercialize the meta program model under the name 
                          IPU Profile through their company Biodata Inc. According 
                          to an article of that period published in the Dallas 
                          Magazine in December 1983, Ross Steward was "vice 
                          president for product development at BioData and the 
                          PhD behind the test". One of their first customers 
                          was Southwest Airlines, which started to use the LAB 
                          Profile technology in October 1982 for all its recruiting, 
                          from V.P.'s to baggage handlers. Herb Kelleher, Southwest 
                          Airlines' CEO till 2001, was featured on the early advertising 
                          for the product.
                          In 1986, Ross and Rodger went separate ways, and Rodger 
                          started using the name "LAB Profile", short 
                          for Language and Behavior Profile. The meta program 
                          model started appearing in several books, such as "Time 
                          Line Therapy and the Basics of Personality" 
                          (Tad James & Wyatt Woodsmall, 1987) and in the bestseller 
                          "Unlimited Power: The New Science of Personal 
                          Achievement" by Anthony Robbins (1986), essentially 
                          bringing meta programs in the public domain. 
                          Rodger Bailey was actively promoting the product until 
                          1992. The commercial development of the LAB profile 
                          was taken over by Shelle Rose Charvet, having been solely 
                          authorized by Rodger Bailey to do so. Shelle founded 
                          the company "Success Strategies (based in Canada) 
                          and wrote "Words that Change Minds" (1995), 
                          which is based on Rodger's original work. It is considered 
                          to be the "official" LAB Profile book and 
                          is the only book Rodger actually "authorized". 
                          Currently, over 100 Certified LAB Profile Trainer/Consultants 
                          trained by Shelle Rose Charvet are authorized to do 
                          training and consulting worldwide using the LAB Profile.

                          background of the LAB Profile
                          In the late 1950s Noam Chomsky completed his Ph.D. thesis 
                          on Transformational Grammar. In it he explained that 
                          there are three processes by which people make sense 
                          of the world; Deletions, Distortions and Generalizations. 
                          These processes help us to create reality as we perceive 
                          it – because that’s all reality ever is 
                          – our perception.
                          Our perceptions are limited by the amount of information 
                          we can hold in our awareness at one moment in time. 
                          The American psychologist George Miller wrote a paper 
                          in 1956 which stated that we can only handle “seven, 
                          plus or minus two” bits of information at any 
                          one time and that we delete all the rest. It's interesting 
                          to note what different people delete or retain – 
                          this is one of the factors that make us all so unique. 
                          
                          For example: Someone walks over to you right now and 
                          gives you a kiss on the lips. This leads to a very interesting 
                          and complex series of processes that mainly occur beyond 
                          your conscious awareness:
                          You have the experience of being kissed. 
                          You have a number of sensations as you feel the contact 
                          of their lips upon yours, you may hear the sound or 
                          their breathing, smell their perfume or aftershave, 
                          see them or some other image in your mind's eye if you 
                          have closed your eyes, hormones will be released and 
                          you will generate an emotional response. 
                          You make meaning from those sensations. 
                          You automatically find words to describe/understand 
                          the pictures, sounds, feelings, taste and smells. 
                          Finally you make meaning from those words.. You Speak! 
                          
                          By the time you have created a meaning for the words 
                          you choose, you have exercised a number of generalizations, 
                          distortions and deletions. You will have generalized 
                          what a kiss means, comparing it with other kisses you 
                          have had, and the appropriateness of kissing in this 
                          particular context. You will have deleted many of the 
                          sensations you experienced because you will be aligning 
                          them to the meaning you have given the kiss. You will 
                          also have distorted what you experienced to align with 
                          the meaning. This could be anything from the pleasurable 
                          feelings of being loved or aroused, or feelings of anger 
                          and disgust at your personal space being invaded.
                          Should you want to describe the experience to another 
                          person you would use only the words that you chose based 
                          on what you filtered in or out of the actual experience. 
                          It is estimated that you would only be giving about 
                          2-7% of the details. Your listeners will then have to 
                          make up the rest based on their own filters and experience. 
                          Or if they are a skilled communicator they may be able 
                          to question some of your deletions, distortions and 
                          generalizations.
                          The way we filter information by generalizing, distorting 
                          and deleting gives us our map of the world, our way 
                          of choosing to experience life. The only way we can 
                          experience someone’s map of their world is by 
                          listening to the words they use to describe 
                          their experience. There is a wealth of 
                          information for the discerning listener in the form 
                          of the words people use. HOW someone says something 
                          is just as important to understanding them as WHAT they 
                          say. The language we use describes our reality! Thanks to johnsantangelo.com for this description!

As the name Billy Bob Teeth Incorporated implies, our company's origin has a toothy beginning. Our very first product was the world famous Billy Bob Teeth. When a dental student named Rich Bailey met an entrepreneur in the making, Jonah White, in the fall of 1993, history was made and they changed the way the world forever puts on their smile. The location was a college football game at Jonah's alma mater, Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri.

This story and many more are outlined further in Jonah's book,
"The Billy Bob Secret To: Life".

Jonah White recalls, "I was trying to watch the game with 15,000 other spectators and here comes this hillbilly across the stands with these bucked-out teeth talking and flirting with the crowd and cheerleaders. He was so confident insisting that he was better looking than Mel Gibson and not being shy, asking for multiple girls' phone numbers in the same sentence. Only out of complete luck did I meet Rich after the game and get let in on his secret of the 'Billy Bob Teeth.'"

 

"Rich and I became friends and he taught me how to make the Billy Bob Teeth. Up to that point, he had only made 3 pair!"

Today, the Billy Bob Teeth Company has manufactured over 20 million Billy Bob Teeth, selling to over 95% of the countries in the world!

Our company "sunk its teeth" into the novelty market even deeper in 1998 with the invention of the "Billy Bob Pacifier". An actual baby pacifier adorned with oversized buck teeth on the face shield. "We had our first baby that August and I was so put out that all the pacifiers out there were so boring.", recalls Jonah. With this addition to our line of products, the Billy Bob Teeth Company opened up even more global markets.

Within the span of just a few years our pacifier assortment grew from a handful of novelty pacifiers to over 70 designs. Most quite tasteful. This is one of our most successful product lines currently. All in all over 300 items are manufactured and sold worldwide by Billy Bob Incorporated.

Our most recent addition to our product line came from Rich Bailey's expertise as a dentist. "I've been helping people improve their smile for 10 years now as a licensed dentist. Many people just do not have the money or time to seek the audience of a dentist. Let's face it - conventional dentistry is expensive. Some people need an inexpensive route to fix their smile," Rich said. So Rich unveiled "Dr. Bailey's The Secure Smile," a do-it-yourself smile makeover kit. Already selling in Europe, Australia, Japan and the Middle East, the Secure Smile adds yet another dimension to this already "outside the box" company.
