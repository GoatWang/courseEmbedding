Cnh Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



ST. LOUIS, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) and CNH Industrial (NYSE: CNHI / MI: CNHI), a global leader in agricultural equipment, announced today that they are enabling wireless connectivity between Trimble® Ag Software and Case IH Advanced Farming Systems (AFS) Connect™ and New Holland Precision Land Management (PLM) Connect telematics platforms in North America. The collaboration enables Trimble and CNH Industrial to integrate their cloud-based software solutions to help farmers make more informed decisions with their farm data. 
The announcement was made at the InfoAg Conference.
This new functionality will streamline the flow of data from the cab to the office by giving farmers more accurate field records, eliminating duplicate data entry and a better understanding of their production costs. Data can be accessed from many places, including online, desktop and mobile sources. Farmers can choose to share information with a trusted advisor to assist in creating fertility prescriptions, variable rate irrigation plans or other cost saving strategies.
"Allowing Case IH and New Holland customers to seamlessly transfer their task data into Trimble Ag Software aligns well with Trimble's continued focus on providing a complete solution for growers to manage a mixed fleet of vehicles and implements," said Darren Howie, general manager of Trimble's Agriculture Business Solutions. "Whether it's planting, application or harvest data, our customers now can import even more valuable information on a timely basis and make decisions based on activities carried out by their Case IH and New Holland precision ag solutions."
Both AFS Connect (Case IH) and PLM Connect (New Holland) are telematics systems designed to transfer data wirelessly, securely and remotely between farm equipment and trusted farm management software, services or advisers.
"Our customers are making the most of their agronomic data and we are making a strong effort to give them extensive options for seamless and secure wireless transferability," said Joe Michaels, senior director of Product Management for CNH Industrial Precision Solutions and Telematics. "This connection to Trimble is yet another major option for our customers who want to move their data securely and quickly in order to make the most of it."

CNH Industrial Grand Island, USA, plant achieves Silver Level designation in World Class Manufacturing



                July 24, 2017


CNH Industrial N.V. has announced that its Grand Island, USA, plant has been certified Silver Level in the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) program. The site manufactures agricultural equipment, including combine harvesters, windrowers, stack cruisers, pivot tongues, sickle heads, and disc heads, under the company’s Case IH and New Holland brands.First opened in 1965, the Grand Island facility comprises three manufacturing complexes and employs more than 600. Its products are exported to more than 65 markets in Asia Pacific (APAC), Latin America (LATAM), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and North America (NAFTA).WCM is one of the global manufacturing industry's highest standards for the integrated management of manufacturing plants and processes. It is a pillar-structured system based on continuous improvement, designed to eliminate waste and loss from the production process by identifying objectives such as zero injuries, zero defects, zero breakdowns, and zero waste. To certify improvements, a system of periodic third-party audits evaluates all the WCM pillars, forming an overall score for each plant that is the basis for three achievement levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

The healthcare and 401K benefits are very goodConsLack of vision and management direction. Company isn't very good at planning to compete with industry competitors and often lags behind the innovation curve as a result. Also the company has a policy against giving raises, they won't even give out a yearly COLA raise. Pay starts out mediocre and stays there until you eventually leave the company for better paying work.Advice to ManagementThere is a reason all of your engineers leave immediately after being vested in the 401K contributions.

Positive employee morale is usually exhibited by confidence, discipline and willingness to perform. High morale in the work place is essential to success and is mostly influenced from the top down rather than from the bottom up.Managers that create low morale in employees do so from a top-down command and control mode, which implies that employees’ do the listening and managers need not reciprocate. There is a gap at this plant in addressing the real problems, thus further exacerbate them.Employee distrust, disrespect towards management and reductions of morale and workforce motivation will be this plants downfall.Check the facts Fiat.A costly indicator of low morale is high turnover; when employees leave because they are not happy with their jobs and have few external reasons to stay. The proof is in the pudding.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
CNH Industrial N.V. was incorporated in November 2012 and became operational at the end of September 2013 following the integration of Fiat Industrial S.p.A. and CNH Global.
N.V. Fiat Industrial, a global leader in the capital goods sector, was created on January 1, 2011 through the demerger of CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial from Fiat Group. However subsequently FPT Industrial was taken over/merged into CNH.
One of the top players worldwide in the agricultural and construction equipment sectors, CNH was created in November 1999 through the merger of New Holland N.V. and Case Corporation.[4]
The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on Borsa Italiana: it is a constituent of the FTSE MIB index.

N.V. Fiat Industrial, a global leader in the capital goods sector, was created on January 1, 2011 through the demerger of CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial from Fiat Group. However subsequently FPT Industrial was taken over/merged into CNH.
One of the top players worldwide in the agricultural and construction equipment sectors, CNH was created in November 1999 through the merger of New Holland N.V. and Case Corporation.[4]

N.V. Fiat Industrial, a global leader in the capital goods sector, was created on January 1, 2011 through the demerger of CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial from Fiat Group. However subsequently FPT Industrial was taken over/merged into CNH.
One of the top players worldwide in the agricultural and construction equipment sectors, CNH was created in November 1999 through the merger of New Holland N.V. and Case Corporation.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
