In the biggest sale of a local bank this year, USAmeriBancorp Inc. has agreed to sell itself to Valley National Bancorp in a stock deal valued at $816 million.
USAmeriBancorp is the parent of USAmeriBank, based in Clearwater and with $4.4 billion in assets and a branch network of 30 offices. The company’s securities trade over the counter with the ticker USAB.

It’s the most recent in a string of community bank acquisitions for banks headquartered in the Tampa Bay area. Ten community banks have sold or agreed to be sold in the past year. A decline in the number of community banks means small and mid-size businesses have fewer options for their credit needs, although bigger banks often offer more sophisticated products and services they can tap.
Valley National (NYSE: VLY), a $23.4 billion-asset bank headquartered in Wayne, New Jersey, has a small presence in Tampa Bay now, and the deal will meaningfully enhance that presence, a press release said. The deal will also give Valley its first offices in Alabama, where USAmeriBank has 15 offices.
Joe Chillura, CEO of USAmeriBancorp, will stay on as regional president of the Alabama and Florida west coast, from Tampa to Naples, after the merger is completed.
USAmeriBank shareholders will receive 6.1 shares of Valley common stock for each share of USAmeriBank they own. Valley closed at $12.40 a share on Tuesday.
In connection with the acquisition, Valley launched a preferred stock offering of about $75 million.




 


The $816 million purchase price is more than twice what Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ: OZRK) paid for C1 Bank last year. That had been the richest deal in the area in recent years until now.
The deal is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2018. USAmeriBank’s name will change to Valley National Bank after the close.
USAmeriBank was advised by Sandler O’Neill + Partners, Hovde Group and Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum & Nagelberg.
Valley’s advisors were Keefe Bruyette & Woods, MG Advisors and Day Pitney.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
