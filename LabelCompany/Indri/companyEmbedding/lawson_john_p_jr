Years in current job: 27
Years in financial institutions: 31
Education: Bachelor of arts degree, University of Louisville
Favorite way to relax: Bass fishing
Favorite vacation: Western road trips
Favorite local restaurant: August Moon
Type of music he listens to most:’60s, ’70s and little of the ’80s
What energizes/inspires him:“After a recent health scare, I am energized by simply waking up in the morning and having the opportunity to appreciate my life and my family.”
Why did you get into this profession?
The financial markets, with their ability to expand the economy by leverage and investment, have always intrigued me. I entered the industry as a financial planner and transitioned into bank management. In practice, I took what I learned in the abstract as a financial adviser and made it a reality as part of the management team that took our mutual thrift to a publicly traded savings bank in 2008.





How is technology changing your area of the financial institutions industry?
Technology is rapidly changing the way customers and clients interact with their financial institutions. Advancements in technology have allowed individuals to remotely access and control their finances. Institutions, regardless of size, must keep pace with technology to avoid being left behind by the market. Fortunately, efficiencies in the costs of these technologies are allowing regional and community banks to provide these same services as the mega-banks. Personally, I find great value in the use of “anytime, anywhere” access, especially with my financial activity.
What is your biggest concern about your profession?
Even the best-managed institutions face the risks from the weight of our federal debt. As this debt continues to keep interest rates at historically low levels, bank-operating margins continue to compress. Eventually, something will have to give, and it’s likely to affect all of us.
What would you change about the financial institutions industry in the United States?

I would like to see a change in the tax-exempt status that credit unions enjoy. This special status is no longer justified. This is a trillion-dollar industry that is not paying federal taxes. As we all know, the federal government is not operating at a surplus, so someone is making up the difference.
What advice would you give to someone who wants to build a career similar to yours?
Choose a workplace where you can make a difference. Learn and utilize the technology associated with the industry.
Describe an experience with a customer that was very gratifying to you.
On several occasions, I have had individuals remind me, in conversation, that I had handled their mortgage to purchase their first home and how much they appreciated my efforts. Not to show my age, but there was a time when a mortgage was a life event, not just a commodity.
What do you wish more customers understood about the way financial institutions operate?
I so often see news reports concerning problems stemming from activity in investment banking. Quickly, those reports absorb all areas of banking into their subject problems by referencing the word “bank.” The community bank space that I am a part of is far different from the Wall Street investment banking world. I think the public would be surprised by how much community banks have been victimized by the actions of those on Wall Street.
Why is a career in the financial institutions industry a good choice?
Opportunity for placement appears to be high over the next several years. As I attend banking events, locally and nationally, I find that a majority of executive and senior management officers are approaching retirement age. Many are reporting a lack of qualified succession candidates. There will be a void to be filled by individuals with the right skill sets. This presents a great opportunity for those who prepare a proper career path.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
