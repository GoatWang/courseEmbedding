An energy-saving alternative for use as non-essential lighting, these solar lights will turn on at dusk and provide reliable lighting until dawn. During daylight hours, the system naturally collects solar energy, recharging PbC® Batteries for the the next night’s use.

About Us Our History, Team and Board



History
The Team
Board of Directors














POWERING ENERGY INNOVATION
From a group of companies originally founded in Toronto in the late 1990s, a team of Russian scientists began developing a new energy storage technology that combined the energy storage properties of the commonly used lead-acid batteries with the power and greater usefulness of carbon-based supercapacitors. Founded in 2003, Axion Power was formed from these companies and set out to further advance the potential of energy storage solutions through improving this hybrid battery technology.
As Axion searched for production equipment to move their PbC® technology to a full battery prototype, they came across a Pennsylvania lead acid battery manufacturing firm called New Castle Battery that was foreclosed and auctioning off their entire plant. Through some fast actions and good timing, Axion was able to procure the plant in late 2005 and move the entire operation to the facility. The new facility offered the ability to produce PbC® Battery prototypes up to production batteries along with specialty lead acid products.
With a clear understanding of the original ground-breaking technology, the team of engineers and researchers at Axion Power successfully developed the first complete carbon negative electrode lead acid battery. In (2002), Axion Power achieved a patent for their PbCⓇ Technology, and today holds 15 patents for it.
Among other accolades, Axion Power was presented the 2006 Frost and Sullivan Award for innovation in the field of lead acid batteries. Frost and Sullivan recognized the technology as having the potential to “revitalize the lead acid battery industry by breathing new life into an established technology that is not well suited to the requirements of important new application like hybrid electric vehicles and renewable power.”
With the nearly 100% recyclable PbCⓇ Battery, Axion Power delivers an array of energy storage capabilities that can be applied to a variety of applications. Axion Power International, Inc. is a publicly traded company (OTCQB: AXPW).

Our Technology
A Better Battery


Battery Overview
What Makes the PbCⓇ Battery Different? 
Our patented PbC® battery is a hybrid that uses the standard lead acid battery positive electrode with a supercapacitor negative electrode made of activated carbon. The specific type of activated carbon we use has an extremely high surface area and has been specifically formulated by Axion Power for use in electrochemical applications. During charge and discharge, the positive electrode undergoes the same chemical reaction that occurs in a conventional lead acid battery. (i.e.: lead dioxide reacts with acid and sulphate ions to form lead sulphate and water) However, in the PbC® battery, we replace the lead negative electrode with an activated carbon electrode that does not undergo a chemical reaction at all. Instead, the high-surface-area, activated carbon electrode stores the protons (H+) from the acid in a layer on the surface of the electrode.

POWERING ENERGY INNOVATION
From a group of companies originally founded in Toronto in the late 1990s, a team of Russian scientists began developing a new energy storage technology that combined the energy storage properties of the commonly used lead-acid batteries with the power and greater usefulness of carbon-based supercapacitors. Founded in 2003, Axion Power was formed from these companies and set out to further advance the potential of energy storage solutions through improving this hybrid battery technology.
As Axion searched for production equipment to move their PbC® technology to a full battery prototype, they came across a Pennsylvania lead acid battery manufacturing firm called New Castle Battery that was foreclosed and auctioning off their entire plant. Through some fast actions and good timing, Axion was able to procure the plant in late 2005 and move the entire operation to the facility. The new facility offered the ability to produce PbC® Battery prototypes up to production batteries along with specialty lead acid products.
With a clear understanding of the original ground-breaking technology, the team of engineers and researchers at Axion Power successfully developed the first complete carbon negative electrode lead acid battery. In (2002), Axion Power achieved a patent for their PbCⓇ Technology, and today holds 15 patents for it.
Among other accolades, Axion Power was presented the 2006 Frost and Sullivan Award for innovation in the field of lead acid batteries. Frost and Sullivan recognized the technology as having the potential to “revitalize the lead acid battery industry by breathing new life into an established technology that is not well suited to the requirements of important new application like hybrid electric vehicles and renewable power.”
With the nearly 100% recyclable PbCⓇ Battery, Axion Power delivers an array of energy storage capabilities that can be applied to a variety of applications. Axion Power International, Inc. is a publicly traded company (OTCQB: AXPW).

Each system comes with a five-year full and five-year prorated battery warranty and is designed for more than 10 years of use.Axion Power's residential energy storage system adds flexibility and dependability to solar energy use, making solar a viable alternative to other energy sources, storing excess production for later use.  This allows the homeowner to be energy independent by maximizing self-consumption of solar, avoiding high peak energy rates and providing security in the event of a power outage.Comprised of 15 PbC Batteries, these systems are reliable and virtually maintenance free. PbC® Technology allows the system to operate in a partial state of charge and offers rapid recharge. In addition, PbC boasts a long cycle-life allowing for years of steady use resulting in a low lifetime cost of ownership.  The base 15 battery cabinet provides 7kWh (20-hour rate) of usable energy storage and can be customized for larger sizes.Axion's residential energy system, along with products such as their off-grid solar light kit (released earlier this year), can be combined to create smarter energy independent homes.Axion's 7kWh residential energy storage solution includes 15 PbC Batteries with complete battery cabinet and is now available for order with an introductory price of $7,995.00.

 NEW CASTLE, Pa. -- Axion Power International, Inc, (OTCBB:AXPW) announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Axion Battery Products, Inc., has begun the battery production process in their recently acquired New Castle facility. In addition, initial product has been shipped as part of a lead acid battery sale for a wind and solar energy storage application.  Thomas Granville, Axion's CEO said, "These are very significant events for Axion and represent a major milestone in the development of our business. We have begun the first phase of production leading up to the full manufacture and shipment of our Turbostart(TM) branded batteries, which will take place in the next few weeks. Since the official opening of our production facility, our New Castle sales team has obtained more than 1,000 orders for the Company's Turbostart(TM) Racing Batteries. Simultaneously, we are laying the groundwork for the production of our e3 Supercells. We expect to be making these e3 Supercells early in the 2nd quarter of 2006. We are very pleased with the progress of our facility and sales staff and have great expectations as we move towards production and commercialization of our e3 Supercell technology."  Granville continued, "We are also pleased to unveil our unique 'Battery Management System' (BMS). Combining our BMS with the delivery of 324 batteries will complete our first sales contract obligation and provide us with a $56,000 revenue event. While this initial sale is modest, we believe our future revenues will ramp up rapidly."  Axion's new Battery Management Technology is designed to extend the life of both conventional lead acid batteries, and the new e3 Supercell technology, and can be utilized in multiple energy storage applications.  Axion Power International, Inc., has developed and is preparing to introduce a new generation of rechargeable batteries that are part lead-acid battery and part super capacitor. Axion calls these batteries "e3 Supercells." Where conventional lead-acid batteries use lead-based electrodes for both the positive and negative poles, e3 Supercells use lead-based positive electrodes and activated carbon-based negative electrodes. e3 Supercell batteries use up to 70% less lead; offer longer cycle life; higher power; significantly faster recharge rates; and are maintenance free. In addition, e3 Supercell batteries are less likely to fail prematurely or be damaged by overcharging or other improper use. Axion believes its e3 Supercell technology represents the first major advance in lead-acid battery technology in 30 years. Axion is implementing a platform technology business model, where it will eventually manufacture electrode assemblies for sale to established battery manufacturers that want to offer a high-performance co-branded product.  "Safe Harbor" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:  Certain statements in this Press Release are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. These statements include, without limitation, statements concerning Axion's future business prospects and its ability to successfully complete the commercialization of the e3 Supercell technology. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include all of the risks inherent in commercializing a new product (including technology risks, market risks, financial risks and implementation risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties described in Axion's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available at www.sec.gov. Axion disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, financial estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Axion Power International Inc.



09/07/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 09/07/2016 07:35
Axion Power Broadens Consumer Product Line with Addition of Residential Energy Storage System








NEW CASTLE, Pa., Sept. 7, 2016/PRNewswire/ -- This week, Axion Power International, Inc. (OTCQB: AXPW) announced the release of its newest residential energy storage system, further broadening its consumer product line.
      

        The residential system features the latest generation of Axion's PbC® Batteries and works with inverters from leading manufacturers.  Power levels are available between four and eight kilowatts and can be expanded by paralleling multiple inverters to meet a variety of residential and light commercial needs. Each system comes with a five-year full and five-year prorated battery warranty and is designed for more than 10 years of use.
      

        Axion Power's residential energy storage system adds flexibility and dependability to solar energy use, making solar a viable alternative to other energy sources, storing excess production for later use.  This allows the homeowner to be energy independent by maximizing self-consumption of solar, avoiding high peak energy rates and providing security in the event of a power outage.
      

        Comprised of 15 PbC Batteries, these systems are reliable and virtually maintenance free. PbC® Technology allows the system to operate in a partial state of charge and offers rapid recharge. In addition, PbC boasts a long cycle-life allowing for years of steady use resulting in a low lifetime cost of ownership.  The base 15 battery cabinet provides 7kWh (20-hour rate) of usable energy storage and can be customized for larger sizes.
      

        Axion's residential energy system, along with products such as their off-grid solar light kit (released earlier this year), can be combined to create smarter energy independent homes.
      

        Axion's 7kWh residential energy storage solution includes 15 PbC Batteries with complete battery cabinet and is now available for order with an introductory price of $7,995.00. The system can be professionally installed with a new or existing solar system. For more information, compatible inverters and custom options please visit www.axionpower.com or contact us.
