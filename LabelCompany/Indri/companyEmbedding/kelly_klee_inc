In the Internet age, the need for reputation protection insurance has grown exponentially. Where before media coverage was limited and focused mostly on the most famous among us, now media outlets abound, and anyone has the ability to reach large audiences with salacious material.

Once you’ve flown first class, you realize just how cramped it is in economy, with food that is either nonexistent or unappetizing, and no guarantee that you’ll have room for a carry-on bag in the overhead compartment. In first class, you get more space for bags and legs, better provisions and specialized attention from the flight crew.

In January 2016, Chubb was acquired by ACE Limited, a company that was founded in 1985 to address a lack of availability for excess liability and directors and officers insurance coverage. In the 30 years after it was founded, ACE grew rapidly, diversifying its products through strategic acquisitions, culminating in the Chubb deal.
