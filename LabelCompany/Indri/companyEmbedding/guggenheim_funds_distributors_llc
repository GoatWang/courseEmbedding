Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

Guggenheim CurrencyShares® Exchange Traded Products Declare Monthly Distributions




















July 03, 2017 09:24 ET

 | Source: Guggenheim Investments






NEW YORK, July  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guggenheim Investments, the investment management division of Guggenheim Partners, today announced the distribution declarations for CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE:FXA). NYSE TickerFund NameDeclaration Date Ex-dividend DateRecord DatePayable Date/Share   Distribution FXA CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust 6.30.2017 7.3.2017 7.6.2017 7.11.2017 $0.05529          Distributions are made to shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of shares that are owned) only in the event that the interest earned by the Trust exceeds the sum of the sponsor’s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any. There is no guarantee that distributions will be made on a monthly basis. CurrencyShares® offer investors and institutions a convenient and cost-effective method of gaining investment benefits similar to that of holding foreign currencies, including potential diversification and hedging benefits. More details about the products are available at www.currencyshares.com. About Guggenheim Investments Guggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with $217 billion1 in total assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies. We focus on the return and risk needs of insurance companies, corporate and public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, consultants, wealth managers, and high-net-worth investors. Our 275+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses. CurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Products
Guggenheim Investments’ offerings are distinctive against a backdrop of sameness. Our clients enjoy access to many innovative “firsts,” as well as unique investment approaches across a range of strategies and investing vehicles:







Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
As one of the nation’s top ETF providers, Guggenheim’s investment teams have been breaking new ground in ETFs for more than a decade. We offer one of the broadest ETF line-ups in the industry, which investors can use to access new markets and asset classes, and potentially invest more efficiently in traditional assets—through strategies like target-maturity fixed income and innovative equity-index ETFs.
View Guggenheim ETFs




Mutual Funds
Guggenheim offers clients a wide range of actively managed mutual fund strategies, and for more than two decades has been a pioneer in bringing institutional-style portfolios to financial advisors and their clients. Our offerings span traditional and non-traditional assets from equity and fixed income, to alternative mutual funds, to innovative beta funds that provide broad market exposure and a vehicle for expressing investors’ strategic market views. Building a modern portfolio specifically fitted to your needs requires a skilled, resourceful, and innovative partner. Guggenheim is purpose-built to be that partner.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
Guggenheim UITs offer the convenience and diversification of owning a portfolio of securities in a packaged investment. We offer a vast selection of UITs covering domestic, international and emerging markets, as well as domestic and global industry sectors. These investment vehicles are professionally selected portfolios that allow investors to know what securities are held in the UIT as of date of deposit—once the securities have been selected, the portfolio remains relatively fixed for the life of the Trust. UITs have a defined life and a set termination date, allowing investors to rebalance their investment upon maturity.

CurrencyShares®
The CurrencyShares® products offer investors and institutions a convenient and cost-effective method of gaining investment benefits similar to that of holding foreign currencies. The foreign currencies market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world.
View CurrencyShares®




Indices
The Claymore CEF IndexSM (“Index”) is a 100% rules-based index that is designed to track the performance of a weighted basket of closed-end funds selected based on liquidity, income distribution and market valuation, among other factors. The Index follows a modified liquidity weighting methodology developed by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC.

Closed-End Funds
Guggenheim Funds is a pioneer in closed-end funds, bringing to market a variety of unique strategies not previously available in a closed-end fund structure. Guggenheim Funds' closed-end funds are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and feature a wide range of investment strategies for income-oriented investors. Strategies include covered calls, convertible securities, municipal bonds, preferred stocks and equity income portfolios among others.

More details about the products are available at www.currencyshares.com.About Guggenheim InvestmentsGuggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with $217 billion1 in total assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies. We focus on the return and risk needs of insurance companies, corporate and public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, consultants, wealth managers, and high-net-worth investors. Our 275+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results.Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.CurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result the Trust(s) are not subject to the regulatory requirements of investment companies.The CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar Trust,  CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc Trust and CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates.

About the Australian Dollar


 



The Australian dollar is the national currency of Australia and the currency of the accounts of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Central Bank. The Australian dollar is the fifth most traded currency in the world, accounting for approximately 8.6% of global foreign exchange transactions. The USD/Australian dollar pair is the fourth most traded currency pair.

Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares of the CurrencyShares Trusts are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. Performance results are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Prices shown are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise noted. 



The Current Interest Rate accrues daily and pays out monthly for the respective currency's interest bearing account. The Current Interest Rate, set by the Depository, can fluctuate as frequently as daily to reflect the local overnight rate, market conditions and the Depository's liquidity needs. The 40 bps management fee charged by the sponsor will be paid out of interest earned and has not been accounted for in the Current Interest Rate stated above.
Interest earned by the trust, if any, will accrue daily and will be used to pay trust expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to shareholders monthly. There is no assurance any interest will be paid, and if paid, may not be the best available.   If the trust’s expenses exceed interest earned, the trustee will withdraw the respective currency from the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the amount of the currency represented by each share on an ongoing basis and may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.
 

Each of the CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar (FXA) Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling (FXB) Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar (FXC) Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi (FXCH) Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro (FXE) Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen (FXY) Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar (FXSG) Trust, CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona (FXS) Trust and CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc (FXF) Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, you may click the links above or the Trust will arrange to send you its prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 800.820.0888.

The CurrencyShares Trusts are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and shareholders do not have the same regulatory protections afforded to investors in registered investment companies.

The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust.  This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency.  Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust.  Factors that may have the effect  of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national  debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, investment and trading activities  of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust are also subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. 

This website is directed to and intended for use by citizens or residents of the United States of America only. The material provided on this website is not intended as a recommendation or as investment advice of any kind, including in connection with rollovers, transfers, and distributions. Such material is not provided in a fiduciary capacity, may not be relied upon for or in connection with the making of investment decisions, and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell securities. All content has been provided for informational or educational purposes only and is not intended to be and should not be construed as legal or tax advice and/or a legal opinion. Always consult a financial, tax and/or legal professional regarding your specific situation. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

The information on this web site is for informational purposes only and is not, and is not intended to be, a complete discussion of all material information you should know about the CurrencyShares Trusts. 


CurrencyShares® are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. 


Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust can be bought and sold through a broker; as such, investors may be required to pay brokerage commissions in connection with a purchase or sale. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares of any CurrencyShares Trust will develop or be maintained. The risks associated with each of the CurrencyShares Trusts are not identical because of differences in the economies underlying each CurrencyShares Trust, as well as other considerations. For a more complete discussion of risk factors applicable to each CurrencyShares Trust, carefully read the particular Trust's prospectus.
      
        Interest earned on the deposited currency, if any, will be used to pay the Trust's expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to Shareholders monthly. Such interest is not expected to form a significant part of the Shareholders' investment return. If the Trust's expenses exceed interest earned, the Trustee will withdraw respective currency held by the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the number of currency per Share. This may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.  

        The NAV and Market Close performance may differ. A major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the NAV, which is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate and Market Close, which is calculated using Closing Price (last trade). WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time.   

        NAV is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate. WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time. Prior to 11/13/2008, NAVs for each CurrencyShares Trust, except the CurrencyShares Russian Ruble Trust and the CurrencyShares Chinese Renminbi Trusts, were calculated using the Noon Buying Rate, as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For more information, please read the prospectus.  

      The WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates are provided by WM/Reuters and are used for certain currencies (the “Rates”) displayed herein. WM/Reuters shall not be liable for any errors in or delays in providing or making available the WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates, nor for any actions taken in reliance on the same. This information cannot be used, reproduced, distributed, redistributed, licensed or disclosed in any way without a written agreement with WM/Reuters. 

      Spot Prices provided by FactSet. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the Internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades.
