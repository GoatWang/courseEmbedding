You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Why should I buy gold?
Gold buying has become an important part of investment for many investors, institutions or even individuals. There are many reasons why people buy gold, but many of them point to financial reasons. There are many different ways people are buying gold and this makes it important to find one that will ensure you are not exposed too much risk or fraud.
One thing that many people try to avoid when buying gold is fraud. This is because many people who are inexperienced cannot easily differentiate between real and fake. The only way to avoid this is by buying gold from trusted sources that have been around for a long time.
Gold is a precious metal that has been used for many years as currency or for ornaments. The thing that has made gold not be mainly used for financial transactions is that the amount of gold available isn’t enough. The amount of gold that is on the surface is far much more than what is being mined. The fact that gold has value as a metal makes it a better options in case of inflation or economic collapse.
He first reasons why you should buy gold is the pricing. The price of gold is usually near the cost of the products and below the margin of cost production for significant proportions of its supply. One rule that investors follow is, never fail to buy an asset that is below its replacement value. The price of gold also fluctuates, making it a good trading option. When the prices rise, you can sell the gold and make a profit. When it falls, you can buy with what you got plus the profit, leaving you with more gold than what you had initially.
Another reason why you should buy gold is because of diversification. Holding positions that are undiversified is one of the reasons why some people make a lot of losses. Gold is a good way to secure wealth without having to worry about inflation.
