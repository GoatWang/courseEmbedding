IS THIS PLACE A JOKE?  ARE WE ON CAMERA?
Our business gets a refund check in the mail. It states refund for card balance. I called the bank's 800 # because we're not in MI.  The CSR tells me that due to privacy, I need to take the check to OUR bank and have them call the 800 # to see if there's enough funds. THEY DO NOT KNOW IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS IN THEIR OWN BANK?  HAHAHAHA!!!!  That's when I asked if I was on candid camera (yes that'll show you my age) and clearly asked if this was a freakin joke!!!!!!!!!  She said well, the only thing I can tell you is if the bank account is opened or closed.  UMMMM WHAT A WASTE OF MY BANKS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!  We're a repair shop in a completely different state so customers have paid us through their online banking.  However, the amount doesn't match any outstanding balance and it's made from COMERICA CARD OPERATIONS.  We have NO card so now that this bank sucks clearly through the reviews I have read, but they suck so bad that they're now scamming people in other states to recoup money?  I say that because that's the only thing I can think of them doing at this point.  JERKS!

Do not get a HELOC from Comerica
We obtained a HELOC from Comerica in December 2017. Since then it has been a nightmare trying to gain access to the money. I wrote a check from the account but the loan department would not approve it. The HELOC department did not even have record of our HELOC account. In addition, at the time, there were some type of changes at the bank and I was directed to several numbers to call. I finally went to the VVL branch. I spent 45 minutes at the VVL branch trying to get the loan department to approve the amount (not even near the full line of credit) since the Mesa branch is too far from my home.  Finally, the branch (also after several attempts and numbers to call), reached someone in the correct loan department. The bank approved the check amount finally -- even though the loan department would not.
Since then, it has been a nightmare trying to get the money. The computer system is antiquated. You cannot transfer from the HELOC to the Comerica checking. Additional HELOC checks were sent to the wrong address (figure that one out), and after filling out an interest only form (at the beginning of the process and again in June), the full amount is still being deducted. 
The first six months is a great interest rate...too bad you cannot get the money out from the account. I specifically needed the amount for home things, but every time I tried to use it immediately, it was not approved (very embarrassing). I was told I would have to go into the branch for approval. Does not make sense at all. I was told to use the debit card...which defeats the purpose of using the money conveniently. Many vendors charge a high percentage to use a debit card.Plus...it probably would not have worked.
Avoid the HELOC from this bank. You cannot get the money anyway.
Sincerely,
Disappointed customer

Comerica is to Banks as United is to Airlines!
Our business account receives NUMEROUS checks using various versions of our business name and/or the business principal ...  This has been going on since the early and mid 70s.
Recently, we attempt to make a deposit with an over cautious teller that picks and chooses which checks will be accepted and which checks they will reject -- to make the situation even worse the checks being REJECTED were written from our other account and was issued to provide a paper trail.  BOTH accounts were owned by the same person!!!
With the numerous banks (both local and national) available to the consumer -- don't need to fight to make a deposit!
To make a bad situation worse ... when attempted to have the corporate office resolve the issue they were only able to repeatedly defend the pick and choose of the bank teller.
Don't bank here ... don't waste your time complaining to corporate -- there's no quality and they don't care!

DALLAS, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Comerica Bank's California Economic Activity Index increased by 1.3 percentage points in May to reach 131.0. May's reading is 47 points, or 56 percent, above the index cyclical low of 84.1. The index averaged 122.4 points in 2016, two and three-fifths points above the average for all of 2015. April's index reading was 129.7.








"Our California Economic Activity Index increased again in May. Revised data show that the index has increased for the 14th consecutive month. Results for May were more broadly positive, with seven out of eight index components increasing. They were nonfarm employment, unemployment insurance claims (inverted), housing starts, defense spending, house prices, hotel occupancy and the Nasdaq 100 Technology stock index. Only state exports declined in May. A cautionary sign comes from state employment growth which has clearly slowed down through the first half of 2017. Weaker job growth may exert more of a drag on the index in the second half of 2017 if current trends continue. The state unemployment rate remains on a downward trend, reaching 4.7 percent in May and June," said Robert Dye, Chief Economist at Comerica Bank. "This ties the historical low for the California unemployment rate, set in late 2000."
The California Economic Activity Index consists of eight variables, as follows: nonfarm payrolls, exports, hotel occupancy rates, continuing claims for unemployment insurance, housing starts, national defense spending, house prices, and the NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index (NDXT). All data are seasonally adjusted, as necessary, and indexed to a base year of 2008. Nominal values have been converted to constant dollar values. Index levels are expressed in terms of three-month moving averages. 
Comerica Bank, with locations in the key California markets of San Francisco and the East Bay, San Jose, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Fresno, Sacramento, Santa Cruz/Monterey, and the Inland Empire, is a subsidiary of Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:    CMA). Comerica is a financial services company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank, and Wealth Management. Comerica focuses on relationships and helping businesses and people be successful.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Simple Savings Calculator Help 
Using a simple savings calculator can help you quickly and accurately estimate the growth of your investment. To use this calculator, you'll need the following information: 
Initial Amount 
This is the starting amount of your investment, or how much you can initially contribute to the account. Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to contribute, your initial amount is crucial to your investment's growth.  
Monthly deposit 
    The monthly deposit is the amount you can contribute to the growth of your investment each month. Decide on this amount according to your monthly budget. Tinker with the amount to see how higher monthly deposits can boost your investment growth over time. 
Annual Interest 
    Estimate the rate you'll earn on your investment by checking Bankrate's rate tables. You can find the best rates on CDs, checking, savings and money market accounts. If you already know what you'll be earning, enter the interest rate. Make sure to specify whether interest will be compounded monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. 
Number of years 
    This is the number of years your investment has to grow. For example, if you're 30-years-old, and you plan to retire at age 65, your IRA has 35 years to grow. If you're purchasing a 5-year CD, your investment has 5 years to grow. Longer time frames equate to larger investment growth.

History[edit]
The company was founded in Detroit by Elon Farnsworth in 1849 as the Detroit Savings Fund Institute.[2] Its name changed to The Detroit Savings Bank in 1871 and to The Detroit Bank in 1936, being one of the few area banks to survive the Great Depression.[3][4] In 1956, the company merged with Birmingham National Bank, Ferndale National Bank and Detroit Wabeek Bank and Trust Company to form The Detroit Bank & Trust Company.[4][3] In 1973, it formed a holding company, DetroitBank Corporation.[4][3] The current name was adopted in 1982.[4][3]
In 1982, Comerica entered the Florida market.[4] In 1983, it acquired its hometown rival, Bank of the Commonwealth of Michigan.[4] It entered the Texas market in 1988 when it acquired Grand Bancshares.[4] It added the California market in 1991 when it purchased Plaza Commerce Bancorp and InBancshares.[4][5]
In 1990, Comerica received approval to construct a new headquarters building, One Detroit Center.[6]
In 1992, Comerica merged with a similarly-sized Detroit-based bank, Manufacturers National Corporation.[4][7][8]
In 1996, Comerica sold its Illinois operation to LaSalle Bank parent ABN Amro for $190 million.[9]
In 1998, Comerica signed a 30-year $66 million agreement for the naming rights to Comerica Park in downtown Detroit, home to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.[10]
In 2000, Comerica sold its credit card division to MBNA and formed an alliance with the company.[11]
In 2001, Comerica acquired Imperial Bank of California, which also had branches in Arizona.[12][13]
On March 6, 2007, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Dallas in order to move closer to its customer base in the Sun Belt.[14][15] In August, the company announced that it selected 1717 Main Street in Downtown Dallas. The company executives began moving into 1717 Main Street in November 2007 and the building was renamed Comerica Tower.[16]
In January 2008, the company was selected by the United States Department of the Treasury as the issuing bank for its Direct Express debit-card program. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments, such as Social Security benefits, to people who do not have bank accounts (unbanked).[17][18]
In July 2011, Comerica completed the acquisition of Houston-based Sterling Bank (Texas) for $1.03 billion, which greatly expanded operations in Texas.[19]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
In 2014, Comerica provided more than $8.5 million to not-for-profit organizations in its markets.[20] Its employees raised more than $2.2 million for the United Way and Black United Fund, and donated their personal time with more than 73,000 hours spent helping to make a positive difference in the communities it serves.[21]
Comerica has established a plan for reducing carbon emissions and has reported its progress in meeting its sustainability goals.[22]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Detroit by Elon Farnsworth in 1849 as the Detroit Savings Fund Institute.[2] Its name changed to The Detroit Savings Bank in 1871 and to The Detroit Bank in 1936, being one of the few area banks to survive the Great Depression.[3][4] In 1956, the company merged with Birmingham National Bank, Ferndale National Bank and Detroit Wabeek Bank and Trust Company to form The Detroit Bank & Trust Company.[4][3] In 1973, it formed a holding company, DetroitBank Corporation.[4][3] The current name was adopted in 1982.[4][3]
In 1982, Comerica entered the Florida market.[4] In 1983, it acquired its hometown rival, Bank of the Commonwealth of Michigan.[4] It entered the Texas market in 1988 when it acquired Grand Bancshares.[4] It added the California market in 1991 when it purchased Plaza Commerce Bancorp and InBancshares.[4][5]
In 1990, Comerica received approval to construct a new headquarters building, One Detroit Center.[6]
In 1992, Comerica merged with a similarly-sized Detroit-based bank, Manufacturers National Corporation.[4][7][8]
In 1996, Comerica sold its Illinois operation to LaSalle Bank parent ABN Amro for $190 million.[9]
In 1998, Comerica signed a 30-year $66 million agreement for the naming rights to Comerica Park in downtown Detroit, home to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.[10]
In 2000, Comerica sold its credit card division to MBNA and formed an alliance with the company.[11]
In 2001, Comerica acquired Imperial Bank of California, which also had branches in Arizona.[12][13]
On March 6, 2007, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Dallas in order to move closer to its customer base in the Sun Belt.[14][15] In August, the company announced that it selected 1717 Main Street in Downtown Dallas. The company executives began moving into 1717 Main Street in November 2007 and the building was renamed Comerica Tower.[16]
In January 2008, the company was selected by the United States Department of the Treasury as the issuing bank for its Direct Express debit-card program. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments, such as Social Security benefits, to people who do not have bank accounts (unbanked).[17][18]
In July 2011, Comerica completed the acquisition of Houston-based Sterling Bank (Texas) for $1.03 billion, which greatly expanded operations in Texas.[19]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
In 2014, Comerica provided more than $8.5 million to not-for-profit organizations in its markets.[20] Its employees raised more than $2.2 million for the United Way and Black United Fund, and donated their personal time with more than 73,000 hours spent helping to make a positive difference in the communities it serves.[21]
Comerica has established a plan for reducing carbon emissions and has reported its progress in meeting its sustainability goals.[22]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Detroit by Elon Farnsworth in 1849 as the Detroit Savings Fund Institute.[2] Its name changed to The Detroit Savings Bank in 1871 and to The Detroit Bank in 1936, being one of the few area banks to survive the Great Depression.[3][4] In 1956, the company merged with Birmingham National Bank, Ferndale National Bank and Detroit Wabeek Bank and Trust Company to form The Detroit Bank & Trust Company.[4][3] In 1973, it formed a holding company, DetroitBank Corporation.[4][3] The current name was adopted in 1982.[4][3]
In 1982, Comerica entered the Florida market.[4] In 1983, it acquired its hometown rival, Bank of the Commonwealth of Michigan.[4] It entered the Texas market in 1988 when it acquired Grand Bancshares.[4] It added the California market in 1991 when it purchased Plaza Commerce Bancorp and InBancshares.[4][5]
In 1990, Comerica received approval to construct a new headquarters building, One Detroit Center.[6]
In 1992, Comerica merged with a similarly-sized Detroit-based bank, Manufacturers National Corporation.[4][7][8]
In 1996, Comerica sold its Illinois operation to LaSalle Bank parent ABN Amro for $190 million.[9]
In 1998, Comerica signed a 30-year $66 million agreement for the naming rights to Comerica Park in downtown Detroit, home to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.[10]
In 2000, Comerica sold its credit card division to MBNA and formed an alliance with the company.[11]
In 2001, Comerica acquired Imperial Bank of California, which also had branches in Arizona.[12][13]
On March 6, 2007, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Dallas in order to move closer to its customer base in the Sun Belt.[14][15] In August, the company announced that it selected 1717 Main Street in Downtown Dallas. The company executives began moving into 1717 Main Street in November 2007 and the building was renamed Comerica Tower.[16]
In January 2008, the company was selected by the United States Department of the Treasury as the issuing bank for its Direct Express debit-card program. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments, such as Social Security benefits, to people who do not have bank accounts (unbanked).[17][18]
In July 2011, Comerica completed the acquisition of Houston-based Sterling Bank (Texas) for $1.03 billion, which greatly expanded operations in Texas.[19]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
In 2014, Comerica provided more than $8.5 million to not-for-profit organizations in its markets.[20] Its employees raised more than $2.2 million for the United Way and Black United Fund, and donated their personal time with more than 73,000 hours spent helping to make a positive difference in the communities it serves.[21]
Comerica has established a plan for reducing carbon emissions and has reported its progress in meeting its sustainability goals.[22]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
