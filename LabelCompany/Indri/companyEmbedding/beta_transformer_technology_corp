Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ #1  Q: Since I have a very limited board          area to work with on my dual-channel 1553 design, are there any Beta transformers          that can help me conserve space?  A: Absolutely! Beta's TST-9000 and          the TST-9100 Series are the perfect choices for designs where board space          is at a premium. Both Series offer dual transformers in a single footprint          package. The two totally independent transformers are stacked on top of          each other in a molded high temperature polymer case. Maximum height for          the 9000 Series is 0.280" and 0.320" for the 9100 Series. Both series          are available in three package styles: PC mount, flat pack or surface          mount. Please visit the Products section          of this site for detailed information about both Series of transformers.          In particular, read the press release listed on our Home page titled "Save          $$$ on Your 1553 Coupling Needs!" which highlights the TST-9100 Series.          In addition, go to our contact page          and let the Beta Engineering staff provide answers to your magnetics questions.        
FAQ #2  Q: What is Beta's delivery time for MIL-PRF-21038 transformers?   A: As part of our continuing effort to improve customer satisfaction, Beta is constantly striving to improve all our delivery times. Through improved and expanded manufacturing facilities, Beta has successfully shortened delivery times on many MIL-PRF-21038 pulse transformers. Beta now maintains an inventory on many of the 21038 products. For orders of less than 50 pieces, we can generally ship in less than two weeks. Orders larger than 50 pieces may require up to six weeks delivery time depending on the quantities required.

In addition, go to our contact page and let the Beta Sales staff provide answers to your delivery questions. 
FAQ          #3  Q: If my synchro (or resolver) circuit          design requires non-standard voltages, can Beta provide a Scott-T or reference          transformer to meet my requirements?  A: Beta was originally founded in          1979 to meet the needs of ILC Data Device Corporation (DDC). Since DDC          is an industry leader in synchro and resolver converters, Beta has manufactured          over 200 types of Scott-T and reference transformers for DDC which have          become Beta’s standard product line. If your synchro (or resolver) requirements          cannot be met by one of our products, Beta's Engineering staff will design          a transformer that will satisfy your application requirements. Please          visit the Products section of this site for more information about the          Beta Scott-T transformers. In addition, go to our contact          page and let the Beta Engineering staff help answer your synchro/resolver        questions. 
FAQ          #4  Q: Does Beta manufacture any space-qualified          product?  A: Beta transformer is the only approved          manufacturer that has MIL-STD-1553 product listed on SSQ-22676 created          to standardize transformers for use on Space Station Alpha. Both epoxy          cased and hermetically sealed units are included in this specification.          Several qualification levels of testing are available which includes Group          A and B of MIL-STD-21038 and Group C of 21038 or Group B of 981.

FAQ          #6  Q: I have a new SMT design, but I          do not have surface mount assembly capabilities. Can Beta help me with          my surface mount assembly?  A: Yes! If you purchase any of our          surface mount transformers, Beta will mount the Beta transformer(s) on          your surface mount board along with any other components your board requires          for a small additional charge. Beta has a screen printer, a SMT assembler,          and an IR/convection reflow oven that allows us to mount components with          pitches as low as 0.015". As mentioned, this additional SMT assembly is          only offered to Beta transformer custormers as a value-added service to          them. Please visit our Profile page on this site to see more about Beta's          capabilities.

Product Applications
 
Beta's high reliability transformers and other magnetic components are used in many critical military and commercial programs, e.g., F-18, F-22, C-17, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, M1A2 Tank, Space Station Alpha, EOS Satellite System, MD 111, JDAM, and Boeing 777. Whether your application is ground-based, airborne, space-level, shipboard or commercial, Beta's standard MIL-PRF-21038/27, Fibre Channel, or custom-designed magnetics will meet your applications' demanding requirements while providing excellent service for years to come. Beta power transformers can be used in applications requiring up to 200 VA. Our lower power versions are used for applications that may require single- or multi-tap configurations. Whether you require a simple, open-winding design or an application-specific custom package, Beta will meet your most stringent packaging demands. Many Beta product applications result from designs that required either nonstandard voltage levels, signal conditioning, EMI/RFI isolation or combinations thereof. Our experienced Engineering team is anxious to help you resolve your magnetics design questions and provide you with the highest quality component(s) available. 
Contact us for additional assistance          and information about your applications questions and requirements.

BETA Transformer Technology Corporation & CISSOID partner to provide Rugged, High-Temperature and High-Reliability Intelligent Power Modules









Bohemia, New York (November 2016) BETA Transformer Technology Corporation (BETA), the world leader in high performance military and space qualified magnetic products, and CISSOID, the leader in high-temperature and extended lifetime semiconductor solutions, partnered to develop compact and highly reliable Intelligent Power Modules (IPM). These modules are optimized for power converters and motor control within extreme environments, including aerospace, industrial, ground vehicles, automotive, and oil and gas. To meet the demanding environmental requirements, BETA developed high density transformer assemblies that combine multiple transformers into a single compact, rugged solution, with an extended temperature range of -55°C to +225°C. These compact transformer assemblies are ideal for board designs with limited space that are subjected to extreme thermal conditions. Furthermore, the transformers are optimized to provide the enhanced isolation, and extremely low parasitic capacitances associated with the fast switching SiC MOSFET transistors utilized.
“With DDC and BETA, we found the right partners to develop high reliability and high temperature transformer solutions for our SiC IPM and gate drivers. They bring to CISSOID their long experience in developing signal and power transformers for data transceivers and power converters as well as their high quality manufacturing facilities”, stated Dave Hutton, CISSOID CEO.
Beta Transformer Benefits:

-55°C to +225°C extended temperature range
Isolation up to 2,500 VDC
Very low parasitic capacitances support high dV/dt
Optimized to work with HADES2® Isolated Gate

Our partnership with CISSOID reinforces BETA’s long-standing commitment to solving the most challenging magnetics application requirements, and resulted in us producing the highest density and thermal capacity magnetic solution available. “We believe that this first partnership with CISSOID will trigger others as we see various collaboration opportunities between DDC and CISSOID, e.g. the development of high temperature motor drive or power converter solutions for aerospace, defense, and industrial applications”, stated Frank Bloomfield, DDC VP Power Systems.
