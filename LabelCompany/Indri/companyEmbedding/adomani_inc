                        GO GREEN
                    Answering the need for reliable green transportation solutions, ADOMANI provides complete zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle solutions to school bus and medium to heavy-duty fleet operators.By delivering value on the total cost of ownership, ADOMANI helps commercial vehicles run clean and save green.ADOMANI OVERVIEW
                The company began when serial entrepreneur Edward Monfort, who had previously launched high-performance car and metal treatment companies, invented a system to electrically re-power vehicles of all sizes while retaining and repurposing OEM components to reduce costs, minimize parts count and simplify service.
                
                Awarded a unique drivetrain patent in 2012, Monfort, with the help of friends, raised funds and founded ADOMANI Inc. to allow further drivetrain refinements and a fleet of prototype vehicles, including hybrid and electric conversions of the Ford Mustang, Ford F-150 and Dodge 1500 Ram pick-up trucks. 
                
                Challenged by a heavy-duty fleet vehicle industry executive who called it impossible, Monfort converted a Type-D Blue Bird School Bus to all-electric drive, with comparable power and torque. The challenge was fateful, and after discussions with top fleet managers, careful market research and due diligence, the company decided to focus on zero-emission, electric drivetrain development for school buses and medium to heavy-duty fleet vehicles.   
                We pride ourselves on our collaboration with trusted service partners to address our customers’ specific needs and ensure reliable service options down the road. Through customizing vehicle orders, providing ongoing maintenance options, or managing the integration of hybrid or zero emission vehicles ("ZEVs") into a traditional fuel-powered fleet, ADOMANI has the team and extended network to ensure long-term satisfaction.
                
                Our purpose is to spare you regular upkeep headaches and fuel cost concerns, in addition to allowing you to comply with ever-increasing federal, state and local air quality restrictions. By choosing ADOMANI all-electric vehicles, you get ahead of the curve in fleet management with vehicles that perform better, cleaner and stand out from the rest. 
                ADOMANI'S PATENTED TECHNOLOGYADOMANI ICE to EMA Patent:This is an Internal Combustion Engine conversion to Electric Motor Assembly ("EMA"). This patent allows ADOMANI to develop an all-electric motor assembly using the Original Equipment Manufacturer's ("OEM") accessory parts like alternators, pumps, compressors, and belts.  ADOMANI uses the existing OEM parts like the OEM transmission (with the torque converter), alternators, belts, pulleys, compressors, etc.  Since ADOMANI uses the parts on their patented EMA, that means anyone using an ADOMANI drivetrain does not need specialized infrastructure to maintain and repair its vehicles.  ADOMANI Electric Drive Shaft:Because of our patents, ADOMANI can place an electric motor of any kind between the OEM transmission and OEM rear end of any rear-wheel drive vehicle.  This is a very cost effective, efficient technology which allows a single part of an OEM vehicle to be replaced, like the drive shaft. The ADOMANI electric drive shaft is placed in between the OEM transmission and the OEM rear end allowing the vehicle to assist the gas engine, increasing MPG.

	DILUTION



	If you invested in our Common Stock in the offering, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering
	price per share of our Common Stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after the offering.


	Net tangible book value dilution per share to new investors represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of
	shares of our Common Stock in the offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after completion of the offering.


	Our historical net tangible deficit as of December 31, 2016 was ($2,951,495), or ($0.05) per share of our Common Stock. Historical net
	tangible book value per share represents our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding.


	Our pro forma net tangible deficit as of December 31, 2016 was approximately ($2,225,911), or ($0.03) per share of Common Stock. Pro
	forma tangible deficit per share represents our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016 after giving effect to the January 30, 2017 conversion of an
	aggregate principal amount of $645,000 plus accrued interest, a total of $725,584, at conversion prices ranging from $0.10 per share to $0.50 per share pursuant to certain of our promissory notes. Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per
	share gives further effect to the issuance of 3,276,385 shares of our Common Stock at the initial public offering price of $5.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Our
	pro forma, as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2016 would have been $6,934,242, or $0.10 per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $0.13 per share to existing stockholders and an
	immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value of $4.90 per share to investors purchasing Common Stock in the offering.

	UNDERWRITING



	We entered into an underwriting agreement with the Underwriters, with respect to the shares of our Common Stock in the offering. Under the
	terms and subject to the conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, we agreed to issue and sell to the public through the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to offer and sell, up to 4,400,000 shares of our Common Stock, on a best
	efforts basis.


	The Underwriters offered the shares to investors at the public offering price, and received underwriting commissions of
	$799,342. The funds were released to us on May 12, 2017 and on June 9, 2017.


	The shares of our Common Stock were listed on NASDAQ under
	the symbol ADOM on June 15, 2017.


	The following table and the two succeeding paragraphs summarize the underwriting
	compensation and estimated expenses paid:

	We have agreed to reimburse the Underwriters for expenses incurred relating to the offering, including all
	actual fees and expenses incurred by the Underwriters in connection with, among other things, due diligence costs, the Underwriters road show expenses, which shall not exceed $50,000, and the fees and expenses of the
	Underwriters counsel. As of the date of this supplement, we have not been asked to reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses, other than their counsel fees. The fees and expenses of Underwriters counsel shall not exceed $200,000 which
	we have paid. We estimate that the total expenses of the offering, excluding underwriting commissions described above, are approximately $2,510,515. We have also paid the Underwriters an advisory fee of $50,000 and we paid an advisory fee of $50,000
	to a predecessor firm.


	As additional compensation to the Underwriters, upon consummation of the offering, we issued to the Underwriters
	warrants to purchase 166,383 shares of our Common Stock, which is equal to 7% of the number of shares of Common Stock issued in the offering, at an exercise price per share equal to 120% of the initial public offering price (the
	Underwriter Warrants). The Underwriter Warrants and the underlying shares of Common Stock will not be exercised, sold, transferred, assigned, or hypothecated or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put or call
	transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the Underwriter Warrants by any person for a period of 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement for the offering in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110. The
	Underwriter Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the qualification date of the offering, in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(G)(i).


	The Underwriters received a commission of 3% on the sale of the Selling Stockholder Shares. We paid all of the commission on the sale of the
	Selling Stockholder Shares.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of 2,510,010 shares of Common Stock, net of the shares sold by Selling Stockholders, in
	the offering will be approximately $9,160,153, based upon the initial public offering price of $5.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.


	The principal purposes of the offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the
	marketplace and create a public market for our Common Stock. As of the date of this supplement, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offering. However, we currently intend to use the net
	proceeds to us from the offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities and general and administrative matters. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or
	investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments.


	We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from the offering and could utilize the proceeds in ways that do not
	necessarily improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our Common Stock.


	Accordingly, we expect to use the net proceeds as
	follows:

	The 9% Notes payable have maturity dates ranging from January 2017 to November 2017. All notes maturing from January through June 2017 have been extended by six months pursuant to a provision in the notes.

	The working capital loans have interest rates equal to 5% per annum and a maturity date of November 15, 2017.






	(4)


	A portion of working capital will be used for officers salaries.




	The foregoing
	information is an estimate based on our current business plan. We may find it necessary or advisable to re-allocate portions of the net proceeds reserved for one category to another, and we will have broad discretion in doing so. Pending these uses,
	we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	Our principal sources of cash are our existing cash and cash equivalents balances, sourced primarily from the proceeds received in private
	placements of Common Stock, convertible promissory notes and notes payable discussed elsewhere in the Offering Circular. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $938,000. We believed that our existing cash and cash
	equivalents would be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements until completion of the offering. As a precaution against our liquidity assumptions proving to be incorrect, on November 18, 2016, we borrowed $500,000 from an
	unaffiliated 3.8% shareholder which our Board of Directors authorized. The loan is for a period of one year, with an interest rate of 5% annually, with the principal and interest due at maturity. We repaid the note on May 12, 2017 from the proceeds
	of the initial closing of the offering. However, due to delays encountered in the completion of the offering and to other working capital requirements, including the ongoing costs of the offering, our assumptions were incorrect, and in March 2017,
	we borrowed an additional $500,000 from the same shareholder. The new loan also matures on November 15, 2017 and bears interest at 5%. We also repaid this note on May 12, 2017 from the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering. Our future
	capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors in the Offering Circular.


	We believe that the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $9.2 million will be sufficient to fund our operations at least
	through the end of calendar year 2018. However, as stated previously, there can be no assurance we will successfully execute our business plan, and if we do not, we may need additional capital to continue our operations. We do not expect to be able
	to satisfy our cash requirements solely through sales in the near future, therefore we expect to rely on the equity funds from the offering to fund our operations. The sale of additional equity securities in the future could result in additional
	dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our Common Stock. The incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and
	financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure that such capital, if required, will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We are currently incurring operating deficits that are expected to continue for
	the foreseeable future, and as we begin to execute our marketing plan, we expect our operating deficit will continue to grow initially until we begin to generate a sufficient level of revenue from our sales and marketing efforts.


	Since our initial incorporation in 2012 as a Florida corporation, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through issuing
	equity capital, convertible notes and notes payable. A significant portion of this funding has been provided by affiliated shareholders, although significant equity capital was also raised in late 2015, and the majority of the convertible notes
	outstanding was also raised in 2015 from non-affiliated third parties, as discussed below and in Note 6 to the audited financial statements contained in this document.



	Note Financings



	As of
	December 31, 2016, the Company had borrowed $645,000 from Acaccia Family Trust and other parties by issuing notes convertible into Common Stock at prices ranging from $0.10 per share to $.50 per share. On January 30, 2017, the notes plus
	accrued interest, a total of $725,584, were converted into 6,868,578 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2016, we also had outstanding a total of $4,255,325 of secured promissory notes, net of $884,700 of these secured notes that were
	exchanged for 884,700 shares of Common Stock on September 1, 2016. In December, 2016, we borrowed an additional $500,000 from a third party pursuant to a secured promissory note, and immediately made a $500,000 loan to another third party who
	operates in the zero-emissions drivetrain technology industry. We repaid this note on May 12, 2017 from the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering. All notes referenced in this paragraph will mature in 2017 and 2018. See Note 6 to the
	audited financial statements contained in this document.

	Equity Financings



	In a series of closings dated in fiscal years ended 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 58,542,350, shares of
	Common Stock to certain of its officers, directors and other related parties for an aggregate purchase price of $5,270,860. The offering, net of payments to the Selling Shareholders was for an additional 2,510,002 Shares for an aggregate purchase
	price of $12,550,010, with net proceeds to the Company of approximately $9,160,153.



	Options to Purchase Common Stock



	As of March 10, 2017, we had granted 30,375,000 options to purchase Common Stock. 26,775,000 of the options are exercisable at an exercise
	price of $0.10 per share; the remaining 3,600,000 options are exercisable at the average trading price of our Common Stock for the first ten days of trading, which commenced on June 15, 2017. As of May 12, 2017, 20,778,718 of those options
	exercisable at $0.10 per share have vested. If all the vested options to purchase Common Stock at $0.10 per share were exercised, we would receive proceeds approximating $2,077,872 and we would be required to issue 20,778,718 shares of Common Stock.
	There can be no assurance, however, that any such options will be exercised.



	Going Concern



	As of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $3.4 million and a stockholders deficiency of approximately $2.7
	million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $10.7 million. We have not generated any material revenues and have incurred net losses since inception. Our recurring
	operating losses and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an
	explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. Based on managements plans and the significant capital raised in the offering, that
	substantial doubt has been alleviated.



	Plan of Operations



	The delays in connection with the completion of the offering, and therefore the availability of the resulting net proceeds, which are
	approximately half of the maximum offering amount, has caused subsequent delays in implementing our business plan.


	By executing on the
	business plan described the Offering Circular, and given our actual proceeds in the offering, we expect to generate approximately $47 million in consolidated revenue, including approximately $1 million from operations of ADOMANI China, in 2017. We
	anticipate that gross profit from those sales will be approximately $13.6 million, including $342,000 from China. We expect that net income, excluding any adjustment for stock-based compensation, which we have not projected, will be approximately
	$4.5 million, with a loss of $634,000 in China. In the Companys opinion, the proceeds from the offering will satisfy its cash requirements for and beyond the ensuing twelve months.


	Historically, we have primarily focused on and engaged in research and development and product testing. As such, our strategy to implement our
	business plan depends upon unknown variables. Key assumptions underlying the estimates in the preceding paragraph for the remainder of 2017 U.S. operations following the successful completion of the offering are that we sell approximately 90 new
	vehicles (including school buses, transit buses, class 4-6 trucks and shuttle buses) and perform 61 conversions of vehicles from gas/diesel to all electric. We also assume we will receive carbon credit funds of approximately $2.9 million from
	various government programs, which we treat as revenue. We assume we will sell 6 conversion kits in China, including batteries, primarily to manufacturers of electric trucks. Our assumptions are based on our knowledge of and


	 


	10





	experience with the U.S. markets and industries in which we expect to sell our products. Similarly, our assumptions regarding sales in China are based on the knowledge and experience in China,
	augmented by input from resources within China and from consulting firms with extensive experience in China.


	Based on the above
	assumptions, we anticipate the need to hire and train 7 in-house sales staff and managers in addition to the contract sales people we intend to use. This may cost approximately $700,000 in the U.S., plus related commissions and bonuses. We plan to
	utilize our developing dealership networks to provide services for our zero-emission replacement drivetrain vehicles and new purpose-built zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles through such dealership networks by entering into
	agreements. Further, we plan to commit approximately $650,000 to marketing efforts in the U.S. and $104,000 in China. These efforts will include providing demonstrations in areas likely to show interest in our product offerings. We plan to continue
	to seek approvals from incentive programs. We anticipate the need to lease larger facilities in both the U.S. and in China based on the assumptions in the preceding paragraph which we anticipate will cost $191,250 and $15,000, respectively, over the
	next 12 months. Finally, we plan to continue our research and development activities to identify new product offerings and develop our international business. We anticipate these costs will be approximately $207,000 for our research and development
	activities in the U.S., and approximately $73,000 for our international development based on future projections.


	We assume a gross profit
	percentage on U.S. sales of 29% and 30% on China sales. We further assume that general and administrative, warranty, consulting and research and development costs collectively will be 17.1% of revenue in the United States and 85.6% in China due to
	startup activity and delays in procuring sales, the largest component of these expenses is salaries, bonuses commissions and related benefit and recruiting costs: 9.2% of sales in the United States and 34.8% in China. We also assume for the
	projected operating results the current U.S. debt will not be repaid from the proceeds of the offering, so interest expense will continue for a period of time. Because of the utilization of existing loss carryforwards in the United States, we have
	assumed there will be no income tax expense in the United States in this initial period, so the projected net income is 11.3% of net sales. In China, we have no debt, but have assumed an income tax liability that is 2.0% of sales, leaving projected
	net loss in year one of 55.6% of sales.


	Based on the projected results described above, in the Companys opinion, the proceeds from
	the offering will satisfy its cash requirements for and beyond the ensuing twelve months.

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN SECURITY HOLDERS



	The following table sets forth information known to us regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of May 31,
	2017, as adjusted to reflect the shares of Common Stock issued and sold by us in the offering, for:


	 




	 


	


	 


	each person, or group of affiliated persons, known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our Common Stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	each of our directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	each of our named executive officers; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all of our directors and executive officers as a group.




	Beneficial ownership of shares is
	determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Except as indicated by footnote, and subject to applicable community property laws, we believe each
	person identified in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose, including for
	purposes of Section 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Act.


	Applicable percentage ownership in the following table is based on
	65,310,928 shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of May 31, 2017, including the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes into Common Stock for Directors and officers shown below. We have based our calculation of the percentage of
	beneficial ownership after the offering on 68,070,930 shares of our Common Stock outstanding after the completion of the offering, and the issuance on January 30, 2017 of 6,868,578 shares of Common Stock, issued upon conversion of an aggregate
	principal amount of $645,000 plus accrued interest, a total of $725,584, at conversion prices ranging from $0.10 per share to $0.50 per share pursuant to certain of our promissory notes. Shares of our Common Stock subject to stock options or
	warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of May 31, 2017, are deemed to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the stock option or warrant for the purpose of computing the number and
	percentage ownership of outstanding shares of that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Consequently, the denominator for calculating beneficial
	ownership percentages may be different for each beneficial owner.

Eckert brings more than 23 years of operational service and product knowledge in the school bus industry







“We are fortunate to have Rick’s services, contacts and customer service experience,” said ADOMANI CEO Jim Reynolds.


Newport Beach, CA (PRWEB)
March 24, 2017
 ADOMANI Inc., a leading supplier of all-electric school buses, trucks and conversions, announced today that Rick Eckert has been appointed the company’s Chief Operating Officer.  The bus industry veteran brings extensive knowledge and experience in fleet management and logistics and joins the company from A-Z Bus Sales, Inc., one of the largest bus dealers in the United States, where he served as General Manager and Blue Bird, Micro Bird by Girarden, and Collins bus dealer for California and Hawaii.  
“We are fortunate to have Rick’s services, contacts and customer service experience,” said ADOMANI CEO Jim Reynolds.  “I have worked with Rick for over 13 years, and during that time I saw him grow his abilities, confidence and industry knowledge to become the leader he is today. His operational expertise adds to our already strong team, helping us maintain a standard of excellence as we grow to serve the demand for zero emissions fleets.”
During his 17-year tenure with A-Z Bus Sales, Rick managed the dealership’s fixed operations for both the Sacramento and Colton locations, but was known primarily for his ability to solve customer issues and get vehicles back on the road.  He has worked closely with manufacturers, air districts and suppliers to bring reliable solutions, product training and support to municipalities and school transportation fleets throughout California. 
Rick will work closely with ADOMANI’s vehicle manufacturers to ensure that the company’s proven electric drivetrain technology and partners perform at the highest level in providing the reliable zero emissions solution that the marketplace requires. 
"I am excited to be joining ADOMANI at such a transformational time in the industry," Eckert said.  "Zero emissions vehicles are not just a thing of the future, they are here today, and ADOMANI brings the best available product offerings and the most knowledgeable team to the industry."
About ADOMANI, Inc. 
California-based ADOMANI, Inc. provides school bus and fleet operators with complete Zero Emission Vehicles and plug-in hybrid solutions.
