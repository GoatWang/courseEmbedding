Job Details
               We commit ourselves to this vocation with lifelong vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. The primary purpose of these vows is freedom - freedom for loving God above all things and our neighbor justly, and freedom for mission.  Our commitment to chaste celibacy does not mean avoidance of healthy human intimacy, but rather freedom for loving spiritually and universally.  Our vow of poverty does not mean destitution, but rather simplicity of lifestyle for the sake of apostolic mobility and an unencumbered spirit. It also implies interdependency on one another for all material sustenance and financial support.  Our obedience does not mean blind subservience or an avoidance of personal responsibility, but rather apostolic availability in the context of dialogue and discussion.  Our Golden YearsThe new ambulatory for elderly Jesuits at Campion Center, Weston, MA.Because we are called to this way of life by God for the sake of apostolic service to God's people, we commit ourselves to the Society of Jesus for our entire lives. Many of us outlive our ability to engage in active apostolic works. In our golden years, our ministerial assignment is "to pray for the needs of the Church and the Society of Jesus." During those years, a Jesuit's material needs are cared for at a Jesuit-run health-care facility in Weston, Massachusetts, called Campion Health Center. For information on how to make a gift to support our elder and infirm Jesuits, please click on the following link.
