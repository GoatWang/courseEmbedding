Reviewed 26 March 2017




My husband and I are a long time kebab enthusiasts, and this kebab shop is so consistent in its excellence that it has become our default kebab. The staff are very friendly and they serve up lots of options to suit families (eg mixed plate/meat and chip packs), and the food is fantastic value.and by the way locals talk, this place is on its way to being a northern beaches food institution! well done!

“Turkish delight in every bite”


Reviewed 24 March 2017




I am a Frequent traveller to Cairns from Melbourne. I travel for 2 very. Good reasons; to visit my Grand Children and to indulge my self in the awesome meaty goodness of one of the best kebabs north of Melbourne.Although not a restaurant, it does have cafe style seating outside. It's menu items are not unexpected from a fine kebabary. It also serves fish and chips serving fresh local mackerel and barramundi.The food is fresh and tasty, service quick and the product is full of meaty saucy kebab goodness, a real carnivours delight.The kebabs come in 2 sizes regular which is huge and large which is purely for the glutton. They are lightly toasted and the bread throughout your feasting remains firmThis kebabary enjoys a good reputation amongst the locals and represents excellent value for money whilst delivering an excellent product. Prices start at $9.50 for a regular and $10 for the large lamb, chicken or mixed.There is also falafel available for the vegetarians.So if you are in the northern beaches area and have a hankering for a kebab you must try this place

Once every week we go to the Trinity Beach Kebab House to buy great fish & chips, kebabs and sometimes baklava. Always great friendly service from a family business that works hard to look after it's customers.

“Fish and chips at a Kebab House?”


Reviewed April 11, 2017




Possibly the best Fish and Chips in Australia (we haven't tried them all of course). Nice prices too. The Barramundi was gorgeous and cooked perfectly and the hot chips were simply perfect. If only our local Fish and Chip shop was this good (and this cheap).

“the King of Kebabery”


Reviewed March 25, 2017




My husband and I are a long time kebab enthusiasts, and this kebab shop is so consistent in its excellence that it has become our default kebab. The staff are very friendly and they serve up lots of options to suit families (eg mixed plate/meat and chip packs), and the food is fantastic value.and by the way locals talk, this place is on its way to being a northern beaches food institution! well done!

“Turkish delight in every bite”


Reviewed March 23, 2017




I am a Frequent traveller to Cairns from Melbourne. I travel for 2 very. Good reasons; to visit my Grand Children and to indulge my self in the awesome meaty goodness of one of the best kebabs north of Melbourne.Although not a restaurant, it does have cafe style seating outside. It's menu items are not unexpected from a fine kebabary. It also serves fish and chips serving fresh local mackerel and barramundi.The food is fresh and tasty, service quick and the product is full of meaty saucy kebab goodness, a real carnivours delight.The kebabs come in 2 sizes regular which is huge and large which is purely for the glutton. They are lightly toasted and the bread throughout your feasting remains firmThis kebabary enjoys a good reputation amongst the locals and represents excellent value for money whilst delivering an excellent product. Prices start at $9.50 for a regular and $10 for the large lamb, chicken or mixed.There is also falafel available for the vegetarians.So if you are in the northern beaches area and have a hankering for a kebab you must try this place

“Fish and chips at a Kebab House?”


Reviewed April 11, 2017




Possibly the best Fish and Chips in Australia (we haven't tried them all of course). Nice prices too. The Barramundi was gorgeous and cooked perfectly and the hot chips were simply perfect. If only our local Fish and Chip shop was this good (and this cheap).

“the King of Kebabery”


Reviewed March 25, 2017




My husband and I are a long time kebab enthusiasts, and this kebab shop is so consistent in its excellence that it has become our default kebab. The staff are very friendly and they serve up lots of options to suit families (eg mixed plate/meat and chip packs), and the food is fantastic value.and by the way locals talk, this place is on its way to being a northern beaches food institution! well done!

“Turkish delight in every bite”


Reviewed March 23, 2017




I am a Frequent traveller to Cairns from Melbourne. I travel for 2 very. Good reasons; to visit my Grand Children and to indulge my self in the awesome meaty goodness of one of the best kebabs north of Melbourne.Although not a restaurant, it does have cafe style seating outside. It's menu items are not unexpected from a fine kebabary. It also serves fish and chips serving fresh local mackerel and barramundi.The food is fresh and tasty, service quick and the product is full of meaty saucy kebab goodness, a real carnivours delight.The kebabs come in 2 sizes regular which is huge and large which is purely for the glutton. They are lightly toasted and the bread throughout your feasting remains firmThis kebabary enjoys a good reputation amongst the locals and represents excellent value for money whilst delivering an excellent product. Prices start at $9.50 for a regular and $10 for the large lamb, chicken or mixed.There is also falafel available for the vegetarians.So if you are in the northern beaches area and have a hankering for a kebab you must try this place

“Kebabs in Trinity”


Reviewed 13 May 2017




We lobbed in there on a Monday after flying in from Singapore.Looking for Aussie comfort food after being away we stumbled upon the Kebab place.I had the 3 in one kebab (lamb, beef and chicken) and you can option it up with some extras. I threw in some pineapple and boy what a treat when i got it back to the apartment.The wife got the seafood combination and the selection was spot on. It lasted another day for her.And the turkish delights were absolutely yummo.This is our 2nd time at Trinity Beach and this is the first and now definitely NOT the last time we will be there.The people are friendly and happy and can't do enough for you.The kebabs come in 2 sizes with difference between the small and large of $0.50 go figure?See you guys soon as I'm still in the region.

“Fish and chips at a Kebab House?”


Reviewed 11 April 2017




Possibly the best Fish and Chips in Australia (we haven't tried them all of course). Nice prices too. The Barramundi was gorgeous and cooked perfectly and the hot chips were simply perfect. If only our local Fish and Chip shop was this good (and this cheap).

“the King of Kebabery”


Reviewed 26 March 2017




My husband and I are a long time kebab enthusiasts, and this kebab shop is so consistent in its excellence that it has become our default kebab. The staff are very friendly and they serve up lots of options to suit families (eg mixed plate/meat and chip packs), and the food is fantastic value.and by the way locals talk, this place is on its way to being a northern beaches food institution! well done!

“Turkish delight in every bite”


Reviewed 24 March 2017




I am a Frequent traveller to Cairns from Melbourne. I travel for 2 very. Good reasons; to visit my Grand Children and to indulge my self in the awesome meaty goodness of one of the best kebabs north of Melbourne.Although not a restaurant, it does have cafe style seating outside. It's menu items are not unexpected from a fine kebabary. It also serves fish and chips serving fresh local mackerel and barramundi.The food is fresh and tasty, service quick and the product is full of meaty saucy kebab goodness, a real carnivours delight.The kebabs come in 2 sizes regular which is huge and large which is purely for the glutton. They are lightly toasted and the bread throughout your feasting remains firmThis kebabary enjoys a good reputation amongst the locals and represents excellent value for money whilst delivering an excellent product. Prices start at $9.50 for a regular and $10 for the large lamb, chicken or mixed.There is also falafel available for the vegetarians.So if you are in the northern beaches area and have a hankering for a kebab you must try this place
