About Us

























 


A 34-inch swing check valve delivered to the Alabama Power Co. in 1917. It weighed 8 tons (7 500 kg).




Crane employees share a proud 150-year-plus history of doing business the right way—treating people fairly, dealing honestly and ethically with customers, suppliers, and shareholders, and working hard to meet or exceed the expectations of customers. They also share a fascinating history of innovation dating from the early years of the Industrial Revolution to the current era of technology-driven product development and improvement.
 
Crane is committed to the highest standards of business conduct. Within that framework, our objective is to grow Economic Value Added (EVA) by continuing to transition to a more integrated operating company. We strive to create value for all our stakeholders with a highly disciplined approach to materially strengthening our businesses through successful implementation of the Crane Business System, through strategic linkages among our businesses, and through utilization of strong free cash flow for strategic acquisitions.

At first it's a lot to take in, but you get used to the fast pace, depending on department. I've learned that many employees couldn't care less about the company, which is humorous because it's employee owned. There is a HUGE disconnect between management/supervision and the happiness and well being of the general employees. The hardest part is understanding why management does the things they do, the way they do them. Not the most efficient or practical way. The most enjoyable part is seeing your hard work be recognized. Overall, it pays the bills.See all 3 CRANE STATIONERY reviewsAdd a reviewCRANE STATIONERY JobsDirector of E-CommerceNew York, NYSee all 1 CRANE STATIONERY jobAbout CRANE STATIONERYFor more than two centuries, Crane has been creating one-of-a-kind designs with meticulous processes and master techniques that elevate communicating to an art.

		    100 Years of Company History
		







 
John Crane has a strong legacy that dates back to the creation of the Crane Packing Company in 1917. Prior to World War II, the company’s England-based operations were sold to Tube Investments, which resulted in the creation of TI Group. Then in 1987, TI Group acquired the remaining regional operations and the company reunited as John Crane — named after one of the company’s original founders. In 2000, TI Group merged with Smiths Industries to become Smiths Group plc, a global technology company based in London. Today, John Crane is the largest subsidiary of Smiths Group plc.
1930s–1970s — John Crane has achieved many landmark successes through the years, including the design of the world’s first automotive mechanical seal in 1949. The innovative design was soon followed by the development and introduction of the John Crane Type 1, end-face, elastomer bellows shaft seal. This patented product revolutionized sealing technology and is still one of the most widely used seals in the industry. 
1980s — John Crane introduced the Type 28, non-contacting, gas-lubricated seal — another breakthrough in sealing technology. It has been used to seal pipeline compressor stations in locations as diverse as the mountains of western Canada, the deserts of the Middle East and the jungles of the Far East. 
1990s — John Crane developed non-contacting sealing technology for pumps that handle environmentally sensitive liquids. Applying this technology to a standard American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or American Petroleum Institute (API) pump allows users to meet or exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) stringent regulations for hazardous emissions. 
The company’s interest in R&D and growth through strategic investment led to the acquisition of three sealing companies in 1998 — Sealol, Safematic and Flexibox. These additions extended John Crane's global reach and expanded its product portfolio to include high-quality welded metal bellows seals; proven sealing and lubrication products for the pulp and paper market; and high-temperature and high-pressure cartridge seals for pipeline and refinery applications. The company’s seal support system portfolio grew again with the later acquisition of Lemco.
2000–2013 — In 2007, the company acquired CDI Energy Services, CDI Oilfield Services, Fiberod and Global Energy Products to create the subsidiary John Crane Production Solutions (JCPS). This branch of the company specializes in artificial lift equipment and services for upstream oil and gas production. Over the past decade, new acquisitions have also deepened John Crane’s investment in bearing technology — Sartorius Bearing Technology in 2007, and Orion Corporation and the U.S.-based Turbo Components & Engineering in 2011. The purchase of the Netherlands-based Indufil BV in 2008 added filtration systems to the company’s comprehensive portfolio. 

2017 — On March 9, 2017, John Crane celebrated its 100-year anniversary. 
John Crane still offers the mechanical packing and gasket products upon which the Crane Packing Company built its success. Each year, the company manufactures some 238,900 miles of braided packing — almost enough to reach to the moon — along with flat gaskets and live-load packing for valves.

Crane & Co. | FineStationery.com










Crane’s papers, made exclusively from cotton, have an elegant finish and substantial feel that adds sophistication to their products.  Unlike the wood pulp that is used to make ordinary papers, cotton’s strong, naturally soft fibers intertwine securely to add beauty, texture, and durability to the paper.  Ranging from traditional to whimsical, Crane offers a broad assortment of social and business products, including birth announcements, party invitations, business cards, letterhead, children’s stationery, and holiday cards.  Crane’s wide variety of products is designed to meet the needs of any individual’s sense of style and make a lasting impression with every message sent.
