The Fund received strong support from various prominent investors from North America, Latin America and Europe, including fund of funds, global private equity investment and advisory firms, insurance companies, and family offices, among others. The Fund received an anchor commitment from Vanterra Capital, a global private equity firm and fund seeding platform with a track record of partnering with specialized investment and operating teams. WM Partners' principals contributed the Fund's foundational investment through an in-kind contribution of Wellnext Holdings ("Wellnext"), a nutritional supplements company. 
The Fund is focused on acquiring lower-middle market companies with leading brands in the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) and Natural Personal Care sectors and integrating them into one consolidated platform, Wellnext. Headquartered in Sunrise, FL, Wellnext is a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of organic and natural plant and food-based supplements sold through specialty retail, natural retail and online / direct to consumer channels.

The Fund seeks to make equity investments of $15 million to $75 million in middle-market companies.
WM Partners was founded by Alejandro Weinstein and Jose Minski, who share over 20 years of experience working together. Mr. Weinstein is the former CEO of CFR Pharmaceuticals, where he orchestrated one of the largest IPOs in Latin America and ultimately sold to Abbott Laboratories in 2014.  Mr. Minski is the former co-founder and COO of Trolli, Inc., and led the company from a startup venture to its eventual sale to Texas Pacific Group. Mr. Minski also founded Wellnext. Jose Minski said: "We are extremely pleased with the support we have received from our limited partners in our first fund. We are proud of what we have accomplished to date, and are focused on being disciplined in our approach to building value for the Fund and our limited partners." 
Alejandro Weinstein added, "We are pleased to have successfully reached our Fund's target as we have an active pipeline of internally generated acquisition opportunities that we intend to execute over the next few years.  With these potential acquisitions, we strive to become one of the leading players in the natural VMS space."
