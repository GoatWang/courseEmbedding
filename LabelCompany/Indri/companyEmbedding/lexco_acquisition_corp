GENERAL
 




1.

General Information.




 



Applicant

 

Form of Organization

 

Jurisdiction




American Gilsonite Company (the “Company”) (1)

 

Corporation

 

Oklahoma




DPC Products, Inc.

 

Corporation

 

Delaware




Lexco Acquisition Corp.

 

Corporation

 

Delaware




Lexco Holding, LLC

 

Limited Liability Company

 

Utah





(1)            The Company will be merged with and into American Gilsonite Holding Company (“AGHC”), prior to the Effective Date (as defined below) in accordance with the Company’s and certain affiliated debtors’ Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan of Reorganization”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), with the Company then being reincorporated into a new Delaware corporation.


Except for the Company and AGHC (which will be merged with and into the Company), the foregoing entities and any other entities that will act as a guarantor under the Indenture (as defined below) are referred to herein collectively as the “Guarantors”. The Company and the Guarantors are referred to herein as the “Applicants”.






2.

Securities Act Exemption Applicable.




 
The 17% Subordinated PIK Notes due 2021 (the “New Notes”) of the Company, to be issued under the indenture to be qualified hereby (the “Indenture”), will be issued by the Company to holders of its existing 11.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the “Old Notes”), pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization will become effective on the date on which all conditions to consummation of the Plan of Reorganization have been satisfied or waived (the “Effective Date”).  The New Notes are being issued, together with certain other securities of the Company, in exchange for all outstanding claims of the Second Lien Noteholders, as described in the Disclosure Statement, dated October 19, 2016, which is attached hereto as Exhibit T3E.1.


The issuance of the New Notes is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 1145(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code exempts an offer and sale of securities under a plan of reorganization from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws if three principal requirements are satisfied: (i) the securities must be offered and sold under a plan of reorganization and must be securities of the debtor, an affiliate participating in a joint plan with the debtor or a successor to the debtor under the plan of reorganization; (ii) the recipients of the securities must hold a prepetition or administrative expense claim against the debtor or an interest in the debtor; and (iii) the securities must be issued entirely in exchange for the recipient’s claim against or interest in the debtor, or principally in such exchange and partly for cash or property. The Applicants believe that the issuance of the New Notes to the holders of the Old Notes will satisfy the aforementioned requirements.

INDENTURE SECURITIES
 




8.

Analysis of Indenture Provisions.




 
Terms used in this Section 8 but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.


(a)           Events of Default; Withholding of Notice.
 
The occurrence of any of the following events will constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture: (1) failure to pay interest on the New Notes (after a 30-day grace period), (2) failure to pay the principal amount of or premium, if any, on the New Notes when due, (3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply with any other covenants or agreements in the Indenture for a period of 60 days after proper notice thereof, (4) certain involuntary or voluntary insolvency and similar events in respect of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, (5) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $15.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities or insurance policies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed, (6) any Guarantee of the Notes of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect or such a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee, other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (7) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument evidencing indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Guarantor, if that default (A) is caused by a failure to make any payment when due at the stated maturity of such indebtedness or (B) results in the acceleration of such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $15.0 million or more.
 

4




Pursuant to the Indenture, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes then outstanding may declare to be immediately due and payable the entire principal amount of all the New Notes then outstanding plus accrued interest.  Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the New Secured Notes by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration.  No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
 
If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each holder of New Notes notice of the Default within 60 days after it occurs.  Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any New Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the New Notes.


(a)           Satisfaction and Discharge.
 
The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding New Notes thereunder, and the Trustee, upon written demand of the Company, and delivery of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, when:
 
(1)           either:
 
(A)          all New Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed New Notes that have been replaced or paid and New Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from this trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(B)          all New Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the sending of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the New Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation;
 

5




(2)           no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit (except a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to such deposit) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material instrument to which the Company is a party or by which Company is bound;
 
(3)           the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and
 
(4)           the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the New Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.
 
(b)           Evidence of Compliance with Conditions and Covenants.
 
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year, an Officers’ Certificate (one of the signers of which shall be the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company) stating that in the course of the performance by the signer of his or her duties as an Officer of the Company he or she would normally have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and whether or not the signer knows of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous fiscal year.  If such Officer does have such knowledge, the certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default, its status and the action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
The Company shall, so long as any of the New Notes are outstanding, deliver to the Trustee as soon as possible, and in any event within 30 days,  upon any Officer of the Company becoming aware of any Default, a statement specifying such Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
