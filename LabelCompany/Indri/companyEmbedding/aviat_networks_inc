State-Wide Microwave Network Case Study: Extra High Power Radios

This large western US state had a longtime relationship with a microwave radio vendor and would have continued buying from them if their radios and support evolved with the State’s needs. However, over time its needs changed and it had to have more capabilities from its communications network. But it did not want to unnecessarily build new sites and erect costly new towers.

3 Ways to Get Smart About Nodal Microwave

At a time in the not-so-distant past, there was only one way to implement microwave radio: one radio link per microwave terminal. Did not matter what type of link it concerned: protected, non-protected or multi-channel. From the advent of digital microwave radio in the 1980s and 1990s, terminals typically had no options for integration of co-located telecom devices. And to interconnect muxes or switches required external cabling and possibly a patch-panel.
Then in the early 2000s, so-called “nodal” radios came into vogue. Designed to address the drawbacks of the one-radio-one-link paradigm, a single microwave radio node could serve as a platform for multiple links. There were still limitations when it came to radio and switch interactions, but multiple sources of traffic could now be integrated and connected on the nodal platform.

We Put the Spotlight on Voice Over LTE (VoLTE)

As one of the most anticipated network technologies, Voice over LTE (VoLTE) has been discussed by operators for years. The expectation was that deployments would start in 2013, but roll-outs in North America were delayed.
Logo courtesy of YTD2525 Blog
Operators have faced a series of issues that include poor voice quality and long call establishment times. Once these problems are solved, it is expected that VoLTE will allow operators to provide  voice and data services using an integrated packet network. As the problems described show, the implementation of VoLTE presents challenges for the entire LTE ecosystem including microwave backhaul.
We have produced a white paper to describe some of the VoLTE requirements that must be met in order to overcome these technical challenges, which must encompass a flexible microwave backhaul as a key factor for a successful transition to all-packet voice and video VoLTE  networks. A brief introduction to VoLTE is presented and then different VoLTE backhaul requirements are described with possible solutions.

Transforming to the ‘Layer 3’ Connected Mobile Cell Site

Cell sites will need to begin to transition to Layer 3 IP services. Photo credit: zdenadel / Foter / CC BY-ND
The entire wireless industry is on the cusp of a transitive time where Layer 3 IP services will be needed in the access portion of the network. And the backhaul will be needed to provide them.
Under the pain of restating the obvious, we have all seen the explosive growth of smartphones, tablet computers and other radio-frequency-loving gadgets like e-readers. All these new-fangled high-tech contraptions need Layer 3 IP/MPLS services in the access and backhaul in order to deliver a satisfying, seamless user experience—especially for enterprise services. The question is how will the mobile network operators (MNOs) be able to deliver these services from their thousands or tens of thousands of cell sites?
Typically, the answer would involve deploying a regular router for IP services at each and every cell site. But have you seen the prices of routers lately? Cisco didn’t get to where it is today without having some heavy pricetags attached to all the heavy iron it’s shipped over the last 20-odd years. Suffice to say, it would be a pretty penny if MNOs equipped all their cell sites with their own dedicated routers. So what else can be done, you query?
It just so happens that Aviat Networks’ director of corporate marketing, Gary Croke, has posted an article at RCR Wireless going over what to do in these types of situations. But we’ll give you a hint: the IP router function should be folded into a single multi-service, multi-layer cell site device. Read the rest and let us know what you think.

All-Outdoor Radios Part II: Three Ways to Choose the Right ODR

Photo credit: mrbill / Foter.com / CC BY
A quick Google-glance around the Internet will reveal a panoply of all-outdoor radios (ODRs) in both microwave and millimeter-wave bands. ODRs do not conform to a universal norm in terms of networking features, power consumption, bandwidth scalability (i.e., capacity) or outright radio horsepower (i.e., system gain).
So if you find yourself asking the questions, “Which ODR is the best fit for my network?” or “How do I narrow the ODR field?” it is good to start with the basics.
The right product choice can be quickly resolved—or at least the candidates can be short-listed—by focusing on three ODR product attributes that most heavily influence the value-for-the-money (i.e., total cost of ownership or TCO) equation:

Packet throughput capacity, which dictates the usable life of the ODR
Power consumption, which affects the energy bill
RF performance, which impacts antenna size—more system gain equates to smaller antennas

For many microwave backhaul networks, the growth in underlying traffic is such that products which cannot scale to 500 Mbps/1 Gbps per channel will run out of momentum too early and precipitate the dreaded “forklift upgrade” (also known as the “CFO’s nightmare”).
These same CFOs are also suffering sleepless nights due to rising energy costs—which in some countries can double year-over-year. Therefore, it behooves the operator to seek and prioritize the use of über energy-efficient products, such as the Aviat WTM 3200, which—and this is important—do not compromise on RF performance.
That brings me to my last point: System gain (RF performance) remains a core TCO factor insofar as it can drive smaller antenna usage with the concomitant capex savings. Still, there might be little to differentiate ODRs in terms of RF performance—in which case the spotlight will fall on these other attributes to sway the decision.
Having worked on the operator side and wrestled with TCO analysis on many occasions, my experience tells me that you can narrow your ODR choice quickly by reflecting on these three attributes and the TCO gains they can deliver.

Big Promise for Small Cell Mobile Backhaul

Spectrum above 6 GHz is much more available for small cell backhaul than spectrum below 6 GHz.
A different solution to handle the burgeoning demand for mobile broadband capacity will be needed. More spectrum coupled with more spectral efficiency will not be sufficient. A clear solution is more sites, but deploying more macro-sites in urban and dense urban areas (where most of the traffic will be needed) will not be feasible.
Small cells promise a new “underlay” of outdoor and indoor, low power micro-cells that are deployed on public and private infrastructure within the urban clutter, are seen as seen as a likely solution. Sites being considered include:

Pole tops (e.g., such as street lighting, traffic light systems, electric utility poles, telco poles)
Bus stops
Building walls
Building rooftops

These new sites will need to be compact, simple to install, energy efficient and incorporate an organically scalable and tightly integrated backhaul solution. As a result, there will be many more sites—some projections estimate that up to 10 small cells will be deployed for every macro-site. Small cells hold out the promise of great gains for the end users but massive challenges for the operators.
Small cell deployments so far have mainly been concentrated in Europe (3G) and the USA (LTE). 3G small cells may also be deployed in other regions as a means to avoid the difficulties in obtaining planning approval for larger macro-cell sites.
It’s Still Early
Today, as far as wireless small cell backhaul (SCBH) solutions are concerned, there is evidence of product immaturity and hyperactivity in equal measure.
There is profusion of aggressively hyped solutions, including many that are a rehashing existing/niche solutions and at the opposite extreme some very new and unproven technologies. In practice, these solutions are jockeying for position while operators grapple to understand the formidable planning and infrastructure challenges being thrown up by their small cell ambitions. It is apparent that few appear that they will fully satisfy the anticipated and emerging requirements in terms of performance (i.e., capacity, latency, availability), size/shape, ease of deployment and most importantly, total cost of ownership.

Evolution of Trunking Microwave Radios

Aviat WTM 6000 trunking microwave radio
Back in the day, trunking microwave radios were huge power-hungry beasts that consumed vast quantities of power and space at equal rates. They were complex “animals” that took days to install and hours to configure. Then they had to be looked after like well-loved but aged members of the family—with care, all due respect and consideration. Over time, components went out of adjustment and had to be brought back into line through various tuning routines, but overall they did their job as the super-reliable backbone of the POTS (i.e., Plain Old Telephone Service).
Jump forward a few decades and the latest trunking microwave solutions are elegant and graceful—almost svelte. With their current high levels of electronic integration, a complete repeater system can stand in a single rack space—unheard of until the most recent products. Furthermore, these new systems consume dramatically less power—a typical 3+1 system (i.e., four transceivers) consumes less than 400 watts. So now, backbone operators can save significantly on operating expenditure because of decreased space and power requirements at their microwave radio shelters.
Evolving microwave systems from analog to digital microwave systems carrying digital payloads was a rocky and dangerous path. The next migration from TDM payloads to IP payloads appears to be just as treacherous. How can a traditional TDM backbone radio, typically configured with N+1 radio protection switching, be reconfigured to transport a non-TDM payload that does not suit N+1 switching? IP transport is a completely different environment altogether! Luckily, trunking radio system designers have not ignored the Internet revolution and are perfectly aware of these challenges. In fact, well-appointed trunking microwave radio systems allow a graceful evolution from TDM to IP, with capability to transport both types of traffic simultaneously—and with their own ultra-reliable protection schemes!
Today, trunking microwave radios can support both TDM and IP seamlessly, offer robust radio performance and highly reliable switching and really do make it easy for operators to design mission-critical backbone networks. They offer mean time between failure (MTBF) reliability figures into the hundreds-of-years and highly integrated yet modular designs, which make expansion very straightforward. Before deciding on a trunking microwave radio, consider if the system:

Allows easy migration from TDM to IP with a minimal amount of replacement materials
Can expand to an expected maximum channel capacity (for example, six channels) without needing additional racks, etc.
Enables repeater configurations within one rack
Has a field-proven heritage of reliability and performance

Simplifying Carrier Ethernet Networks Scalability and Operations

As symbolized at the recent EANTC interoperability testing event, Aviat microwave radios can help solve the complexity and scalability problems of Carrier Ethernet technology.
Carrier Ethernet (CE) transport networks are growing in both scale and complexity, requiring both vendors and operators to deliver solutions to sustain their growth. To help address this, Aviat Networks recently participated in the European Advanced Networking Testing Center’s (EANTC) annual multi-vendor interoperability testing event to validate several aspects of scaling CE networks, among other things.
Increasing CE network sizes increase the complexity of management—especially from a services perspective—when CE services span multiple network domains. The ability to partition management domains and effectively manage alarms that accurately identify and propagate notification of network faults, dramatically speeds up the fault isolation and resolution process across large networks. Utilizing and effectively implementing “Hierarchical Service OAM” in growing CE networks is valuable to overcoming this challenge and was a key area of the recent interoperability testing.
Another critical aspect of growth is dealing with multi-technology—not just multi-vendor—interoperability. As CE networks scale, there is an increasing mix of Ethernet switching, MPLS and, most recently, MPLS-TP internetworking emerging. One potentially complex area that was also tested was validating the operation and survivability of intersecting Ethernet and MPLS-TP rings in a multi-homed topology. The “ERPSv2 and VPLS Interworking” test validated that standards-based G.8032 Ethernet protected rings and MPLS-TP VPLS rings can interoperate, or more significantly “co-operate,” to allow complex multi-technology networks to deliver reliable end-to-end services.
To learn about these aspects of scaling and dealing with complex CE networks check out the EANTC white paper for more details.

All-Indoor Microwave: LTE’s Best Backhaul Solution for North American Operators

Aviat Networks’ Packet Node IRU600 is an example of an all-indoor microwave radio, which is one choice wireless operators should consider for implementations in North America.
There’s a lot of buzz in the microwave industry about the trend toward all-outdoor radios, but those who haven’t been through LTE deployments may be surprised to learn that based on our experience deploying LTE backhaul for some of the world’s largest LTE networks, all-indoor is actually the best radio architecture for LTE backhaul.
We can debate today’s LTE backhaul capacity requirements, but one thing we do know is that with new advances in LTE technology, the capacity needed is going to grow. This means that microwave radios installed for backhaul will likely have to be upgraded with more capacity over time. Although people are experimenting with compression techniques and very high QAM modulations and other capacity extension solutions, the most proven way to expand capacity is to add radio channels because it represents real usable bandwidth independent of packet sizes, traffic mix and the RF propagation environment.
All-indoor radios are more expensive initially in terms of capital expenditures, but they’re cheaper to expand and (as electronics are accessible without tower climb) are more easily serviced. While an outdoor radio connects to the antenna with Ethernet or coax cable, indoor radios usually need a more expensive waveguide to carry the RF signal from the radio to the antenna. So you pay more up front with an all-indoor radio but as the radio’s capacity grows you save money. There are several reasons.
When everything related to the radio is indoors, you just have a waveguide and an antenna up on the tower. To add radio channels with an all-indoor radio you go into the cabinet and add an RF unit. With an outdoor radio, you have to climb the tower, which can cost as much as $10,000. Also, when you add a new outdoor RF unit you may have to swap out the antenna for a larger one due to extra losses incurred by having to combine radio channels on tower….(read the full story at RCR Wireless).

Multi-Gigabit Microwave Networks

Options and Strategies for Maximizing Your Network Potential
In recent years the microwave industry has made great progress in capacity evolution – actually we’ve seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 times increase in microwave capacity over the past 10 years. In doing so, microwave has proven itself to meet the capacity of LTE and LTE-A applications and with some new evolutions to enable multi-gigabit links, is now well positioned for 5G as well.

State-Wide Microwave Network Case Study: Extra High Power Radios

This large western US state had a longtime relationship with a microwave radio vendor and would have continued buying from them if their radios and support evolved with the State’s needs. However, over time its needs changed and it had to have more capabilities from its communications network. But it did not want to unnecessarily build new sites and erect costly new towers.

Case for IP/MPLS Routers at the Small Cell…but not Just any Router!

With the goal of a hyper-meshed 5G street level network, clearly today’s small cell deployments represent just an interim phase in a progressive network densification—pushing the network outward. This means today’s small cell sites will become tomorrow’s macrocells, or hub sites.
Future-looking mobile operators have planned for this eventuality. In the developed world, small cell and the Internet of Things (IoT) drive mobile network densification. However, in the developing world the primary goal of enterprise connectivity spurs network densification, due to lack of wireline infrastructure to business buildings. The end result of network densification is the same.

3 Ways to Get Smart About Nodal Microwave

At a time in the not-so-distant past, there was only one way to implement microwave radio: one radio link per microwave terminal. Did not matter what type of link it concerned: protected, non-protected or multi-channel. From the advent of digital microwave radio in the 1980s and 1990s, terminals typically had no options for integration of co-located telecom devices. And to interconnect muxes or switches required external cabling and possibly a patch-panel.
Then in the early 2000s, so-called “nodal” radios came into vogue. Designed to address the drawbacks of the one-radio-one-link paradigm, a single microwave radio node could serve as a platform for multiple links. There were still limitations when it came to radio and switch interactions, but multiple sources of traffic could now be integrated and connected on the nodal platform.

Up to the Challenge? Mobile Operators Look for New Business

The mobile phone industry has been mature for some time. Around the world, most people who want and are able to use a cellular handset already have one—sometimes more than one. Even with innovations such as HSPA+, LTE and LTE-A becoming mainstream, average revenue per user (ARPU) continues to decline. Mobile operators may be at the crossroads. They are certainly at an inflection point. How to counter the trend is what operators must decide.

What Does it Take to Get the Most out of Your Wireless Backhaul?

Many wireless operators, such as MTN in Ghana, need to optimize management of their networks and Aviat can help with products, services and software capabilities. Photo credit: Rachel Strohm / Foter.com / CC BY-ND
Wireless backhaul operators, both mobile phone networks and others carrying dedicated traffic, face the constant issue of maximizing the functionality of their systems.
In the emerging markets around the world, the pressure can be most intense. Wireless network reliability, availability and capacity all need to be increased. Customer expectations are on the rise, and operators must take the appropriate steps to meet and exceed them.
In working with MTN Ghana, Aviat Networks recently completed an implementation to increase network visibility (i.e., intelligence) by close to one-third. Aviat’s professional services experts designed the mobile operator’s backhaul links for high capacity and resiliency. Using ProVision, Aviat’s leading network management software, MTN Ghana can now administer its wireless backhaul efficiently and effectively with a reduced level of manpower.

Possibly the World’s Oldest Microwave Link Still in Service

John Lennon was still alive when Aviat’s oldest microwave link first went operational in 1980. Photo credit: Roy Kerwood / Foter.com / CC BY
The year was 1980. The Americans beat the Russians for the Olympic gold medal in hockey. John Lennon of The Beatles was killed. Mount St. Helens erupted. The Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan was elected president. The hostages were still in Iran. People asked themselves, “Who shot J.R.?” and caught Pac-Man fever. Voyager 1 flew by Saturn and left the solar system. The Empire struck back. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were on a “mission from God.” The Clash came calling on London. Led Zeppelin broke up. And Farinon Electric, Aviat Networks’ direct predecessor, put into service a series of analog microwave radio hops for the Canadian province of Nova Scotia’s Department of Natural Resources. The radios in question were the SS2000 model.
The province used them to carry government data traffic for firefighters and police, where data bits were stuffed into 4kHz voice channels. Remarkably, 33 years later, three hops of these SS2000 radios are still in operation, making these, quite possibly, the world’s oldest continuously in-service microwave links.
Farinon SS2000 analog microwave radio transmitters (but not entire units) were available for sale on eBay as recently as 2011! How’s that for longevity?!
Offering 120, 300 or 600 voice channels on the old 2GHz band, SS2000 radios were considered cutting-edge technology at the time—check out their cool retro-style data sheet—and highly reliable with their ability to provide microwave links despite the challenging weather and difficult propagation conditions of Nova Scotia—snow, ice, sleet, fog…they have it all! As proof, four other SS2000 radio hops were recently decommissioned and found to still be working up to spec as per the original, accepted level of performance. Then there was someone selling SS2000 radios on eBay in 2011!
But we challenge you, our loyal blog readers, to tell us of any even older microwave links that have been in operation for more than 33 years. So if you have an Aviat Networks link, or that from a predecessor company, which is still operating today and was installed before 1980, please comment! We want to hear from you!

3 Important Questions for Ultra-Low Latency Microwave Networks

Are you considering building an ultra-low latency microwave network? Then you are not alone. Microwave is quickly becoming the default transport choice for low latency networks. However, building an ultra-low latency microwave network is not simple; there are many considerations. Latency through the “box” is important, but it is not the only factor, and too much focus on this metric may be a distraction. What is most important is end-to-end latency of the link. Aviat Networks recently addressed this topic in a webinar (registration required) and free presentation download and answered three very important questions regarding ultra-low latency microwave technology.
Also in this webinar, Travis Mitchell, Aviat Networks director of low latency business development, and Sergio Licardie, Aviat Networks senior director of systems engineering, consider the best practices for ultra-low latency microwave networks as they explore the techniques, technologies and design approaches necessary to ensure lowest end-to-end latency. They also discuss some innovations to look for in microwave networking to ensure continuous improvement in end-to-end latency performance. Other topics covered include:

Main contributors to end-to-end latency of microwave networks
Best options to reduce overall latency
Strategies to avoid compromising overall availability

Got Protection? Diversity Schemes and Other Methods

Dick Laine, longtime principal engineer for Aviat Networks, delivers one of his patented presentations on microwave networking during an installment of the video blog Radio Head Technology Series.
Microwave radios come and microwave radios go, but the sage advice of Aviat Networks Principal Engineer, Dick Laine, has no end-of-life. In our seventh installment of the very popular video blog Radio Head Technology Series Dick talks about the diversity of diversity schemes and other protection methods available to microwave networking engineers.
Using examples from the radio legacy of Aviat Networks (e.g., Constellation, MegaStar—you must remember these, it hasn’t been that long) and our current microwave networking solutions (e.g., Eclipse, TRuepoint 6500, WTM 6000) he expounds on the past, present and future of protection. From Angle Diversity (one of the earliest diversity schemes used in Line-of-Sight digital microwave) to Hybrid Diversity (HD) and Frequency Diversity (that need licensing waivers to be used in many applications) to comparisons of fiber-like protection methods, Dick covers it all. For example, did you know that a four-dish HD antenna arrangement offers little to no performance improvement over a three-dish HD configuration?
So with free registration to the video series you can have the benefit of all of Dick’s wisdom and nonpareil presentation style on Diversity. You get access to all the earlier videos, too. (Did we mention there are six previous episodes?) And the presentation slides. And the podcast. And all for FREE! Wow! If you don’t see a topic that you think needs to be covered, feel free to submit your suggestion into our inbox. Register today!

Aviat Networks (NASDAQ:AVNW) is a global provider of microwave networking solutions, providing public and private operators with communications networks to accommodate the exploding growth of IP-centric, multi-gigabit data services.[2]
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Aviat Networks also has operations in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Rim, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and South America. Aviat relocated its corporate functions to Santa Clara from Morrisville, North Carolina, in June 2010.[3]
The company was founded on January 29, 2007 with the merger of Harris Corporation’s Microwave Communications Division and Stratex Networks and incorporated under the name Harris Stratex Networks.[4] The company renamed and rebranded itself to become Aviat Networks on January 28, 2010.[5]
With approximately 1,000 employees worldwide, the company's CEO is Mike Pangia, who was appointed as CEO on July 18, 2011.[6]

Customer profile and recent contracts[edit]
Aviat Networks customers include BT Group,[7] Africell,[8] Zain,[9] Optus,[10] Uninor,[11] Hormuud Telecom,[12] and Melita PLC.[13]
Recent customer contracts include:

As the primary supplier of mobile WiMAX equipment to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), the world’s seventh largest telecommunications service provider, Aviat helped supply India’s first urban mobile WiMAX network.[14]
Through its contract with MTS Allstream to build packet-based backhaul as part of its HSPA network, Aviat helps provides access to 97% of Manitoba, Canada’s population.[15]
Aviat’s NetBoss XT Network Management Solution for Lithuania Railway made possible the first-ever GSM-R implementation in the Baltic Region.[16]
Aviat has received orders worth $13 million for a combination of microwave backhaul equipment and services to support the State of Oregon's State Radio System.[17]

Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2009, Harris Stratex acquired Telsima, developer and provider of WiMAX Forum Certified products for use in next-generation broadband wireless networks, for $12 million. In September 2008, Harris Stratex announced a partnership agreement with Telsima for end-to-end 4G network solutions.[18]
Name and ticker symbol change[edit]
On January 28, 2010, at the opening of the Nasdaq trading session,[19] Harris Stratex Networks announced they have renamed their company to become Aviat Networks.[5] Along with the name change the company unveiled new corporate branding with a new company logo and relaunch of the corporate website. The company also changed their NASDAQ ticker symbol to AVNW. The new symbol begun trading on the morning of January 29, 2010, retiring the old HSTX; this date also marked the company's third anniversary since incorporation.
Advanced IP migration[edit]
Simultaneous to the brand launch, Xchange Magazine reported that Aviat was focusing in on aiding the carrier transition from legacy to all-IP and LTE networks, and helping operators reach rural and underserved areas with wireless broadband.[20] In support of these claims, Aviat announced a few weeks later at Mobile World Congress that it was adding cell site gateway functionality (normally provided by an external device) to the Eclipse Packet Node platform, making possible seamless TDM to IP backhaul migration. They explained that the gateway features were made possible by a plug-and-play Network Convergence Module (NCM), designed to fit in the Eclipse nodal indoor unit, giving wireless operators the choice to support legacy TDM traffic over an all packet backhaul network as an alternative to transporting TDM natively using a hybrid configuration.[21]

The company was founded on January 29, 2007 with the merger of Harris Corporation’s Microwave Communications Division and Stratex Networks and incorporated under the name Harris Stratex Networks.[4] The company renamed and rebranded itself to become Aviat Networks on January 28, 2010.[5]

Customer profile and recent contracts[edit]
Aviat Networks customers include BT Group,[7] Africell,[8] Zain,[9] Optus,[10] Uninor,[11] Hormuud Telecom,[12] and Melita PLC.[13]
Recent customer contracts include:

As the primary supplier of mobile WiMAX equipment to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), the world’s seventh largest telecommunications service provider, Aviat helped supply India’s first urban mobile WiMAX network.[14]
Through its contract with MTS Allstream to build packet-based backhaul as part of its HSPA network, Aviat helps provides access to 97% of Manitoba, Canada’s population.[15]
Aviat’s NetBoss XT Network Management Solution for Lithuania Railway made possible the first-ever GSM-R implementation in the Baltic Region.[16]
Aviat has received orders worth $13 million for a combination of microwave backhaul equipment and services to support the State of Oregon's State Radio System.[17]

Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2009, Harris Stratex acquired Telsima, developer and provider of WiMAX Forum Certified products for use in next-generation broadband wireless networks, for $12 million. In September 2008, Harris Stratex announced a partnership agreement with Telsima for end-to-end 4G network solutions.[18]
Name and ticker symbol change[edit]
On January 28, 2010, at the opening of the Nasdaq trading session,[19] Harris Stratex Networks announced they have renamed their company to become Aviat Networks.[5] Along with the name change the company unveiled new corporate branding with a new company logo and relaunch of the corporate website. The company also changed their NASDAQ ticker symbol to AVNW. The new symbol begun trading on the morning of January 29, 2010, retiring the old HSTX; this date also marked the company's third anniversary since incorporation.
Advanced IP migration[edit]
Simultaneous to the brand launch, Xchange Magazine reported that Aviat was focusing in on aiding the carrier transition from legacy to all-IP and LTE networks, and helping operators reach rural and underserved areas with wireless broadband.[20] In support of these claims, Aviat announced a few weeks later at Mobile World Congress that it was adding cell site gateway functionality (normally provided by an external device) to the Eclipse Packet Node platform, making possible seamless TDM to IP backhaul migration. They explained that the gateway features were made possible by a plug-and-play Network Convergence Module (NCM), designed to fit in the Eclipse nodal indoor unit, giving wireless operators the choice to support legacy TDM traffic over an all packet backhaul network as an alternative to transporting TDM natively using a hybrid configuration.[21]

Aviat Networks (NASDAQ:AVNW) is a global provider of microwave networking solutions, providing public and private operators with communications networks to accommodate the exploding growth of IP-centric, multi-gigabit data services.[2]
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Aviat Networks also has operations in Africa, Asia and the Pacific Rim, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and South America. Aviat relocated its corporate functions to Santa Clara from Morrisville, North Carolina, in June 2010.[3]
The company was founded on January 29, 2007 with the merger of Harris Corporation’s Microwave Communications Division and Stratex Networks and incorporated under the name Harris Stratex Networks.[4] The company renamed and rebranded itself to become Aviat Networks on January 28, 2010.[5]
With approximately 1,000 employees worldwide, the company's CEO is Mike Pangia, who was appointed as CEO on July 18, 2011.[6]

Customer profile and recent contracts[edit]
Aviat Networks customers include BT Group,[7] Africell,[8] Zain,[9] Optus,[10] Uninor,[11] Hormuud Telecom,[12] and Melita PLC.[13]
Recent customer contracts include:

As the primary supplier of mobile WiMAX equipment to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), the world’s seventh largest telecommunications service provider, Aviat helped supply India’s first urban mobile WiMAX network.[14]
Through its contract with MTS Allstream to build packet-based backhaul as part of its HSPA network, Aviat helps provides access to 97% of Manitoba, Canada’s population.[15]
Aviat’s NetBoss XT Network Management Solution for Lithuania Railway made possible the first-ever GSM-R implementation in the Baltic Region.[16]
Aviat has received orders worth $13 million for a combination of microwave backhaul equipment and services to support the State of Oregon's State Radio System.[17]

Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2009, Harris Stratex acquired Telsima, developer and provider of WiMAX Forum Certified products for use in next-generation broadband wireless networks, for $12 million. In September 2008, Harris Stratex announced a partnership agreement with Telsima for end-to-end 4G network solutions.[18]
Name and ticker symbol change[edit]
On January 28, 2010, at the opening of the Nasdaq trading session,[19] Harris Stratex Networks announced they have renamed their company to become Aviat Networks.[5] Along with the name change the company unveiled new corporate branding with a new company logo and relaunch of the corporate website. The company also changed their NASDAQ ticker symbol to AVNW. The new symbol begun trading on the morning of January 29, 2010, retiring the old HSTX; this date also marked the company's third anniversary since incorporation.
Advanced IP migration[edit]
Simultaneous to the brand launch, Xchange Magazine reported that Aviat was focusing in on aiding the carrier transition from legacy to all-IP and LTE networks, and helping operators reach rural and underserved areas with wireless broadband.[20] In support of these claims, Aviat announced a few weeks later at Mobile World Congress that it was adding cell site gateway functionality (normally provided by an external device) to the Eclipse Packet Node platform, making possible seamless TDM to IP backhaul migration. They explained that the gateway features were made possible by a plug-and-play Network Convergence Module (NCM), designed to fit in the Eclipse nodal indoor unit, giving wireless operators the choice to support legacy TDM traffic over an all packet backhaul network as an alternative to transporting TDM natively using a hybrid configuration.[21]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
