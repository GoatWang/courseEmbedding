John DeTore
John A. DeTore is the quantitative research director for GRT Capital and the portfolio manager for the United Alpha strategies. Mr. DeTore has been involved with investment management and research since 1983. He formed United Alpha, L.L.C. and started the United Alpha European Fund in 2003. His firm joined forces with GRT Capital Partners in 2006. 
Mr. DeTore's reputation as a leader in quantitative research and as a premiere product engineer is well established. His success began at Wellington where he conceived and built a quantitative research team over eight years into a very successful unit. Mr. DeTore created and managed two new successful products for Wellington before moving to Putnam in 1994. 
At Putnam Mr. DeTore built an impressive research and product engineering unit which designed seven products focusing on the international and small cap areas. These products grew to $10 billion in assets, and were strong performers at Putnam. Eventually this unit grew to 30 people and helped produce a remarkable performance and asset growth record. Mr. DeTore was a key figure in process design, risk control, investment strategy, personnel development and strategic management. He helped realign the smaller cap line-up and helped structure an initiative into international equities. 
Mr. DeTore holds a Master's degree in transportation from MIT where he also obtained his undergraduate degree. He is a long standing participant in various industry research and investment organizations such as the Boston Securities Analysts Society and AIMR. He is also a CFA charterholder.

About Us

Team Profiles

History

Our Philosophy





History
GRT Capital Partners, LLC was founded in 2001 by three senior portfolio managers dedicated to providing the best possible active equity management to institutions. These three managers, Rudolph Kluiber, Gregory Fraser and Timothy Krochuk were well acquainted with each other prior to starting their new venture. 
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Kluiber were college roommates at Harvard University ('82). They remained friends after graduation, and continued to swap stock insights and ideas for the next two decades. Mr. Krochuk and Mr. Fraser met at Fidelity Investments, where they worked together for nine years. Mr. Krochuk was first introduced to Mr. Kluiber by Mr. Fraser in 1994. 
Each of these three managers enjoyed a successful career in asset management. Driven by market conditions and the desire for more investment flexibility, the three managers launched their own Boston-based asset management firm in 2001. The firm, named GRT Capital Partners (for Greg, Rudy, and Tim), was registered with the SEC as an investment adviser in 2003.
