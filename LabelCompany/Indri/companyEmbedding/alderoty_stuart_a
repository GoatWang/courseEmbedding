					“Do your cattle get enough vitamin D?”			





 
Dr. Corwin Nelson, University of Florida
http://www.progressivecattle.com/topics/feed-nutrition/6981-do-your-cattle-get-enough-vitamin-d#.ViqCJL_rZQ4.email
 
This article recently appeared in the October 2015, issue of Progressive Cattleman.  Dr. Nelson reviews recent information on the need for vitamin D supplementation in beef cows and calves.  For newborn beef calves, Dr. Nelson recommends an injectable source of vitamin D at birth to build up vitamin D stores in the calf.  In the article, Dr. Nelson wrote “Even though the springtime sun will stimulate vitamin D production in their skin, it takes a couple of months to reach adequacy.  Based on experiments I have done, 200,000 I.U. vitamin D3 injected at birth will boost serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of calves to near 50 ng per mL”.  Dr. Nelson recommends products that contain at least 50,000 I.U. vitamin D per mL of product.
Besides vitamin D, VITAL E-Newborn from Stuart Products, Inc. also provides vitamin E and vitamin A for the newborn calf.  Each mL contains 500 I.U. vitamin E, 50,000 I.U. vitamin A and 50,000 I.U. vitamin D that has been proven to be biologically available to the calf.  Inject newborn calves with 5 mL at birth.

Rationale for EMCELLE®E-D3 LIQUID in drinking water for weaned pigs.

Fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E are each metabolized differently by pigs.
Fat-soluble vitamin status in pigs is very complex because metabolism of each fat-soluble vitamin is different in the pig.  Pigs have a dietary requirement for vitamin A and vitamin E since neither can be produced in the body, while vitamin D can be produced in pigs that have adequate access to sunlight.  Without adequate sunlight, vitamin D would then be required in the pig’s diet.
 
While nursing, pig’s vitamin E and vitamin A status are usually adequate, however vitamin D status is usually low due to low levels in sow’s milk.  What is interesting is that vitamin E status goes down very quickly after weaning because of lack of body stores. Pigs’, vitamin D status continues to be very low, and vitamin A status is not impacted by weaning, since vitamin A is stored in the liver.
 
Weaned pigs can not utilize feed-grade vitamin E.
University and field studies have shown that newly-weaned pigs
