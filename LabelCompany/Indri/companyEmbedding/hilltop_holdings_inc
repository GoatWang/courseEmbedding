The Hilltop Story | Hilltop Holdings

































The Hilltop Story





Led by West Texas native and highly regarded banker Gerald J. Ford, Hilltop Holdings Inc. officially entered the competitive Texas banking industry in December 2012 with the acquisition of PlainsCapital Corporation, a diversified financial services company with three operating companies: PlainsCapital Bank, FirstSouthwest (under PlainsCapital Corporation at the time of acquisition) and PrimeLending. The PlainsCapital acquisition transformed Hilltop’s strategic direction by giving it the opportunity to own a financial institution with a proven track record of success while equipping PlainsCapital with additional capital for future growth.
The acquisition brought together two of the state’s most successful and influential bankers—Gerald J. Ford and PlainsCapital Chairman Alan B. White. Both men were raised in West Texas and have decades of experience in banking. Ford is known for generating strong growth and profitability through acquisitions and sound bank management. White is an expert at generating organic growth within the PlainsCapital organization. Together, they provide a strong foundation for Hilltop as it seeks to become a premier Texas-based financial services company. White and Jeremy B. Ford now serve as Co-CEO's, with White serving as vice chairman overseeing Hilltop’s revenue generating operations comprised of PlainsCapital Bank, PrimeLending, Hilltop Securities Inc. and National Lloyds Corporation while Ford continues to serve as president overseeing Hilltop’s corporate functions, including: accounting and finance; risk and compliance; legal; corporate development; and corporate administrative areas.

Early History
Hilltop Holdings was founded in 1998 under the name Affordable Residential Communities Inc. (ARC) as a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in manufactured home communities. The company completed an initial public offering in 2004. In 2005, Gerald J. Ford, current Hilltop Holdings chairman, invested in ARC and joined the company’s board of directors.
In 2006, ARC revoked its election as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and announced the acquisition of National Lloyds Corporation (formerly NLASCO), a property and casualty insurance underwriter for low value dwellings.
In 2007, the company sold all of the assets used in its manufactured home communities business for $1.8 billion and changed its name to Hilltop Holdings Inc. In 2011, Hilltop made a $50 million loan to SWS Group, Inc., a Dallas-based financial services company offering retail brokerage, institutional brokerage, clearing services and banking.

The Right Opportunity
With approximately $600 million in cash mainly from the sale of the manufactured home business, Hilltop began pursuing opportunities to acquire an attractive banking institution. PlainsCapital’s financial strength and stability, experienced leadership, diversified business, strong Texas roots and national footprint made it a good fit for Hilltop. The PlainsCapital Corporation acquisition closed on November 30, 2012.
Founded in 1987 by Alan B. White, PlainsCapital Corporation has a long history of consistent financial growth. Under White’s leadership, PlainsCapital successfully acquired and integrated its three subsidiaries. White was also instrumental in developing PlainsCapital’s recognizable and sophisticated brand.

Momentum for Future Growth
Outside of the merger with PlainsCapital Corporation, Hilltop has also executed the acquisition of First National Bank of Edinburg in 2013 and SWS Group in 2015. Today, Hilltop Holdings offers a diverse range of services through its four primary subsidiaries, PlainsCapital Bank, PrimeLending, HilltopSecurities, and National Lloyds Corporation. PlainsCapital Bank is a leading commercial bank with locations throughout Texas. PrimeLending is a national mortgage provider focused on purchase mortgage originations. HilltopSecurities provides financial advisory, clearing, retail brokerage, and other investment banking services. National Lloyds Corporation is a niche property and casualty underwriting focused on homeowners insurance for low value dwellings. Hilltop Holdings seeks to build the premier Texas-based diversified financial services holding company through acquisitions and organic growth and using PlainsCapital Bank as its platform. 
























































A Firm Foundation | Hilltop Holdings

































A Firm Foundation





Hilltop Holdings seeks to generate shareholder value by building a premier Texas-based diversified financial services holding company through strategic acquisitions and organic growth, with PlainsCapital Bank as its platform.
Caliber of Leadership
Hilltop Holdings is led by West Texas native and highly regarded banker, Gerald J. Ford. Mr. Ford is the chairman of the board of Hilltop Holdings, Inc., a position he has held since 2007, as well as its largest shareholder. The PlainsCapital Corporation acquisition added PlainsCapital’s founder and chairman, Mr. Alan B. White to the Hilltop leadership team as vice chairman of the board and Co-CEO. Both Mr. Ford and Mr. White have worked in the banking industry since the 1970s. Jeremy B. Ford, president and Co-CEO of Hilltop along with White, has extensive experience with investments and acquisitions of banks, insurance and finance companies.
Acquisition Track Record
Gerald J. Ford is a banking and financial institutions entrepreneur who has been involved in numerous mergers and acquisitions of private and public sector financial institutions, primarily in the Southwestern U.S. over the past 40 years. Mr. Ford acquired and consolidated more than 19 banks from 1975 to 1993, forming First United Bank Group, Inc., a multi-bank holding company for which he functioned as chairman of the board and chief executive officer until its sale in 1994. During this period, he also led investment consortiums that acquired numerous financial institutions, forming in succession, First Gibraltar Bank, Federal Savings Bank, First Nationwide Bank and Golden State Bancorp. Mr. Ford served as chairman and CEO of First Gibraltar, First Nationwide Bank and Golden State Bancorp, as well as chairman of Pacific Capital Bancorp.
Diversified Business Model
Hilltop Holdings has four primary business units: PlainsCapital Bank (banking), PrimeLending (mortgage), HilltopSecurities (financial advisory), and National Lloyds Corporation (insurance). These translate into Hilltop’s four reportable business segments: commercial banking, mortgage origination, insurance and financial advisory.
Financial Strength and Stability
As of March 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, Hilltop had total assets of $12.3 billion, total deposits of $7.3 billion, gross loans HFI of $6 billion, and common equity of $1.9 billion.
Texas Focus
Texas is a business-friendly state with a resilient economy and a historically competitive banking industry. Hilltop companies operate approximately 120 locations in Texas giving it a substantial platform for growth in its home state where each of the Hilltop companies are headquartered.
Nationwide Presence
Hilltop’s established national presence sets the stage for acquisitions and organic growth outside of Texas as well. The Hilltop Holdings family of companies employs approximately 5,400 people in approximately 460 locations in 44 states and the District of Columbia.
