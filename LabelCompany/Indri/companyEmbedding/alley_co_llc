What We Do


Recognizing that each of our clients is unique, Alley Company customizes investment solutions for investor-specific needs.
We specialize in separate account equity and fixed-income investment management, where each client has his or her own separate account that is not co-mingled with any other assets.
To learn more about our customized investment solutions, please click on the categories below.

Comprehensive Portfolio Reports



Alley Company Core Equity Portfolio

					Our Core Equity investment objective is to compound long-term rates of return in a tax-efficient manner. To achieve this goal, we make U.S. large-cap equities the centerpiece investment for our clients. In customizing and managing large-cap equity portfolios, we focus on growth companies with proven track records, astute management teams and strong potential for sustainable growth.
				

Alley Company Dividend Portfolio

					Our Dividend Portfolio objective is to generate income and appreciation with dividend-paying equities. Since 1926, dividend income has accounted for more than one-third of the market's total return. Our investment philosophy focuses on the balance between attractive current yield and future dividend growth. We seek out companies with proven track records of dividend payout as well as strong balance sheets and durable competitive advantages in their businesses.
				

Asset-Allocation Programs

					In building and managing asset-allocation programs, we focus on risk-adjusted returns, and we offer access to most publicly traded asset classes and securities. Through asset allocation, we seek to increase overall return for a given degree of risk, or to reduce overall risk for a targeted level of return, depending on a client's needs. For asset allocation to produce successful risk-adjusted returns over any meaningful time frame, the right asset classes with the right properties must be blended together in the right proportions.
				

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

					Alley Company utilizes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to complement our proprietary products and to build out our asset-allocation programs. With the fast-growing ETF industry now offering more than 900 products, we engage in extensive analysis to determine which ETFs are appropriate for our investors. We focus on low-cost, liquid and tax-efficient ETFs that help us gain exposure to important asset classes such as small and mid-cap U.S. equities, international equities, and fixed-income. 
				

Other Customized Solutions

					Other customized investment solutions offered by Alley Company include careful management of concentrated stock positions and strategies for achieving a targeted level of portfolio income. Our expertise in the options market can facilitate the disposition/diversification of a concentrated stock position and can enhance portfolio income. We provide advice on any number of capital markets or financial-related matters specific to a client.
				

Comprehensive Portfolio Reports

					Alley Company uses an industry-standard management reporting system. This approach allows us to provide our clients with information regarding their total portfolio, including asset classes, performance measurement and cost basis reporting for tax accounting. We can provide consolidated reporting regardless of the number of custodians a client might have.

Strike Master is the first shuffle alley to have a dot matrix display like most modern era pinball machines. It was manufactured by Williams and uses pinball machine circuit boards as well. It is a very reliable machine and up to 4 players can play at once.

				We have several shipping methods to accomodate your needs. Here is an overview of the various options and pricing for common game room products. For all methods, the delivery address must be accessible to an 18 wheeler freight truck. If you need a smaller truck, please call us so we can make arrangements for you. Please inspect the items when they are delivered and report any damage to us in the presence of the shipper.

Shipping method definitions:

Liftgate delivery (curbside delivery)

Liftgate deliveries arrive with the item(s) on a pallet. For pinball machines the legs will be taken off and the backbox folded down. The driver will drop the pallet to the ground with a liftgate and is not required to move it beyond that point. Frequently, they will assist in bringing the pallet into your garage, but not always.

In-home delivery

With in-home delivery two men will bring the item inside, anywhere on the main level of your home or business. They are required to unpack the item(s) if you request them to. They will not, however, do any required assembly on the machines. If in-home delivery is selected for a pinball machine, we will typically leave it on its legs so all you have to do is flip up the backbox and plug in the machine.

Delivery and setup

If you select the Delivery and Setup option, the items will be delivered anywhere inside your home or business and any light assembly work will be done for you. The typical delivery will include two men, but more will be added if required.

Pricing:

Pinball machines and standard arcades:

Liftgate delivery - $399.00 + $300.00 each additional machine
In-home delivery - $599.00 + $400.00 each additional machine
Delivery and setup - $699.00 + $500.00 each additional machine

*Large machines may require additional charges
Delivery Times:

The Pinball Company, LLC makes no guarantee, expressed or implied, on the delivery time of any products sold. Any estimates given are subject to change and are dependent on time and method of payment, product availability, and turnaround times of shipping companies.

In general, items can take from a few days to a few weeks to deliver. New items that are in stock can typically ship right way, while refurbished items may need to be cleaned and tested before they are ready to ship. For the best estimate of shipping times for a specific item, please call and speak with a representative. Expedited delivery may be availiable.			

One Year Limited Warranty
Our One Year Limited Warranty, which includes new and refurbished products, covers telephone diagnosis and repair and replacement of defective parts for up to one year after you receive your machine. Our warranty also covers labor on the first service call within the first 30 days after you receive your machine. This warranty does not cover abuse or misuse or any item that is moved or repaired without authorization by The Pinball Company, LLC. The following products are excluded from any warranty: pinball machines and arcades made prior to 1990, any item being used in a non-residential setting, any item used at a rental property and items noted “as is” in the product description. Coin-mechanisms are not included with purchase of machines and are not covered by warranty.
