4

        4 Agenda 1)OFCCP Overview and Challenges 2)Prospecting and Recruiting 3)Creating Talent Pools 4)Best Practices for Diversifying Your Workforce







5

        5 OFCCP Compliance OFCCP/EEOC Compliance can be Daunting… How can you make this a more effective process for your organization? Do we have the right tools? Do we have enough time? Enough resources?







6

        6 OFCCP Recruiting Requirements Defining the Applicant (OFCCP “Internet Applicant” Definition) 1) The individual submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies; 2) The contractor considers the individual for employment in a particular position; 3) The individual’s expression of interest indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the position; and 4) The individual at no point in the contractor’s selection process prior to receiving an offer of employment from the contractor, removes himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicates that he or she is no longer interested in the position.” An individual must satisfy all 4 of the above criteria to be classified an Internet Applicant.







7

        7 When is an Applicant an Applicant? RecruitingTalent Pipelining / Prospecting Must adhere to OFCCP requirements No OFCCP implications Use of Applicant Tracking Tools Tools Unique to Creating Talent Pools / Communities Job adsSocial & Professional Networking …No Current Position(s) Posted The true difference between recruiting and prospecting







8

        8 The Process Flow Prospecting Focus StrategiesTools Talent Pools Recruiting Insuring Inclusion via Best Practices







9

        9 Prospecting Focus Prospecting Creates: Employment Brand and Awareness Competitive Intelligence Real-time Data for Trends - Shifts in Technology (obsolescence, new skills) - Dynamics in Compensation and Benefits - Workforce Mobility - Workforce Availability Increases Inclusionary Tactics for Diversity Does not require reporting for OFCCP; Does require documentation







10

        10 Building Talent Communities







11

        11 Strategies and Tools Using the right combination of prospecting strategies and tools can help: - Build your talent pools - Reduce overall time-to-fill - Reduce or eliminate reliance on agencies - Increase quality of hire - Reduce cost per hire - Increase hiring manager satisfaction These tools can be low / no cost and augment a good recruiters success rate An outreach plan needs to include: - Recruiters - College Presence - Diversity inclusion







12

        12 Strategies and Tools







13

        13 Affinity / Niche There are many examples of tools available to target needs within your WFP/AAP RecruitMilitary statistics: –Registered candidates: 447,000+ –Avg daily new registrants: 260 –Former enlisted: 82% –Former officer: 15% –Spouse: 3% –African-American: 21.4% –Hispanic: 9.2% –Female: 14.8% –Disabled Veterans: –10-30% disability rating: 51,300+ –30-60% disability rating: 17,100+ –60-90% disability rating: 6,000+ –100% disability rating: 1,500+







14

        14 Concerns Disclaimer(s) regarding the use of social media –Company landing sites are not job postings or solicitation of resumes –You are not expressing interest in a position but simply that of what the company says/does What information should be reviewed? How are sources documented?







15

        15 Framework Twitter Blogs LI Group Jigsaw Career Portal & CRM







16

        16 Business Case for Diversity & Talent Pools – Disabled Workers Costs of procuring and supporting agents are up to 25% less than brick-mortar based agents due to higher productivity, no facility or equipment charges and higher retention rates. According to research studies by CFI Group, Datamonitor, and IDC: Agent retention can be as high as 95% vs. 70% on average for facility-based call centers Quality of service provided by home workers is measurably higher by15% Home agents enjoy a $4000 annual “pay raise” due to costs avoided Quality and skill level of home agent is higher With 3rd party providers there is a guarantee of receiving college educated individuals. One third party provider indicates 95% of customer care agents are college degreed Home-agent can be a component of a corporate diversity strategy that includes people with disabilities, veterans, older workers and people living in rural areas 63% of disabled Americans are currently unemployed In some states, the government will reimburse a company via a tax credit up to 40% of the first year’s salary if a person with disabilities is given a permanent job Training time and associated “ramp” costs are reduced by 20-30% via use of effective E-learning capabilities. E-learning has shown to reduce training time by up to 30%. It does not require a facility or class set up time nor does it require a physical training staff. It can be quickly administered and can be rapidly expanded or changed to target the client or program Utilization of home agents is a “green” initiative and contributes to a reduction in urban congestion and pollution.







17

        17 Talent Pools and Recruiting At Home Workers – Check List Relationships matter, get to know resources and CBOs in your community Know your work, breaking it down allows for clear understanding Prepare the culture… Trust starts at home! Use a valid competency-based assessment tool as part of the hiring process to evaluate potential At-home agent candidates Utilize an At-home agent readiness checklist and ensure agents meet all of the criteria on the checklist. Audit them periodically for compliance Create a training program that addresses services, systems and general corporate information Provide remote agents the same training opportunities as premise-based staff Establish and document job responsibilities, requirements, procedures and policies Establish a formal communication process between supervisors and At-home agents Use “chat “for handling immediate agent inquiries. Supervisors need to be available to respond immediately to chat inquiries from agents Ensure that At-home agents have access to all product and service information, whether it’s online or paper-based Establish a defined number and frequency of quality monitoring sessions for At-home agent evaluations







18

        18 Best Practice #1 Financially Socially Regulatory Corporate Image Politically Bottom Line it’s the right thing to do Employing Disabled at Home Workers – Pays in Many Ways Graph Removed for Distribution Copy







19

        19 Best Practice 2: Establish Alumni Groups Retain knowledge base Redefines the employer-employee relationship Flexibility Fun Retains culture Taps into new markets Counters the baby-bust generation Retired Workers & Alumni Groups







20

        20 Best Practices #3 WFP and AAP linkage to a proactive prospecting plan Strong prospecting CRM Talent Communities with Robust Representation Creating a Demand/Pull Environment







21

        21 Basic Process WFP and AAP Sourcing Plan Channels CRM Invitation to Apply Recruiting & Tracking







22

        22 Introducing A Million Jobs for America At least 1 million jobs from businesses large and small will be distributed directly to the communities where the opportunities exist. Emphasis on distributing jobs to veterans groups, disabled individuals and state unemployment offices—to help the Americans who need our support the most. How quickly can we get America back to work? www.amillionjobs4america.com

Agenda OFCCP Overview and Challenges Prospecting and Recruiting Creating Talent Pools  Best Practices for Diversifying Your Workforce 

OFCCP Compliance OFCCP/EEOC Compliance can be Daunting… Do we have enough time?  Enough resources?  Do we have the right tools? How can you make this a more effective process for your organization?   

OFCCP Recruiting Requirements Defining the Applicant (OFCCP “Internet Applicant” Definition) 1) The individual submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies; 2) The contractor considers the individual for employment in a particular position; 3) The individual’s expression of interest indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the position; and 4) The individual at no point in the contractor’s selection process prior to receiving an offer of employment from the contractor, removes himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicates that he or she is no longer interested in the position.” An individual must satisfy all 4 of the above criteria to be classified an Internet Applicant.  

When is an Applicant an Applicant?  The true difference between recruiting and prospecting 

The Process Flow 

Prospecting Focus Prospecting Creates:  Employment Brand and Awareness  Competitive Intelligence   Real-time Data for Trends - Shifts in Technology (obsolescence, new skills) - Dynamics in Compensation and Benefits - Workforce Mobility - Workforce Availability  Increases Inclusionary Tactics for Diversity Does not require reporting for OFCCP; Does require documentation 

Building Talent Communities

Business Case for Diversity & Talent Pools – Disabled Workers Costsof procuring and supporting agents are up to 25% less than brick-mortar based agents due to higher productivity, no facility or equipment charges and higher retention rates.    According to research studies by CFI Group, Datamonitor, and IDC: Agent retentioncan be as high as 95% vs. 70% on average for facility-based call centers Qualityof service provided by home workers is measurably higher by15% Home agents enjoy a $4000 annual “pay raise” due to costs avoided  Quality and skill level of home agent is higher With 3rd party providers there is a guarantee of receiving college educated individuals. One third party provider indicates 95% of customer care agents are college degreed Home-agent can be a component of a corporate diversity strategy that includes people with disabilities, veterans, older workers and people living in rural areas  63% of disabled Americans are currently unemployed In some states, the government will reimburse a company via a tax credit up to 40% of the first year’s salary if a person with disabilities is given a permanent job Training time and associated “ramp” costs are reduced by 20-30% via use of effective E-learning capabilities.    E-learning has shown to reduce training time by up to 30%.    It does not require a facility or class set up time nor does it require a physical training staff.    It can be quickly administered and can be rapidly expanded or changed to target the client or program Utilization of home agents is a “green” initiative and contributes to a reduction in urban congestion and pollution. 

Talent Pools and Recruiting At Home Workers – Check List Relationships matter, get to know resources and CBOs in your community Know your work, breaking it down allows for clear understanding Prepare the culture… Trust starts at home! Use a valid competency-based assessment tool as part of the hiring process to evaluate potential At-home agent candidates Utilize an At-home agent readiness checklist and ensure agents meet all of the criteria on the checklist.  Audit them periodically for compliance Create a training program that addresses services, systems and general corporate information  Provide remote agents the same training opportunities as premise-based staff Establish and document job responsibilities, requirements, procedures and policies  Establish a formal communication process between supervisors and At-home agents  Use “chat “for handling immediate agent inquiries. Supervisors need to be available to respond immediately to chat inquiries from agents  Ensure that At-home agents have access to all product and service information, whether it’s online or paper-based Establish a defined number and frequency of quality monitoring sessions for At-home agent evaluations
