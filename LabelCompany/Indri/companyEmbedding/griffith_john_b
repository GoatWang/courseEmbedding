Outside Union Hospital, Wuhan (one of the biggest hospitals in China), stands an imposing copper bust of a Welshman, Griffith John. In 2016 the directors of the hospital are celebrating its founding by John, with a series of special meetings and exhibitions. In recent years, many Chinese Christians have visited Swansea to see for themselves the church which sent out the missionary who first brought the gospel to Central China.








John’s life was one of remarkable courage, adventure and blessing. Born in the slums of Swansea, orphaned as a result of cholera epidemics, he sailed for China with the London Missionary Society in 1855. Then in 1861 he moved to the great inland city, Hankou (now Wuhan), in the province of Hubei. He was the first Protestant missionary ever to settle in Central China, doing so eight years before the formation of the CIM by his great friend, Hudson Taylor. For fifty years he preached, wrote tracts and established churches. He remained in China during the many wars and rebellions that devastated the region in this period. He was the only Christian in the province when he arrived there, but God’s blessing on his ministry was such that when, gravely ill, he returned to Britain in 1911, he left behind him in the provinces of Hubei and Hunan many hundreds of Christian churches with a total membership of over 100,000 Christians.
His amazing and inspiring life deserves to be better known.








John Aaron, a retired physics teacher and school manager, is a member of Ebenezer, Swansea, the chapel from which Griffith John was sent out to China. He is married with two children and five grandchildren. He has produced several books on church history, including The Calvinistic Methodist Fathers of Wales, and is co-author of Travel through Wales: land of beauty and blessing.

"...exemplify leadership characterized by personal concern for the needs, training, development, and welfare of Soldiers and concern for families of Soldiers (FORSCOM Reg. 600-8, paragraph 1)." If an NCO meets these pre-requisites, the soldier may then be recommended by his non-commissioned officer chain-of-command to participate in the rigorous board examination process.Life Member Sergeant Morales ClubUnited States Army EuropeJune 1995The “Sergeant Morales Club” was established in 1973 by Lt. Gen. George S. Blanchard to promote the highest ideals of integrity, professionalism and leadership for the enlisted force serving in Europe.

We were so sorry to hear about the recent passing of Jack.  Butch Raffa called this past weekend to let us know.  Please know we will keep you and Jack's sons in our thoughts and prayers.  It certainly was a shock and 67 is just too young.
We had many great and fun times with Jack.  He and Fred rode to High School together and both always loved cars and racing.
We are still in FL so won't be able to be there for the service but please know we will be thinking of you and your family.

Sincerely,

Fred and LindaTony (Butch) Raffa and Jan RaffaRelationship: Long time high schooLinda,   we are so sorry to hear about the passing of our long time friend, Jack.
Condolences go to you and your family.  When we think of Belmont days, we certainly think of Jack, Fred Haughey, Butch Raffa and the late John Hinders.  We have a lot of fun memories that we will always cherish. 
With our deepest sympathy,
Butch and Jan Raffa
Joy HindersGloria toddRelationship: High School Friend What a great smile.  When I hear that Jack had passed, I began to recall those early days.  Jack was such a nice young man.  I always thought he had great hair and when I saw this photo I said, "Yes, that is the smile I remember."

It sounds like he turned out to be a fine man.  I spoke with some of your high school friends last night and we are all very proud to have called him friend.John "Jack" B.
