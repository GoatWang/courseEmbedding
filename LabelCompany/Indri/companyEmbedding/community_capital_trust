Impact Investing Since 1999






Positively Impacting Families and Communities in Need






Specializing in Sustainable Investing









Fixed Income Impact Investing
Community Capital Management (CCM) is a pioneer in managing fixed income impact investing and fossil fuel free portfolios.  We incorporate the “environmental” and “social” aspects of ESG investing into our investment philosophy by proactively screening market-rate bonds that positively contribute to economic and sustainable impact.
Our fixed income impact investing strategy is available via a mutual fund (CRA Qualified Investment Fund) and/or a separately managed account.  CCM also offers the strategy to banks for CRA investing and integrates impact investing analysis into its liquid alternative income strategy (CCM Alternative Income Fund) and within customized portfolios.
