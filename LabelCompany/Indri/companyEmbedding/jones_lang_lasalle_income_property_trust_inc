      Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our board of directors, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Maryland law.

Summary of Risk Factors
You should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in JLL Income Property Trust. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the following:

Since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock, repurchases of shares by us after a one-year minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares.
After a required one-year holding period, we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately 5% of our net asset value (NAV) per quarter and 20% of our NAV per annum. Because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests. Further, our Board of Directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. Because valuation of properties is inherently subjective, our NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day.
We are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor, which increases your risk of loss.
We have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.
Our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities, and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our NAV, which it is responsible for calculating.
The amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. We may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, or offering proceeds.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment.
If we fail to maintain our status as a REIT, and no relief provisions apply, we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our NAV.

Standard deviation reflects annualized standard deviation since October 1, 2012 for Class M and A shares and since July 1, 2014 for M-I and A-I shares. Standard Deviation measures the variation of returns around the average return from the investment over a given period of time. The higher the standard deviation, the greater the variance/volatility of the investment returns.

Summary of Risk Factors
You should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in JLL Income Property Trust. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the following:

Since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock, repurchases of shares by us after a one-year minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares.
After a required one-year holding period, we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately 5% of our net asset value (NAV) per quarter and 20% of our NAV per annum. Because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests. Further, our Board of Directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. Because valuation of properties is inherently subjective, our NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day.
We are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor, which increases your risk of loss.
We have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.
Our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities, and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our NAV, which it is responsible for calculating.
The amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. We may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, or offering proceeds.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment.
If we fail to maintain our status as a REIT, and no relief provisions apply, we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our NAV.

                Benefits of Real Estate
              


For decades, institutional investors have diversified their portfolios
with commercial real estate. JLL Income Property Trust empowers a
broader community of investors to access this cornerstone asset class
and compliment their portfolios with a range of benefits. 














          Performance
      






High-quality core commercial real estate as an asset class has
historically outperformed most other asset classes, delivering a 8.2%
annualized total return over the last 15 years ending in 2016. This
exceeded the returns on stocks and corporate bonds over the same
time period. 





      Historical Return Comparison (2001–2016)
    








      Sources: NCREIF, Standard & Poor’s, Citigroup, Federal Reserve. Real Estate (Private) is represented by the NCREIF ODCE gross total returns. NCREIF ODCE data reflects the returns of diversified, core, open-end funds including leverage and fund expenses, but excluding management and advisory fees. An investment in JLLIPT is different than the NCREIF ODCE, which is not an investable index. Like funds in the NCREIF ODCE, JLLIPT is a diversified, core, perpetual life commercial real estate investment alternative. Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index and are subject to market risk. Corporate Bonds are represented by the Citigroup Broad Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index and are subject to credit risk. T-bills are represented by the U.S. Government 90-day T-bill and are subject to interest rate risk. Government bonds and Treasury Bills are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Indices are meant to illustrate general market performance; it is not possible to invest directly in an index. The indices presented represent investments that have material differences from an investment in a non-traded REIT, including those related to investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, liquidity and tax treatment. 
    











          Potential Income
      






Income has been an essential component of the attractive long term total returns provided by commercial real estate as an asset class. Historically, 70% of the total returns from commercial real estate, according to the NCREIF Index, have come in the form of income rather than capital appreciation. Over the last 15 years, the annual income returns generated from investing in commercial real estate have been more than 2.5 times higher than stocks and lagged bonds by only 50 basis points.





      Historical Yield Comparison (2001–2015)
    








      Sources: NCREIF, Standard & Poor’s, Citigroup. Real Estate (Unleveraged) is represented by the NCREIF Property Index income minus capital expenditures yield. NCREIF data reflects the returns of a blended portfolio of institutional-quality real estate and does not reflect the use of leverage or the impact of management and advisory fees. Stocks are represented by the dividend yield for the S&P 500 Index. Corporate Bonds are represented by the bond yield to maturity for the Citigroup Broad Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index. The indices presented represent investments that have material differences from an investment in a non-traded REIT, including those related to investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, liquidity and tax treatment.
    











          Inflation Hedge
      






Real estate income over the last 25 years has increased at nearly the same average annual rate as inflation (2.92% vs. 2.31%). In contrast, bonds are a “fixed income” investment, which means the income they generate does not increase with inflation, exposing the investor to the risk that inflation will erode the value of future interest payments. Similarly, principal payments do not grow at maturity, whereas real estate may appreciate over time, especially during periods of high inflation. An investment in bonds differs significantly from an investment in commercial real estate, and bonds are considered to be a less risky investment than commercial real estate.





      Inflation and Real Estate Income Comparison (1992-2016)
    








      Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics, NCREIF. NCREIF data reflects the returns of a blended portfolio of institutional-quality real estate and does not reflect the use of leverage or the impact of management and advisory fees. Inflation is represented by the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers. Real Estate Income is the same-store NOI series of quarterly real estate income change. It is based on properties included in the NCREIF Property Index.
    











          Low Correlation
      






Modern portfolio theory suggests that the most effective way to maximize returns while at the same time minimizing risk is to add uncorrelated assets. Within the context of a multi-asset portfolio (composed of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes), commercial real estate may provide significant benefits, as correlations with stocks and bonds over time have been low.












      Please keep in mind that investing in real estate involves risk. Real estate is not traded on an exchange; therefore, transactions do not provide immediate liquidity and their pricing is less transparent than that of stocks. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other. The higher the co-efficient (1.00 is the maximum), the greater the correlation between the two markets. NCREIF ODCE data reflects the returns of diversified, core, open-end funds including leverage and fund expenses, but excluding management and advisory fees. An investment in JLLIPT is different than the NCREIF ODCE, which is not an investable index. Like funds in the NCREIF ODCE, JLLIPT is a diversified, core, perpetual life commercial real estate investment alternative. The indices presented represent investments that have material differences from an investment in a non-traded REIT, including those related to investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, liquidity and tax treatment.

Regarded as a hard asset, “brick and mortar” real estate may be especially appealing to investors whose confidence in financial assets has been shaken. While the ownership of hard assets may be reassuring, especially during periods of higher inflation, realizing the true value of these assets requires a long-term investment perspective.

CHICAGO, July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- JLL Income Property Trust, an institutionally managed, daily valued perpetual life REIT (NASDAQ: ZIPTAX; ZIPTMX; ZIPIAX; ZIPIMX), today announced the acquisition of Jory Trail at the Grove, a premier 324-unit apartment complex that is 95% leased. The Class A apartment property is located in the Portland, Oregon suburb of Wilsonville. The purchase price was approximately $75 million.



Wilsonville is a thriving suburb of Portland that features a robust apartment market, low market vacancy and no multifamily units under construction or planned in the submarket. The suburb is conveniently located along the I-5, providing access to some of greater Portland's major employment centers and is home to Xerox, Mentor Graphics, Rockwell Collins and Tyco. Wilsonville, which has attracted a growing population of affluent families, also offers an exceptional public school system that Niche.com and US News & World Report have ranked as a top school system both locally and nationally. Wilsonville's strong employment base and high barriers to entry should result in continued strong demand and future rent growth. 
"The acquisition of Jory Trail at the Grove demonstrates JLL Income Property Trust's strategy to invest in high-quality apartment assets in strong-performing areas featuring a combination of top incomes and school districts," said Allan Swaringen, President and CEO of JLL Income Property Trust. "Jory Trail is our first multifamily acquisition in the Pacific Northwest, and we continue to focus our apartment investment strategy on submarkets that showcase stability, growth and have high barriers to entry." 
This acquisition represents JLL Income Property Trust's ninth property investment in the apartment sector, bringing its aggregate apartment allocation to nearly $600 million and 25% of its overall property portfolio by valuation.
JLL Income Property Trust is an institutionally managed, daily valued perpetual life real estate investment trust (REIT) that gives investors access to a growing portfolio of commercial real estate investments selected by an institutional investment management team and sponsored by one of the world's leading real estate services firms.

Summary of Risk Factors
You should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in JLL Income Property Trust. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the following:

Since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock, repurchases of shares by us after a one-year minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares.
After a required one-year holding period, we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately 5% of our net asset value (NAV) per quarter and 20% of our NAV per annum. Because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests. Further, our Board of Directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. Because valuation of properties is inherently subjective, our NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day.
We are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor, which increases your risk of loss.
We have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.
Our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities, and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our NAV, which it is responsible for calculating.
The amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. We may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, or offering proceeds.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment.
If we fail to maintain our status as a REIT, and no relief provisions apply, we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our NAV.

Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. Key Developments

JLL Income Property Trust Acquires Premier Portland Apartments
Jul 20 17
JLL Income Property Trust announced the acquisition of Jory Trail at the Grove, a premier 324-unit apartment complex that is 95% leased. The Class A apartment property is located in the Portland, Oregon suburb of Wilsonville. The purchase price was approximately $75 million. Wilsonville is a thriving suburb of Portland that features a robust apartment market, low market vacancy and no multifamily units under construction or planned in the submarket. The suburb is conveniently located along the I-5, providing access to some of greater Portland's major employment centers and is home to Xerox, Mentor Graphics, Rockwell Collins and Tyco. Wilsonville, which has attracted a growing population of affluent families, also offers an exceptional public school system that Niche.com and US News & World Report have ranked as a top school system both locally and nationally. Wilsonville's strong employment base and high barriers to entry should result in continued strong demand and future rent growth.
