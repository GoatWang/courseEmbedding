                    that's water under the bridge for others brings a torrent 
                    of success to Kellogg alumni at Liquidity Services Inc.

By 
                    Kari Richardson
Class 
                    of 1995 graduates William P. Angrick III and Jaime Mateus-Tique 
                    credit the Kellogg School for a solid grounding in entrepreneurship. 
                    
While 
                    earning their MBA degrees, they worked through hands-on classes 
                    in new venture formulation and marketing new products, organized 
                    entrepreneurship conferences — a technology entrepreneurship 
                    conference Angrick helped found continues to this day — 
                    and participated in clubs organized around their shared interest.
Their 
                    management education also set the stage for a more elusive, 
                    but important, part of their present entrepreneurial success: 
                    a strong friendship and partnership. 
"Finding 
                    the right partner is one of the most important aspects of 
                    succeeding in business," Mateus-Tique says. "You 
                    simply cannot make it without that."
Today 
                    their 6-year-old company, Liquidity Services Inc., is a great 
                    success. According to its Web site, the Washington, D.C.-based 
                    firm, which specializes in helping businesses and government 
                    agencies dispose of obsolete and discontinued inventory, had 
                    revenues of $76 million for fiscal year 2004. It now employs 
                    some 300 people and encompasses 2 million square feet of warehouse 
                    space, becoming the fourth-fastest growing firm in America 
                    according to Entrepreneur Magazine.
The 
                    firm is getting noticed. The Ernst & Young Entrepreneur 
                    of the Year Award was recently granted to Liquidity's founders, 
                    including Benjamin Brown. Asad Haroon '88, the company's CMO, 
                    has also been a key contributor.
Upon 
                    graduation from Kellogg, Angrick, who is chairman and CEO, 
                    and Mateus-Tique, who is president and COO, followed their 
                    professors' advice to gain experience and build skills by 
                    joining a company before venturing out on their own. Angrick 
                    began his career as an investment banker working with high-growth 
                    e-commerce, and Mateus-Tique signed on as an associate with 
                    a large consulting firm, tackling supply chain and media issues.
After 
                    years working on their own, Angrick and Mateus-Tique found 
                    a way to combine their new media savvy and knowledge of business 
                    services in an entrepreneurial venture. The idea was to help 
                    businesses and government agencies manage the "reverse 
                    supply chain" — remarketing of retail customer 
                    returns, overstock products and unwanted inventory that can 
                    consume warehouse space and drain energy from moving finished 
                    goods through the firm's forward supply chain. 
With 
                    its online marketplaces, which include liquidation.com, 
                    govliquidation.com and uksurplus.com, the firm 
                    uses the Internet to match buyers and sellers in business-to-business 
                    transactions in much the same way eBay does with smaller-scale 
                    sales. But instead of bidding on one rare record or a used 
                    children's toy, the company's professional buyers typically 
                    compete for bulk quantities of items such as power tools, 
                    digital camcorders, printers or "any product sold by 
                    a big box retailer," Angrick says. The average sale on 
                    the sites totals about $1,000 and the typical quantity ranges 
                    from one pallet of goods to a truckload. 
Before 
                    and after online sale, Liquidity Services helps buyers and 
                    sellers manage their transactions by offering assistance with 
                    inbound shipping and storage, inventory inspection and organization, 
                    development of a sales or marketing plan, payment collection 
                    and outbound transportation.
"Before 
                    turning to Liquidity Services, many of our customers handled 
                    this process with paper and pencil and fax and spreadsheet," 
                    Angrick says. "We believe this new model is a best practice 
                    for corporations to manage products in the reverse supply 
                    chain."
The 
                    firm's online marketplaces attract buyers from 116 countries, 
                    who typically resell, refurbish or export their purchases 
                    — or turn around and sell them on eBay. Angrick estimates 
                    that about one-quarter of buyers are themselves the large-volume 
                    eBay entrepreneurs known as "Power Sellers."
All 
                    merchandise is sold on an as-is basis with Liquidity Services 
                    receiving a fee based on the gross merchandise sales value. 
                    Sellers remain confidential; Liquidity Services even offers 
                    to remove trademarks if a company wishes.
The 
                    bottom line, according to Angrick and Mateus-Tique, is that 
                    Liquidity Services' approach to selling unwanted inventory 
                    creates competition that benefits business and government 
                    alike.

Ladies & Gentlemen,
[REPOST FROM AUGUST 10, 2006]
Google Finance/Yahoo Finance/MSN Money/MarketWatch/CNN Money 
LQDT Liquidity Services Inc., is "a-pig-in-a-poke" be very careful, short term in and out trades only. [not recommended if any]. 
1) Government Liquidation Division expected to loose contract with GAO / DOD. 
a) Hundreds of complaints of intentional misrepresentation. Two-dozen at the BBB in Scottsdale, AZ., alone.
b) Scrap metal weight fraud.
c) Denial of customer security & recourse which has been standard in that industry for years [ref. e-bay buyer safeguards].
d) Allegations of "Boosting" auction prices through manipulation of their AUTO-BID feature.
e) State & Federal litigation line-ups
f) No checks and balances. 
2) These guys built the business model so they can get paid, not you. 
a) You should track "STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES" S.E.C.
b) William P. Angrick III cashed-out to the tune of 17-million-dollars shortly after going public! His "crew" did likewise.
c) As in most public offerings you have a  time of euphoria and then reality sets in. And, the rumor mill already has S.E.C opening a manila folder on them. 
If you've never bought IPO's before,LEARN. Take a step back and look at LQDT. There's nothing special about it. An office, a computer guy, a math major, a hungry marketer, and a money man. What REAL assets do they own? And, why did they need to go public? They've supposedly been functioning fine without the hundreds of millions of dollars their seeking. 
In my opinion, their biggest problems are yet to come. For if they already have hundreds of, (and I'll even say alleged) victims, and that's just with the Government Liquidation Division... 
Sincerely, and again be careful they are poised to make money not you. For ten-thousand-dollars and a couple of employees, you could be doing the same thing, probably better, and without the fraud. 
I hope you find my comments helpful. If you know of a blog or other individuals with similar concerns, I'd like to talk with them. maybe we can help each other.  
Note: The beltway inside favorite to take the GAO/DOD contract is Maximus Inc.
Feel free to respond.

										 0Author 1Consumer 0Employee/Owner    Updates & Rebuttals     #1 Consumer Comment  Satisified with Liquidity Services AUTHOR: Merle -  (U.S.A.) SUBMITTED: Tuesday, May 01, 2007 POSTED: Tuesday, May 01, 2007  
														I am resonding to "Albert" in Columbus, Georgia. 
Albert, 
I am a satisfied customer, and investor in Liquidity Services.   
Apparently the Department of Defense is satisfied as well.  I have yet to see any information backing your baseless claim that Liquidity is going to lose that contract.   
Many large publications also preach the successes of Liquidity; maybe you should pick up an "Entreprenour" magazine once in a while. 
Most online stock rating organizations also label Liquidity as a "strong buy".  You made the claim 7 months ago that the SEC is opening a "manilla folder" on Liquidity.  I have seen no evidence of this either. 
After reading your comments, it makes me wonder which category you fall in to: 
1)  An investor who bailed when the stock fell, and you're now angry because you don't know how to read the market. 
or, 
2)  A customer who was outbid for a product; or a customer who successfully bought something from Liquidity.  Many items are sold "As Is", and are not functional.  Perhaps you failed to read that part of the contract. 
A third possibility is that you are just a jealous nobody who is angry that someone else, through hard work and education, saw a business possibility and made it into a success. 
Regardless of which type of moron you are,  I fail to see how advocating someone's murder is appropriate. 
I can't believe that the editors of this report allowed your idiotic rant to be posted.  I hope Mr. Angrick and his attornies are taking appropriate action, and will be adding to his fortune due to your stupidity.													   Respond to this report!  What's this?
