Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. is a diversified gaming and entertainment company whose operations consist of the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino and Dover Downs Raceway. Dover Downs Hotel & Casino is comprised of a 165,000 square-foot video lottery (slots) casino complex and an adjoining hotel featuring luxury accommodations with conference, banquet, fine dining, ballroom and concert hall facilities. Dover Downs Raceway is a harness racing track with pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races.
We offer a unique gaming and entertainment experience and make available to our patrons a number of different options including slot machine gaming, live harness horse racing, fine dining, national recording acts and comedians, live boxing, and simulcasting of thoroughbred and harness horse races from across the United States.
Our mission is to provide all of our customers a premier gaming and entertainment experience with a focus on quality customer service. Our growth strategy is to foster customer loyalty by following this mission, concentrating on our most valuable customers, enhancing our gaming products with additional entertainment offerings, and creating an exciting gaming environment while focusing on areas that we believe will increase our revenue and profitability.
Our casino opened in December 1995 with approximately 500 slot machines. Because of its popularity, the casino has expanded five times since its opening and the number of machines has increased steadily to its current level of nearly 2,500. In June 2007, the Company broke ground on "The Colonnade," an extensive casino expansion project that added almost 70,000 square feet and made room for approximately 500 additional slot machines, three restaurants, retail outlets, Sweet Perks Too, and Fire & Ice at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino -- an upscale lounge/nightclub with seating for 200 guests.
Our luxury hotel facility, located adjacent to the casino, includes 500 guest rooms and suites, indoor pool and fitness room, a multi-purpose ballroom/concert hall and a fine dining restaurant. The hotel was awarded the AAA Four-Diamond award again this year. The Company expanded its hotel to add 268 well-appointed rooms and a full-service, 6,000-square-foot luxury spa, Toppers Spa/Salon. Upon completion of the expansion in fall 2007, the hotel became the largest in Delaware with 500 rooms.
Dover Downs Raceway has presented live harness racing events since 1970. The track is adjacent to our casino and hotel. Live harness races conducted at Dover Downs Raceway are simulcast to tracks and other off-track betting locations across North America on each of the Company's live race dates. Our races currently are transmitted to more than 400 tracks and off-track betting locations.
Dover Downs Raceway also has facilities for pari-mutuel wagering on both live harness horse racing and on simulcast thoroughbred and harness horse racing, which is received from numerous tracks across North America.

Love to stay here for a casino trip. Easy access to your choices of fantastic eating, casino fun and a great room to lie down to rest in between! We normally come here with family and friends on a bus that we schedule for a weekend trip. The hotel staff takes care of getting your luggage to the room and gives the room key to you so you can start enjoying your visit right away.

Driving back from Maryland decided to spend a night there. Compared to other casino hotels we have stayed at , it had a great value. Rooms quiet clean and comfortable. Wife loved the shower. Extra security as you need your room key to ride elevators up to room level. Casino was well laid out and we did surprisingly well. Overall a very nice visit we will go back

This is a beautiful casino and hotel. We have stayed there several time in the past and it has always been a pleasant trip. The room was clean and comfort although I am not one that likes starchy sheets I prefer sheets that are less stiff, the sheets didn't bother my wife just me. The casino is beautiful with lots of slots and other games but the odds of winning were slim.

“Fun Get-Away”


Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




Dover Downs is a great overnight or weekend get-away, especially if you live between Northern VA and NYC as it is a easy drive. While it is a casino, if you are like me and not a true gambler, you can still have a great time. The casino is HUGE with a variety of machines and table games; Poker is secluded on another floor. There are plenty of cash out kiosks so that you don't have to go to a window and stand in line. While there are ladies walking around with beverages, there are also free self-serve beverage dispensers. There is a huge and very nice bar on the floor along with a spacious entertaining area with comfortable seating and a live band every night. There is also a dance floor. There are several restaurants on the floor as well. They have karaoke and a DJ at the Oyster House restaurant, which is also on the floor. The DJ WAS GREAT!!! The music was so good, gamblers left the machines and were dancing in the aisles! For you gamblers, no worries, these non-gambling activities will not distract your flow as they are all on the sides of floor. The resort also has a nice spa. In addition to the game floor restaurants, there is a buffet and a more upscale restaurant, Michele's. Both the regular buffet restaurant and Michele's have Sunday brunch. Again, Michele's offers more upscale options, including organic. Spring for Michele's ; you will not regret it! The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, as are the bathrooms. The lobby of the restaurant is large and welcoming and houses shops and a bakery. Dover Downs also has a race track and they host big named acts in their theatre. If you want to go off-site, there is plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area. Lastly, the staff is excellent! They are professional, courteous and truly want the guest to have a great time, Melinda and Dunika, Front desk mgrs, are GREAT! Seek them out and they will take care of you. Be sure to try the amazing sweets created by Anida, the Pastry Chef, at Michele's, as she is certainly talented. And one of the people that keeps all departments running smoothly so that guest have anything they need and an enjoyable time, is Doree, Sr. Director, Operations; she is great! This team of leaders at Dover Downs brings the welcome and warmth to hospitality. Treat yourself to a get-away and experience it.

“looking tired”


Reviewed 1 week ago




Spent the night at Dover Downs and Casino this weekend. We usually visit once or twice a month. It's a nice drive up the eastern shore and we like to stop for fresh produce at the road side stands on the way home during the summer months.We have a nice time during our stay, but the hotel rooms are really showing their age. Think they are overdue for a little TLC. The carpet in our room was dirty, stained and obviously patched. The tub wasn't very clean; lots of hair in the tub. The non-smoking room smelled a little like smoke. We notified the front desk only to let them know so we wouldn't be charged for cleaning. They offered to send housekeeping in to spray or move us, but we didn't want to move (we just wanted to get settled and get a bite to eat). We had some spray and sprayed the room ourselves. The room was fine for one night, but think if improvements aren't made, they will start to lose business. The staff are friendly, helpful, and sincere. The casino is fun; some new machines, the old standard machines, plenty of open table games. The Garden Café is good for a meal and the Festival Buffet is good for breakfast. They have a decent sports book restaurant which is nice for sandwiches, pizza and drinks. Michelle's, their fine dining restaurant, is constantly very good.

Your feedback is valuable to us and we appreciate your comments regarding aspects of the hotel that need updating. I am happy to tell you that we will be "refreshing" the property and I am sure you will be very pleased with the updates. While some instances of wear and tear are understandable, anything other than a spotlessly clean room, is not. I am sorry that you experienced this deficiency in service.

“Dover Downs -great place to play and have fun”


Reviewed 5 days ago
NEW 



Dover Downs is one of the best, if not the best casino in the area. Definitely has a Vegas feel that makes each trip exciting and enjoyable. Rooms and suites in the hotel are beautifully appointed andreflect careful attention to cleanliness and comfort from housekeeping staff. Rooms with spas offer a relaxing break from gaming and again have been scrupulously clean.The buffet is of premium quality with an assortment of food that can meet any dietary needs. Their themed meals are authentic and show great prowess in the skill of the chefs and dining staff.My wife, our cousins and close friends have enjoyed our trips and stays here and would encourage anyone looking for a great atmosphere, good gaming, and excellent service to give Dover Downs a try

not to sure about why dover downs seems to be losing its friendliness and customer appreciation. I used to really feel like part of a family now it seems to have lost its reason for really being there for customers.

“Fun casino”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago

This is one of our favorite casinos, we always have a good time here. Security guards do seem to follow you around more here, Heaven forbid you want to stop and look in your purse for something or give a family member some money. But I guess that's their job.The bar staff are very nice, I think the bar is called the Gazebo Bar.

Driving back from Maryland decided to spend a night there. Compared to other casino hotels we have stayed at , it had a great value. Rooms quiet clean and comfortable. Wife loved the shower. Extra security as you need your room key to ride elevators up to room level. Casino was well laid out and we did surprisingly well. Overall a very nice visit we will go back

“Stop over to Atlantic City”


Reviewed 1 week ago




This is a beautiful casino and hotel. We have stayed there several time in the past and it has always been a pleasant trip. The room was clean and comfort although I am not one that likes starchy sheets I prefer sheets that are less stiff, the sheets didn't bother my wife just me. The casino is beautiful with lots of slots and other games but the odds of winning were slim.

“Fun Get-Away”


Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




Dover Downs is a great overnight or weekend get-away, especially if you live between Northern VA and NYC as it is a easy drive. While it is a casino, if you are like me and not a true gambler, you can still have a great time. The casino is HUGE with a variety of machines and table games; Poker is secluded on another floor. There are plenty of cash out kiosks so that you don't have to go to a window and stand in line. While there are ladies walking around with beverages, there are also free self-serve beverage dispensers. There is a huge and very nice bar on the floor along with a spacious entertaining area with comfortable seating and a live band every night. There is also a dance floor. There are several restaurants on the floor as well. They have karaoke and a DJ at the Oyster House restaurant, which is also on the floor. The DJ WAS GREAT!!! The music was so good, gamblers left the machines and were dancing in the aisles! For you gamblers, no worries, these non-gambling activities will not distract your flow as they are all on the sides of floor. The resort also has a nice spa. In addition to the game floor restaurants, there is a buffet and a more upscale restaurant, Michele's. Both the regular buffet restaurant and Michele's have Sunday brunch. Again, Michele's offers more upscale options, including organic. Spring for Michele's ; you will not regret it! The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, as are the bathrooms. The lobby of the restaurant is large and welcoming and houses shops and a bakery. Dover Downs also has a race track and they host big named acts in their theatre. If you want to go off-site, there is plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area. Lastly, the staff is excellent! They are professional, courteous and truly want the guest to have a great time, Melinda and Dunika, Front desk mgrs, are GREAT! Seek them out and they will take care of you. Be sure to try the amazing sweets created by Anida, the Pastry Chef, at Michele's, as she is certainly talented. And one of the people that keeps all departments running smoothly so that guest have anything they need and an enjoyable time, is Doree, Sr. Director, Operations; she is great! This team of leaders at Dover Downs brings the welcome and warmth to hospitality. Treat yourself to a get-away and experience it.

“looking tired”


Reviewed 1 week ago




Spent the night at Dover Downs and Casino this weekend. We usually visit once or twice a month. It's a nice drive up the eastern shore and we like to stop for fresh produce at the road side stands on the way home during the summer months.We have a nice time during our stay, but the hotel rooms are really showing their age. Think they are overdue for a little TLC. The carpet in our room was dirty, stained and obviously patched. The tub wasn't very clean; lots of hair in the tub. The non-smoking room smelled a little like smoke. We notified the front desk only to let them know so we wouldn't be charged for cleaning. They offered to send housekeeping in to spray or move us, but we didn't want to move (we just wanted to get settled and get a bite to eat). We had some spray and sprayed the room ourselves. The room was fine for one night, but think if improvements aren't made, they will start to lose business. The staff are friendly, helpful, and sincere. The casino is fun; some new machines, the old standard machines, plenty of open table games. The Garden Café is good for a meal and the Festival Buffet is good for breakfast. They have a decent sports book restaurant which is nice for sandwiches, pizza and drinks. Michelle's, their fine dining restaurant, is constantly very good.


Room Tip: The racetrack view is nice. It's fun to watch the horses practice and race for a little diversi...

“Pretty much like other casinos”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago




I am a dabbler gambler and don't spend gobs of time in casinos but have been in enough to say this one is perfectly average. Nothing special but gets the job done. The layout is a bit of a sprawl and the service was fine. Have seen worse, have seen better. If you want to idle your time and gamble, this is a perfectly serviceable local place to do it.

I've not stayed in the hotel part since I live in Dover but I've gone to the casino a few times and I must say. Great casino, clean, lots of games, slots and tables and out of the few times I've been, I won some money on the slots more than I've lost. Might be my luck but I've walked away with $90 one time and $130 another so I'm loving this casino. The ambience is beautiful and it is decorated nicely for each holiday. During Christmas season they had a huge and gorgeous Christmas tree decorated in white ornaments. I loved it. Not dated looking at all. They've got around 20 different restaurants as well







The room was large and clean and the sleets weren't cringeworthy. The casino was popular with a variety of people of all ages, genders and races. I find it disheartening that the most racially diverse place I've visited in months is a loud bastion of clanks and clangs which visit luck to few and tragedy to many. 

The breakfast foods lacked quality I am used to in foodie capital PDX. The bagels lacked tooth and the. Breakfast pastries. Looked Costco ish. 

I was sorry to miss the horse racin that might have been more fun than this wasteland.







My husband did the Rusty Wallace NASCAR driving experience. It is not cheap but it is very well run and the employees are fun friendly and knowledgeable. We had a beautiful day for it too. Don't go hungry because there is no food available once you're at the track. Don't pay extra for the Go Pro video... it's just audio of the track in front of you as you're driving. DO bring 50 extra bucks to buy the official picture they take of you and put in an official looking frame. All in all a fun experience.







I would give this hotel experience 2.5 as it was just ok for me. I stayed here for two nights and I must say I was soo glad to get home and sleep in my own bed!! 

I liked that the hotel offered plenty of parking, I ended up getting a spot very close to the hotel. When I checked in, the staff was nice but seemed very inexperienced about their job. The lady asked for my debit card to put a hold on the room and without me realizing she even charged me for my two nights upfront without my authorization! Then when I told her I wanted to pay in cash they told me I had to wait until the next morning  ( ughh) 

So the next morning I asked them to reverse the charges so I can pay in cash and they acted like they didn't want to do it! Overall I ended up having to call my bank and they immediately removed the charges from my account! Hahaha meanwhile the lady staring at me like a dear in headlights! (and I sighs)

So after that fiasco was over I felt much better however I wasn't that impressed by my room, although it was spacious and offered great amenities, the bathroom to me could of used some remodeling. I don't know if it was me but my shower had two heads the handheld and the regular and for some reason the water only worked from the handheld that was in the corner of the shower ughh and the water came out so hard! and I can't forget that my hotel room carpet had stains on it! 

Now let's get into the casino, so the hotel offers a casino and I liked that the entire casino was smoke free and the machines and area was neat and clean!! However I  didn't like that the casino didn't really have a good variety of dining options, I just wasn't impressed by any of the restaurants they had to offer plus the food was on the pricey side.

Overall I came for a two day conference which was paid for by my company so I can't get mad at that, however I would not come back to stay overnight at this hotel it's just not worth it to me!







Possibly the worst service in the history of hospitality! Stay at a Red Roof... its an improvement!







I liked Dover Downs Hotel and Casino because it's a nice conference center without being huge-- it's not ultra plush or a luxury resort, but a nice hotel at a casino.  Comparing it to the local resort and convention center at National Harbor, it's a reasonable size as the Gaylord at Nation Harbor is ridiculously BIG.  You have to trek a mile to get the the check in counter.  Ask about the nearest bathroom, they'll tell you downstairs and across a football field.   Here at Dover Downs, it's spacious, but everything is in a decent proximity.

The rooms are between really nice and standard.  The rooms are currently smoke free, but it's obvious from the smell embedded in the walls and carpet that it was formerly a hotel that allowed smoking.   The hotel is aging a bit, but it's still comfortable.  I had great sleep. 

Dover Downs is also located on a strip that has everything from Friday's to Ruby Tuesdays, Noodles and Company, Olive Garden, Coldstone Ice cream and more.  I didn't visit the shops at the hotel and casino, but there are plenty of stores around to suit your needs.  

I'm not a casino person, but I will be back if I'm offered to go.







Dover Downs is a nice destination for a weekend getaway. I recently went up for the weekend from the Washington, DC area, and I was pleasantly surprised. There is so much to do right there on the grounds that you don't even need to venture out.

The hotel is nice. Lots of rooms and clean.  I'm not a fan of hotels, but when I stayed here, I didn't feel apprehensive about it. However, the hotel is starting to show a little age so with all the money they collect, maybe an upgrade is in the works.

On top of that, the casino itself is awesome. An entire floor of games that really do pay off! From slots to the tables, take your pick!  Then when you're ready to take a break, you can go to any of the complimentary drink stations or one of the many restaurants that are right off to the side of the casino floor. In conclusion, I had a lot of fun at Dover Downs and that's why I'm a fan.







Community casino. Free wifi and self serve soft drinks. Table games and slots.

Always a friendly crowd and never too crowded. They have some fun food and shopping options (buffet, burgers) if you're looking for other things. I think they do shows regularly too but haven't been to one in a while here. 

Plenty of parking and lots of shopping and eating nearby (need to drive to).







Just alittle update that been meaning to write that everybody at Dover Downs has been very very Nice to me and I just want to thank all the nice girls that work the front desk they really do try to give there customers what they want! Only thing I want to complain bout is the new Check out time which is not there fault! Not really sure why they changed it I have been told 3 different stories! But in my opinion I think if you are E-lite card holder you should still get a noon check-out! Gold and Silver cards 11 check -out! That way that gives them something to work on to become a Black card member!! That hour makes big deal if you are up playing till 3:30 or 4:00 in morning!! I sure hope that the casino doesn't start changing things to much because I would hate to see them lose anymore customers due to the fact so many Casinos! I live 10 mins from MD.LIVE Casino but I choose to come to Dover to play and have Fun!! But I hear a lot of people gonna be going to MGM Casino opening on Dec.8th I sure hope that it doesn't affect Dover Casino! And people will still come to support a smaller town Casino! Because they do go out and above on a lot of Events they give to there card members! Just like this past weekend the Octoberfest they had!! Omg very very nice! Food was delish! And the hats were a cute touch!! They gave beer mug and took your picture too! They had a German band that played the Chicken Dance!! Lol lol everything was clean and set up Beauiful!! I was also at Crabfeast in Aug this year! Very nice affair! I wrote review under the Festival Buffet! All in All come to Dover Downs to Have fun and employees know me and I always have a good time when I am there! Cause you know Life Too Short not to enjoy yourself while you can!! While everybody is going to MGM I will be spending my free time in Dover Downs Casino! I have met so many nice customers that live local and meet up with them when I am there! And so many great employees that I love to talk too when I am there too! Oh and the Rooms are always so nice and clean and the maids work hard to keep them that way! Keep up the good work Dover Downs and see ya all real Soon!!!!







Why is my beef still alive?? The only thing colder than this was our service!! Avoid the buffet at all costs!!







**This review is specifically for the hotel.**

We stayed here for the NASCAR race and since it is on track property, it is very convenient. It is a full
service hotel and casino with room service, a spa, fitness center, pool, restaurants, and shopping. 

They need a renovation badly. Our room was disgusting- there were visible stains all over the carpet, furniture and walls. Luckily I had flip flops so I wasn't walking around with my bare feet. 

The beds were highly uncomfortable. They only had doubles left so my boyfriend and I shared a bed one night and tried our own beds another night. They were so soft and creaked every time you rolled over. 

The shower was not a pleasant experience either. It's hot or cold and the shower head had the worst spray. 

Two stars for convenience: proximity to track and room service till 1am.

Note that this track is in the middle of town and there are plenty of other hotels down the street as well.







We visit every time we are in Dover.  The casino is cool and fun.  They serve complimentary sodas.  There are a few restaurants in the casino.  Security has a strong presence and they are quite nice.







We had our wedding here and it was an awesome time. This is the nicest venue in Dover for a big wedding because the resort has everything for a diverse crowd. Our guests enjoyed the five star restaurant Michelle's and also all the other restaurants. They went to the spa. But most importantly, they loved that they could gamble. At weddings there is often a lot of downtime so that gave them something to do.

We needed a large space because we had a traditional Indian wedding and the ballroom fit the bill. We also had the rehearsal dinner in the Kent Room and that was wonderful (the Kent room can have up to 50 people.) The event coordinator was excellent. She was extremely patient in listening to us and accommodating all our needs. She was so good, in fact, that we didn't need to hire a wedding planner. 

This is a great place to bring out of town guests or to stop by on your way down to the beach. Dover Downs is not just a place for Nascar. It's a fun place to gather with friends and family.







Poker Room. Thu 9:00 AM. 16 tables. No players. Looks very clean. Smoke free. Beyond that, can't say.







I stayed overnight at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino on March 24th for a food show. Since I booked my reservation at the last minute I almost didn't get a room, but the woman in reservations helped me get a room (and I got the group rate for being part of the food show!).

This is a great hotel for business purposes. My hotel room was huge and included the most comfortable bedding, free WIFI, flat screen t.v., desk, and a huge spa-like bathroom with luxurious toiletries. The room was very soundproof and I slept like a baby that night. 

The following morning I was able to make my way downstairs for breakfast and I ordered a coffee, breakfast sandwich, and a fruit cup for under $10 at Sweet Perks Cafe. (Since I did not have a car I was very grateful to have this cafe onsite so that I did not have to eat from a mediocre buffet or pay $25+ for room service.) 

My only complaint was that although the bath towels in my room felt heavenly they left lint EVERYWHERE. I had lint on my skin, in my hair, all over my clothes... it was a complete mess! 

Other than the towels my stay at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino was terrific!







It's nice that this is a nonsmoking facility. Well organized with self serve drink fountains. Actually a pretty nice and glowing design for a casino.







WHOA!!!!!! PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU CONSIDER!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For a quick summation: AWFUL- just make the trip to Atlantic City!!!!!

If you are looking for a Hotel / Casino experience this is NOT THE PLACE AT ALL......It is EXTREMELY MISLEADING if you go by the website which makes it look beautiful! 

We booked through Travelocity which listed terrific amenities and photos made it look like (and referred to it as) a LUXURY hotel. In reality, it is on the side of the road with our view from our "upgraded" 10th floor room being that of the shopping center across the street and parking lot.SIMPLY PUT: Health concerns prevented us from enjoying BASICS that EVERY decent hotel has!!!!!!!!!!! The website and everything else promoting this "hotel and casino" as 
luxurious on website (jacuzzi and pool......both of which were incredibly FILTHY......not just dirty but YEARS of neglect were clear from the pictures you can see the LITERAL RING AROUND THE TUB!!!!!! The "jacuzzi" was the size of a regular bathtub so it would be an extremely intimate experience if you DARED to go in but honestly, it was all FOAMY from people using it as their personal cleansing bathtub and/or no cleaning/maintenance. 

My sister and I LITERALLY would not even put our FEET in it to see how it felt !!!!

We wanted to swim but the pool was only 3 feet (no big deal there) but it was SMALL - the size a jacuzzi should be, lol..........and it was DIIIIIIIIIIIRTY- again - years of neglect: MOLDY!!!!!

I honestly do not know how they stay open due to the HEALTH VIOLATIONS!!!!!!

The buffet made BOTH my sister and I SICK so that HAD to be from the awful food (animals were fighting over crab legs that were dry tasting and since no crackers were given you had to use your hands like a caveman !!!!!) 

The gym that smelled of cat spray (of all things, oddly enough???) prevented us from our daily workout.  REPULSIVE!

Again, if we KNEW the hotel was so horrendous I would have booked us at the Hilton across the street where we are members of HiltonHonors and even so.......thinking about it, the poorly lit dangerous parking lot and clientele would not even make it worth it.We will NEVER return; in fact we are embroiled in a battle to get a refund or at least reduction due to the fact that we were not able to use the jacuzzi, pool or gym (FILTH!!!). 

We were absolutely horrified upon pulling up and seeing that this was an outdated, filthy building among TJ Maxx, Target, Super Cuts, etc. and MOST IMPORTANTLY- do NOT risk your health and safety. That's the bottom line. If we lived closer I don't think I'd even go!  It is really that bad.

I will say one nice thing: they have one good machine that my sis and I had a ball with and we had a good laugh about the fact that it was SOOOOOOOOO bad..... we just had to laugh! It was sooo outrageous when we were comparing the website pix to the reality. It is so dirty and the best part (SARCASM dripping off that word "best") was that upon checkout, the "supervisor" of the desk (whatever that means) was NASTY when we simply asked for our folio (bill broken down).  She simply took out a calculator and showed us 209 (advertised price) plus taxes plus $50 incidentals fee.  She said "you ain't got no incidentals so that will fall off" ........ well we shall see if that happens. I doubt it.

My sister is writing to the DE department of health and to the board or CFO- trying that hard because it was THAT bad........ I can't believe this joint is still operating !!!!!! It is struggling apparently (all found out after our last minute choice to stay there after seeing it was on our way home and it looked awesome on website, lol) ...... talk about CATFISH!!!!!!!!!!!

This was like having a dating profile with a Taylor Swift picture and you meet a smelly man instead.

I HAVE PICTURES OF FILTHY AREAS- I CAN'T POST THEM????? WHY?????? I do not know how to post pics :( I will find out then add them.......promise. I don't want anyone else getting sick and ripped off, adding insult to injury!







I have just returned from a weekend at Dover Downs.  I stayed there a few years ago, and had no complaints.  This time as a guest, I felt like I was staying at a moderate level hotel.  We had two rooms, both were not clean.  Carpets were not swept, crumbs in the sheets, water marks in the toilet bowls, etc.  We were comped for dinner buffet for our inconvenience.  The buffet was very good and we were both happy.  Within 12 hours we were both sick.  We both ate the crab and shrimp.  
We ate at the Garden Cafe for breakfast.  My friend was happy with her meal. I personally was disappointed to be served frozen pre-seasoned home fries, overly salty Canadian bacon for over 10 a plate.  My friend had the pancakes and they looked very good.
It used to be a nice place to go.  Now it is not.







Slots were very tight! But good music, cheap drinks, good service, not too crowded and smoke free







What a beautiful place to hold an event. I went here for a Scottish Rite event and the food and staff were excellent. I would definitely recommend to others for holding large group parties or events. It also helps that the drinks at the casino bar are reasonably priced and strong.

I've not stayed in the hotel part since I live in Dover but I've gone to the casino a few times and I must say. Great casino, clean, lots of games, slots and tables and out of the few times I've been, I won some money on the slots more than I've lost. Might be my luck but I've walked away with $90 one time and $130 another so I'm loving this casino. The ambience is beautiful and it is decorated nicely for each holiday. During Christmas season they had a huge and gorgeous Christmas tree decorated in white ornaments. I loved it. Not dated looking at all. They've got around 20 different restaurants as well

The room was large and clean and the sleets weren't cringeworthy. The casino was popular with a variety of people of all ages, genders and races. I find it disheartening that the most racially diverse place I've visited in months is a loud bastion of clanks and clangs which visit luck to few and tragedy to many. The breakfast foods lacked quality I am used to in foodie capital PDX. The bagels lacked tooth and the. Breakfast pastries. Looked Costco ish. I was sorry to miss the horse racin that might have been more fun than this wasteland.

My husband did the Rusty Wallace NASCAR driving experience. It is not cheap but it is very well run and the employees are fun friendly and knowledgeable. We had a beautiful day for it too. Don't go hungry because there is no food available once you're at the track. Don't pay extra for the Go Pro video... it's just audio of the track in front of you as you're driving. DO bring 50 extra bucks to buy the official picture they take of you and put in an official looking frame. All in all a fun experience.

I would give this hotel experience 2.5 as it was just ok for me. I stayed here for two nights and I must say I was soo glad to get home and sleep in my own bed!! I liked that the hotel offered plenty of parking, I ended up getting a spot very close to the hotel. When I checked in, the staff was nice but seemed very inexperienced about their job. The lady asked for my debit card to put a hold on the room and without me realizing she even charged me for my two nights upfront without my authorization! Then when I told her I wanted to pay in cash they told me I had to wait until the next morning  ( ughh) So the next morning I asked them to reverse the charges so I can pay in cash and they acted like they didn't want to do it! Overall I ended up having to call my bank and they immediately removed the charges from my account! Hahaha meanwhile the lady staring at me like a dear in headlights! (and I sighs)So after that fiasco was over I felt much better however I wasn't that impressed by my room, although it was spacious and offered great amenities, the bathroom to me could of used some remodeling. I don't know if it was me but my shower had two heads the handheld and the regular and for some reason the water only worked from the handheld that was in the corner of the shower ughh and the water came out so hard! and I can't forget that my hotel room carpet had stains on it! Now let's get into the casino, so the hotel offers a casino and I liked that the entire casino was smoke free and the machines and area was neat and clean!! However I  didn't like that the casino didn't really have a good variety of dining options, I just wasn't impressed by any of the restaurants they had to offer plus the food was on the pricey side.Overall I came for a two day conference which was paid for by my company so I can't get mad at that, however I would not come back to stay overnight at this hotel it's just not worth it to me!

I liked Dover Downs Hotel and Casino because it's a nice conference center without being huge-- it's not ultra plush or a luxury resort, but a nice hotel at a casino.  Comparing it to the local resort and convention center at National Harbor, it's a reasonable size as the Gaylord at Nation Harbor is ridiculously BIG.  You have to trek a mile to get the the check in counter.  Ask about the nearest bathroom, they'll tell you downstairs and across a football field.   Here at Dover Downs, it's spacious, but everything is in a decent proximity.The rooms are between really nice and standard.  The rooms are currently smoke free, but it's obvious from the smell embedded in the walls and carpet that it was formerly a hotel that allowed smoking.   The hotel is aging a bit, but it's still comfortable.  I had great sleep. Dover Downs is also located on a strip that has everything from Friday's to Ruby Tuesdays, Noodles and Company, Olive Garden, Coldstone Ice cream and more.  I didn't visit the shops at the hotel and casino, but there are plenty of stores around to suit your needs.  I'm not a casino person, but I will be back if I'm offered to go.

Dover Downs is a nice destination for a weekend getaway. I recently went up for the weekend from the Washington, DC area, and I was pleasantly surprised. There is so much to do right there on the grounds that you don't even need to venture out.The hotel is nice. Lots of rooms and clean.  I'm not a fan of hotels, but when I stayed here, I didn't feel apprehensive about it. However, the hotel is starting to show a little age so with all the money they collect, maybe an upgrade is in the works.On top of that, the casino itself is awesome. An entire floor of games that really do pay off! From slots to the tables, take your pick!  Then when you're ready to take a break, you can go to any of the complimentary drink stations or one of the many restaurants that are right off to the side of the casino floor. In conclusion, I had a lot of fun at Dover Downs and that's why I'm a fan.

Plenty of parking and lots of shopping and eating nearby (need to drive to).

Just alittle update that been meaning to write that everybody at Dover Downs has been very very Nice to me and I just want to thank all the nice girls that work the front desk they really do try to give there customers what they want! Only thing I want to complain bout is the new Check out time which is not there fault! Not really sure why they changed it I have been told 3 different stories! But in my opinion I think if you are E-lite card holder you should still get a noon check-out! Gold and Silver cards 11 check -out! That way that gives them something to work on to become a Black card member!! That hour makes big deal if you are up playing till 3:30 or 4:00 in morning!! I sure hope that the casino doesn't start changing things to much because I would hate to see them lose anymore customers due to the fact so many Casinos! I live 10 mins from MD.LIVE Casino but I choose to come to Dover to play and have Fun!! But I hear a lot of people gonna be going to MGM Casino opening on Dec.8th I sure hope that it doesn't affect Dover Casino! And people will still come to support a smaller town Casino! Because they do go out and above on a lot of Events they give to there card members! Just like this past weekend the Octoberfest they had!! Omg very very nice! Food was delish!

**This review is specifically for the hotel.**We stayed here for the NASCAR race and since it is on track property, it is very convenient. It is a fullservice hotel and casino with room service, a spa, fitness center, pool, restaurants, and shopping. They need a renovation badly. Our room was disgusting- there were visible stains all over the carpet, furniture and walls. Luckily I had flip flops so I wasn't walking around with my bare feet. The beds were highly uncomfortable. They only had doubles left so my boyfriend and I shared a bed one night and tried our own beds another night. They were so soft and creaked every time you rolled over. The shower was not a pleasant experience either. It's hot or cold and the shower head had the worst spray. Two stars for convenience: proximity to track and room service till 1am.Note that this track is in the middle of town and there are plenty of other hotels down the street as well.

We visit every time we are in Dover.  The casino is cool and fun.  They serve complimentary sodas.  There are a few restaurants in the casino.  Security has a strong presence and they are quite nice.

We had our wedding here and it was an awesome time. This is the nicest venue in Dover for a big wedding because the resort has everything for a diverse crowd. Our guests enjoyed the five star restaurant Michelle's and also all the other restaurants. They went to the spa. But most importantly, they loved that they could gamble. At weddings there is often a lot of downtime so that gave them something to do.We needed a large space because we had a traditional Indian wedding and the ballroom fit the bill. We also had the rehearsal dinner in the Kent Room and that was wonderful (the Kent room can have up to 50 people.) The event coordinator was excellent. She was extremely patient in listening to us and accommodating all our needs. She was so good, in fact, that we didn't need to hire a wedding planner. This is a great place to bring out of town guests or to stop by on your way down to the beach. Dover Downs is not just a place for Nascar. It's a fun place to gather with friends and family.

I stayed overnight at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino on March 24th for a food show. Since I booked my reservation at the last minute I almost didn't get a room, but the woman in reservations helped me get a room (and I got the group rate for being part of the food show!).This is a great hotel for business purposes. My hotel room was huge and included the most comfortable bedding, free WIFI, flat screen t.v., desk, and a huge spa-like bathroom with luxurious toiletries. The room was very soundproof and I slept like a baby that night. The following morning I was able to make my way downstairs for breakfast and I ordered a coffee, breakfast sandwich, and a fruit cup for under $10 at Sweet Perks Cafe. (Since I did not have a car I was very grateful to have this cafe onsite so that I did not have to eat from a mediocre buffet or pay $25+ for room service.) My only complaint was that although the bath towels in my room felt heavenly they left lint EVERYWHERE. I had lint on my skin, in my hair, all over my clothes... it was a complete mess! Other than the towels my stay at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino was terrific!

WHOA!!!!!! PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU CONSIDER!!!!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!For a quick summation: AWFUL- just make the trip to Atlantic City!!!!!If you are looking for a Hotel / Casino experience this is NOT THE PLACE AT ALL......It is EXTREMELY MISLEADING if you go by the website which makes it look beautiful! We booked through Travelocity which listed terrific amenities and photos made it look like (and referred to it as) a LUXURY hotel. In reality, it is on the side of the road with our view from our "upgraded" 10th floor room being that of the shopping center across the street and parking lot.SIMPLY PUT: Health concerns prevented us from enjoying BASICS that EVERY decent hotel has!!!!!!!!!!! The website and everything else promoting this "hotel and casino" as luxurious on website (jacuzzi and pool......both of which were incredibly FILTHY......not just dirty but YEARS of neglect were clear from the pictures you can see the LITERAL RING AROUND THE TUB!!!!!! The "jacuzzi" was the size of a regular bathtub so it would be an extremely intimate experience if you DARED to go in but honestly, it was all FOAMY from people using it as their personal cleansing bathtub and/or no cleaning/maintenance. My sister and I LITERALLY would not even put our FEET in it to see how it felt !!!!We wanted to swim but the pool was only 3 feet (no big deal there) but it was SMALL - the size a jacuzzi should be, lol..........and it was DIIIIIIIIIIIRTY- again - years of neglect: MOLDY!!!!!I honestly do not know how they stay open due to the HEALTH VIOLATIONS!!!!!!The buffet made BOTH my sister and I SICK so that HAD to be from the awful food (animals were fighting over crab legs that were dry tasting and since no crackers were given you had to use your hands like a caveman !!!!!) The gym that smelled of cat spray (of all things, oddly enough???) prevented us from our daily workout.  REPULSIVE!Again, if we KNEW the hotel was so horrendous I would have booked us at the Hilton across the street where we are members of HiltonHonors and even so.......thinking about it, the poorly lit dangerous parking lot and clientele would not even make it worth it.We will NEVER return; in fact we are embroiled in a battle to get a refund or at least reduction due to the fact that we were not able to use the jacuzzi, pool or gym (FILTH!!!). We were absolutely horrified upon pulling up and seeing that this was an outdated, filthy building among TJ Maxx, Target, Super Cuts, etc. and MOST IMPORTANTLY- do NOT risk your health and safety. That's the bottom line. If we lived closer I don't think I'd even go!  It is really that bad.I will say one nice thing: they have one good machine that my sis and I had a ball with and we had a good laugh about the fact that it was SOOOOOOOOO bad..... we just had to laugh! It was sooo outrageous when we were comparing the website pix to the reality. It is so dirty and the best part (SARCASM dripping off that word "best") was that upon checkout, the "supervisor" of the desk (whatever that means) was NASTY when we simply asked for our folio (bill broken down).  She simply took out a calculator and showed us 209 (advertised price) plus taxes plus $50 incidentals fee.  She said "you ain't got no incidentals so that will fall off" ........ well we shall see if that happens. I doubt it.My sister is writing to the DE department of health and to the board or CFO- trying that hard because it was THAT bad........ I can't believe this joint is still operating !!!!!! It is struggling apparently (all found out after our last minute choice to stay there after seeing it was on our way home and it looked awesome on website, lol) ...... talk about CATFISH!!!!!!!!!!!This was like having a dating profile with a Taylor Swift picture and you meet a smelly man instead.I HAVE PICTURES OF FILTHY AREAS- I CAN'T POST THEM????? WHY?????? I do not know how to post pics :( I will find out then add them.......promise. I don't want anyone else getting sick and ripped off, adding insult to injury!

I have just returned from a weekend at Dover Downs.  I stayed there a few years ago, and had no complaints.  This time as a guest, I felt like I was staying at a moderate level hotel.  We had two rooms, both were not clean.  Carpets were not swept, crumbs in the sheets, water marks in the toilet bowls, etc.  We were comped for dinner buffet for our inconvenience.  The buffet was very good and we were both happy.  Within 12 hours we were both sick.  We both ate the crab and shrimp.  We ate at the Garden Cafe for breakfast.  My friend was happy with her meal. I personally was disappointed to be served frozen pre-seasoned home fries, overly salty Canadian bacon for over 10 a plate.  My friend had the pancakes and they looked very good.It used to be a nice place to go.  Now it is not.

What a beautiful place to hold an event. I went here for a Scottish Rite event and the food and staff were excellent. I would definitely recommend to others for holding large group parties or events. It also helps that the drinks at the casino bar are reasonably priced and strong.
