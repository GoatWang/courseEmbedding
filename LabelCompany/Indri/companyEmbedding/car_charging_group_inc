					Full Description



Car Charging Group, Inc., incorporated on October 3, 2006, is an owner, operator and provider of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. The Company offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to recharge at various location types. The Company's principal line of products and services is its Blink EV charging network (the Blink Network) and EV charging equipment (also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)) and EV related services. Its Blink Network is a cloud-based software that operates, maintains and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers and parking companies (referred to as Property Partners) with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations, payment processing, and provides EV drivers with station information, including station location, availability and applicable fees.The Company offers its property partners with a range of business models for EV charging equipment and services. In its business model, the Company owns and operates the EV charging equipment, manages the installation, maintenance and related services. For Property Partners interested in purchasing and owning EV charging stations, that they manage, it can also provide EV charging hardware, site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, and service and maintenance services. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 4,880 Level 2 public charging units, 130 direct current (DC) Fast Charging EV chargers and 2,800 residential charging units in service on the Blink Network. Additionally, it had approximately 370 Level 2 charging units on other networks and there are also approximately an additional 3,400 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations, at December 31, 2015. The Company offers a range of EV charging products and services to property partners and EV drivers.EV Charging ProductsThe Company offers Level 2 (AC) EV charging equipment, which is ideal for commercial and residential use, and has the standard J1772 connector, which is compatible with all auto manufacturer electric vehicle models. The Company's commercial equipment is available in pedestal or wall mount configurations, with the ability to connect to its Blink Network. Its non-networked residential product, Blink HQ, is available in a wall-mount configuration and offers a delay start feature that allows users to adjust charging by utility rates. Level 2 charging stations typically provide a full charge in 2 to 8 hours. Level 2 chargers are suited for installations and frequently used parking locations, such as workplace, multifamily residential, retail and mixed-use, parking garages, municipalities, colleges/schools, hospitals and airports. Its DC Fast charging equipment (DFC) has the CHAdeMo connector, which is compatible with Nissan, Kia and Tesla electric vehicle models, and typically provides a full charge in approximately 30 minutes. Installation of DC Fast Charging stations and grid requirements are typically greater than Level 2 charging stations, and are suited for transportation hubs and locations between travel destinations.EV Charging ServicesThe Company's Blink Network allows it to share station management features and pertinent data with property partners and EV drivers through user interfaces. These features include real-time station status, payment processing, detailed charging session information, monitoring and troubleshooting stations remotely, as well as customized reporting capabilities (energy dispensed, greenhouse gases reduced, oil barrels saved and gallons of fuel saved, among others). Its mobile application, available for iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android, provides EV drivers with station information, including the ability to locate EV charging stations on the Blink Network, view real-time station status information, pay and initiate EV charging sessions, become a Blink member, and manage their Blink account (billing information, radio-frequency identification (RFID) cards, short message service (SMS) and e-mail notifications).The Company competes with ChargePoint, EVgo, General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect and Greenlots.
