Developing Targeted and Immuno-Oncology Agents 
 
	
                                        	BeiGene is a globally focused biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival.

Cancer Biology Platform 
 


Our cancer biology platform addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary tumor biopsies in developing new cancer models. Our proximity to leading cancer centers in Beijing and close relationships with clinicians have allowed us to develop an extensive collection of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models, enabling our research team to better select targets, screen and evaluate therapeutic agents we believe have significant potential alone or in combination to be best- or first-in-class treatments for a variety of cancers.

 
 






Global Focus, Global Impact 
 


We have a global team of 300+ individuals, including around 200 scientists and clinicians, with deep scientific talent, extensive pharmaceutical experience, and a commitment to improving the lives of cancer patients around the world.

BeiGene, Ltd. Key Developments

Beigene, Ltd. Announces Strategic Collaboration with Celgene Corporation
Jul 6 17
On July 5, 2017, BeiGene, Ltd. entered into an Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement with Celgene and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Celgene Switzerland LLC pursuant to which the Company has agreed to grant the Celgene parties an exclusive right to develop and commercialize BGB-A317 in all fields of treatment, other than hematology, in the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of world other than Asia. Pursuant to the terms of the PD-1 License Agreement, the Celgene parties will make upfront payments to the Company of $263 million. The Company may also receive up to $980 million in potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments and tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales, depending on specified terms, in the low double digit to mid-twenties, with customary reductions in specified circumstances. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of the last valid patent claim, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or 12 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in the country of sale. Each party has the right to develop and commercialize BGB-A317 in their respective fields and territories, and have also agreed to collaborate through a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party on, among other things, the conduct of up to eight global registrational clinical trials (“Basket Studies”). Each Basket Study will be conducted and funded by either the Company or Celgene in accordance with a mutually agreed development plan and study design. For any Basket Studies conducted and funded by the Company, Celgene has the right to opt into such program, at which time it will reimburse the Company for agreed upon development costs based on a multiple of such costs that varies according to the stage of development at which Celgene opts into the program. Celgene has committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one licensed product and to seek specified regulatory approvals, and to spend at least $100 million on development for the Basket Studies led by Celgene, subject to specified conditions. In addition, BeiGene retains the right to develop BGB-A317 in combination therapies with its portfolio compounds, and Celgene has a right of first negotiation for BGB-A317 in the hematology field and in BeiGene’s territory, subject to specified conditions. The PD-1 License Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company and Celgene. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term in such country for such licensed product. The agreement may be terminated by Celgene upon 30 days’ prior written notice, or by either party upon the other party’s bankruptcy or uncured material breach.


Celgene Corporation Enters Into Global Strategic Immuno-Oncology Collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. to Advance PD-1 Inhibitor Program for Solid Tumor Cancers
Jul 6 17
Celgene Corporation and BeiGene, Ltd. entered into a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize BeiGene’s investigational anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, BGB-A317, for patients with solid tumor cancers in the United States, Europe, Japan and rest of world outside Asia. BeiGene will retain exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of BGB-A317 for hematological malignancies globally and for solid tumors in Asia (with the exception of Japan). BeiGene will acquire Celgene’s commercial operations in China and gain an exclusive license to commercialize Celgene’s approved therapies in China – ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID® and VIDAZA®. BGB-A317 is an advanced clinical-stage investigational PD-1 inhibitor, which has been dosed in over 500 patients. Initial clinical data suggest that BGB-A317 is well tolerated and exhibits anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumor types. BGB-A317 has high affinity and specificity for PD-1 and may be differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies through an engineered Fc region, potentially minimizing interactions with other immune cells that may exert a negative impact on effector T-cell function. BGB-A317 is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. It is currently in two pivotal trials in China, and global pivotal studies of BGB-A317 are planned for initiation in 2018. Celgene and BeiGene will collaborate in the global development of BGB-A317. In addition, BeiGene retains the right to develop BGB-A317 in hematology and in combination with its other portfolio compounds. BeiGene will acquire Celgene’s operations in China. BeiGene will also license and assume commercial responsibility for Celgene’s approved therapies in China, consisting of ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound), REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) and VIDAZA® (azacitidine). In addition, BeiGene is granted licensing rights in China to CC-122, under the same terms and conditions as the approved commercial products. CC-122 is a CelMOD currently in development by Celgene for lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. BeiGene plans to expand manufacturing and commercial operations in China in preparation for the potential approvals of BGB-A317 and future innovative therapies developed by BeiGene in greater China.


BeiGene, Ltd. Initiates Pivotal Trial of PD-1 Antibody BGB-A317 in China in Patients with Urothelial Cancer
Jul 5 17
BeiGene, Ltd. announced that the first patient was dosed in a pivotal clinical trial in China of BGB-A317, an investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with urothelial cancer (UC), more commonly known as bladder cancer. The trial will evaluate BGB-A317 in Chinese patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, locally advanced or metastatic UC. BGB-A317 is also being evaluated in a pivotal trial in China in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The Phase II single-arm, multi-center trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of BGB-A317 in patients with previously treated, PD-L1-positive, locally advanced or metastatic UC. The trial’s primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST V1.1), as assessed by independent review. Secondary endpoints include ORR as assessed by investigators, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and tolerability. Professor Dingwei Ye of the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center is the lead principal investigator of the trial. BGB-A317 is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of immuno-oncology agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is designed to bind to PD-1, a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in downregulating the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells. BGB-A317 has high affinity and specificity for PD-1, and we believe it is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies, as the ability to bind to Fc gamma receptors has been specifically engineered out. BGB-A317 is being developed as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of various cancers.
