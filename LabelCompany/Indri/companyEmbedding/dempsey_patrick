Celebrity Hairstyles for 2017
Celebrity hairstyles are great to look at when planning your next hairstyle. It helps that celebrities are everywhere, but the latest celebrity hairstyles are a useful source of inspiration because celebrities are usually on the cutting-edge of what's new and trendy- it's their job (after all) to make sure that their limelight doesn't fade away.

Medical MalpracticeMedical malpractice occurs when a doctor acts negligently and someone is seriously injured as a result. It may be because a doctor or other health care provider prescribed the wrong treatment, the wrong medication, or the wrong dose.


Wrongful DeathWrongful death claims is the general term for cases that involve the death of a person. Wrongful death claims are claims brought by either representatives of the estate of a person who was killed as the result of the acts of another or by family members of the deceased person.


Drunk DriversIn the United States the number of drunk driving accidents and deaths has sky-rocketed in recent years. The lives of innocent men, women, and children are being cut short by the reckless and illegal behavior of drunk drivers.


Personal InjuryA personal injury can be devastating to every aspect of the person's life. There may be mounting medical bills, lost wages due to inability to work, and always the intangible aspect of pain.


Product LiabilityYou have a right to expect that products you buy will not hurt you or make you ill. Defects can make ordinary products dangerous. Lack of proper warnings can make otherwise safe products hazardous.













Big Enough to Help, Small Enough to CareCall Us: (716) 885-8645 
If you have been injured as a result of someone's negligent act, we would appreciate the opportunity to help you find a fair and just resolution to your claim.
We recognize that each case begins with a personal story which is often tragic. We take the time to listen and build a relationship with our clients and we are passionate about obtaining fair results.

Drawing inspiration from the hair style
      trends of our favorite stars and celebrities has become a national past
      time. One such star whose hair style is a must have look is 
      Hollywood
      dream boat Patrick Dempsey.
 His �dream boat� hair style and unshaven look is irresistible to
      women attached to the rugged out doors type.


TO
      GET THE LOOK:  Do you sometimes feel like you�re the invisible dude at the party? If
      that�s the case, Patrick�s hair style can definitely turn the spot
      light on you. But be careful what you wish for, this head turning do� is
      loaded with sex appeal and a major �babe magnet� style. To
      get the look, let�s take it one step at a time, starting with style cut
      and shaping.


LET�S SHAPE IT: 
      For Patrick�s style, start with a full tousled silhouette with
      tapered neckline stylishly over the collar and mid length sideburns. This
      style is best suited for wavy hair and slender face shape with large
      facial features like Patrick�s. With a few adjustments (tweaks) as it
      grows you can easily find the ideal length and shape for your style.


LET�S
      STYLE IT:
To style, start with a dab of shaping
      gel or mousse or nothing at all. Just run either through damp hair and
      comb in place to dry au natural or give it a good tousle with a blow dryer
      for a full look. To turn up the sexy appeal and define the
      shape, when dry, add a dab of foaming
      pomade through the top and sides and you�ve got Patrick�s star
      style.


LET�S
      ADD SIDEBURNS & WHISKERS:
      Nothing can reshape a face or add a dramatic look like facial hair.
      Sideburns can make large ears appear smaller and make a narrow face wider.
      Whiskers will make a narrow chin appear wider, hide a double chin, cover a
      ruddy complexion and defiantly add a stylish or artsy look. Include close
      mid length sideburns with a five o�clock shadow for a rugged look and
      turn the style bar up a notch.


NOW,
      LET�S COLOR IT:  Entertainers
      and actors change their hair color often for the many roles they play so
      dying their hair is no big deal. If your hair color has lost it deep rich
      hue and graying around the edge; a dark brown tint or a shade closest to
      your natural hair color will wash the gray away and define the shape.
      After, a clear glaze seals in the color and turn on the shine. To keep it
      up, the new growth is colored every 6 weeks. This extra step will cost a
      few bucks but what the hell, its a small price to pay for a youthful look.


This head turning do� is the type of hair style
      that girls love to run their fingers through. The contoured shape with
      sideburns, close clipped whiskers and neckline stylishly over the collar
      is loaded with sex appeal. It rich warm color has washed the gray away and
      turned on the �babe magnet� effect. So the next time you show
      up at a party be prepared for the ladies to make a fuss over you and your
      new Patrick Dempsey �dream boat� style.

       
For Patrick's star
      style visit a salon
      stylist and make your 
      hair shine like the stars.

How To Get Hair Like Patrick Dempsey

	The obvious answer to the question, “How to get hair like Patrick Dempsey?”, would be: "Attain genetics similar to those prevalent in the charismatic actor’s family." Otherwise, you might choose to explore other options. And there are a number to choose from.


One option that should be considered when trying to get hair like Patrick Dempsey would involve a covert plan involving: breaking and entering, chloroform, a straight razor, and a gruesome procedure that might allow one to actually steal Patrick Dempsey’s locks and scalp from the forehead up and then wear it at your later convenience. However, since most don’t have the stomach nor resources for this, other courses of action should more than likely be considered.

One path you might consider in capturing a coif such as Patrick Dempsey’s would be to employ an $800-an-hour stylist. (But for most this would require a lucrative television contract with a network such as ABC and/or an illustrious film career not unlike that of this actor in question.)

An exploration of hair products promising similar results to those constantly achieved by Patrick Dempsey star would be a wise first move that could be undertaken initially through research of sources such as the internet, magazines, or conversations with a local hairstylis, the latter being the wisest move in that it would prove to be the most time-efficient. Even the most consumer-friendly of barbershops, hair salons and other such establishments have numerous volumes displaying photos of most every cut imaginable. And if you can also provide such establishments with actual representations of Dempsey’s current wear, the professionals on hand can usually accommodate you (or at least come as close as possible to delivering what you desire).


Tips For Getting Hair Like Patrick Dempsey:


Be aware of limitations. If you don’t want to employ a toupee or hair transplant, it’s obvious that your physical attributes (baldness, etc.) might signal defeat in your quest to get hair like Patrick Dempsey.

Make a to-do list. List what you need, such as hair care products, a specific stylist, etc. before diving in. (This will prove to be quite the time saver.)

Make your wants clearly known. Be sure to describe exactly what you want to your stylist, barber, etc. And don’t be afraid to supply photos depicting that Patrick Dempsey look you’re seeking.    


	Bear in mind that even the most proficient of stylist can only do so much with what nature has given you. So don’t expect miracles, unless you plan on being disappointed.

Gallery: 7 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Wonder Woman Gal Gadot









Wonder Woman has critics talking all sorts of good stuff (93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, anyone?), but one thing that really stands out is star Gal Gadot. Not only is she super talented, but she’s also super hot, and she has quite an interesting background, too. Read some fun facts and see some sexy pics on the following pages.







1. She’s a former Miss Israel: The Israeli model competed in and won the Miss Israel title in 2004, when she was 18 years old. Anyone with eyes can easily see why she took home the crown!







2. She wasn’t feeling the Miss Universe pageant at all: When she represented Israel at the competition in Ecuador, Gadot didn’t really try to win because she decided the pageant life wasn’t for her. “I’m just not that type of girl,” she told Jimmy Kimmel in 2016.







3. Like the role she plays in the movie, she’s pretty badass in real life, too: Gadot served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces. "Part of being Israeli is to go to the army,” she told People magazine. “All my friends went, my parents went and my grandparents went.” In related news, she caused a bit of a stir when she posed for Maxim magazine’s “Women of Israel Defense Forces” photo feature in 2007.







4. She’s smart AF: Gadot actually studied law and international relations in college. When a casting director approached her for a role, she thought she was “too serious and smart to be an actress," she told W magazine.







5. She’s not afraid of a little action: Gadot did her own stunts for the Fast & Furious movies. “The adrenaline was just incredible and I enjoyed being able to do the stuff that in real life you can’t,” she told Real Style Network in 2013. In a separate interview, she said she wanted to be a “tough girl.” “I want to have gunshots, I want to fly up in the air, on the motorcycle, whatever. I want to do it all, by myself—no stuntwoman.” Certainly none was required for the stunt she pulls in the Fast Five clip above.







6. She’s a taken lady: Gadot met her husband, real estate developer Yaron Varsano, in the desert. As she told Glamour, the couple was introduced through mutual friends at a “very strange” desert party in Israel. “It was all about yoga, chakras, and eating healthy — we didn’t exactly find ourselves there, but we found each other.” The couple have been married for nearly nine years and have two daughters.







7. She’s loaded: In 2015, the couple sold their luxury hotel, the Varsano, for a reported $26 million. The buyer? Russian billionaire and Leonardo DiCaprio’s yacht king BFF Roman Abramovich, who, according to the Daily Mail, purchased the Tel Aviv property to convert into his own Israeli home. Hot, smart and rich? Diana Prince herself would be proud.

Patrick Galen Dempsey[2] (born January 13, 1966)[3] is an American actor and race car driver, best known for his role as neurosurgeon Derek "McDreamy" Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy. He saw early success as an actor, starring in a number of films in his early 20s, including Can't Buy Me Love (1987) and Loverboy (1989). In the 1990s, he mostly appeared in smaller roles in film, such as Outbreak (1995), and television, before landing a lead role in Sweet Home Alabama (2002), a surprise box office hit. He has since then starred in a number of other films, including Enchanted (2007), Made of Honor (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), Flypaper (2011), Freedom Writers (2007), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) and Bridget Jones's Baby (2016).
Dempsey, who maintains a sports car and vintage car collection, also enjoys auto racing in his spare time. He has competed in pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Ensenada SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would "walk away" from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports.[4]

Early life[edit]
Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine,[3] and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters.[5] His mother, Amanda (née Casson),[6][7] was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman.[3][8][9]
He attended Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School.[5]
In his youth, Patrick Dempsey participated in juggling competitions. In 1981 he achieved the second place at the International Jugglers' Association Championship in the Juniors category, just behind Anthony Gatto, who is considered to be the best technical juggler of all time.[10]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age twelve. He told Barbara Walters on her 2008 Oscar special that he thinks dyslexia made him what he is today. "It's given me a perspective of—you have to keep working," Dempsey told Walters. "I have never given up."[11]
Acting career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Dempsey was discovered by an invitation to audition for a role in the stage production of Torch Song Trilogy. His audition was successful, and he spent the following four months touring with the company in Philadelphia. He followed this with another tour, Brighton Beach Memoirs, in the lead role, which was directed by Gene Saks. Dempsey has also made notable appearances in the stage productions of On Golden Pond, with the Maine Acting Company, and as Timmy (the Martin Sheen role) in a 1990 Off-Broadway revival of The Subject Was Roses co-starring with John Mahoney and Dana Ivey at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.
Dempsey's first major feature film role was at age 21 with Beverly D'Angelo in the movie In The Mood, the true World War II story about Ellsworth Wisecarver whose relationships with older married women created a national uproar. He then co-starred in the third installment of the comedy classic Meatballs III: Summer Job, alongside Sally Kellerman in 1987. This was followed by the teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love in 1987 with actress Amanda Peterson and Some Girls with Jennifer Connelly in 1988. In 1989, Dempsey had the lead role in the films Loverboy with actress Kirstie Alley and Happy Together with actress Helen Slater.[12]
1990s and 2000s[edit]
Dempsey made a number of featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. However, he received good reviews[13] as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman's closeted sportscaster boyfriend on Will & Grace. He went on to play the role of Aaron Brooks on Once & Again. Dempsey received an Emmy[14] nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series JFK: Reckless Youth. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in Scream 3.[12]
Dempsey had a high-profile role as the fiancé of Reese Witherspoon's character in Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production Iron Jawed Angels, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in The Practice for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15).

In 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film Enchanted, and the Paramount Pictures film Freedom Writers where he reunited with his Iron Jawed Angels co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in Brother Bear 2, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Dempsey's most recent roles include the 2008 film Made of Honor as Tom and the 2010s romantic comedy Valentine's Day; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love.[15]
Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel The Art of Racing in the Rain in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in.[16] The project has not been able to find a director.[17] He starred as Dylan Gould in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[18][19]
In 2013, Dempsey starred in the romantic comedy Wonderful Tonight opposite Amanda Seyfried.[20]
Grey's Anatomy[edit]
Main article: Grey's Anatomy
Dempsey has received significant public attention for his role as Dr. Derek Shepherd (McDreamy) in the drama Grey's Anatomy. Prior to landing the role, Dempsey auditioned for the role of Dr. Chase on another medical show, House. He also appeared in two episodes of the Grey's spinoff Private Practice, playing the same character.[12] In January 2014, He signed a two-year contract to remain on Grey's Anatomy, then in its tenth season, that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons.[21][22][23]
Dempsey was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series–Drama at the 2006 Golden Globes for the role. His success on the show has led to his becoming a spokesman for Mazda and State Farm Insurance.[24][25] BuddyTV ranked him #1 on its list of "TV's Sexiest Men of 2011".[26]
Following his departure from Grey's Anatomy, Dempsey was working on two small-screen projects: a drama The Limit for SundanceTV and a travelogue spy thriller called Fodors. He also said: "I would love to do something else. I’m going to take the rest of the year off to develop. I would like to be a producer. I would commit to a show that is 10 to 12 episodes. But 24 again, I don’t know if I would do that. It's a very hard life. It's financially rewarding but there comes a point where how much is enough, really? I’m focusing now on developing and racing and being a father to my children."[27]
Promotional work[edit]
He has been the face of L'Oreal and Versace and was featured in ads for Serengeti sunglasses. In November 2008, he launched an Avon fragrance named Unscripted, and due to its success, a second fragrance named Patrick Dempsey 2 was launched in October 2009.[needs update] On September 29, 2012, Mexican cable company Cablemás, Megacable and Mexico city's Cablevisión launched an advertising campaign featuring Patrick Dempsey as the love interest of a domestic worker who comes across his profile on an online dating site.[28] Starting in 2013, Patrick Dempsey is the face of Silhouette, promoting eyewear fashion from Austria.[29] From January 2017 Dempsey is testimonial of Vodafone Italy and he appear in some Italian spot about it.[30]
Auto racing[edit]

In 2014, Dempsey told Reuters in the Hockenheimring support paddock at the German Grand Prix that motor racing was not just a hobby, and had become as much a part of who he is as acting. He said, "It's all-consuming in many ways. I couldn't imagine not racing right now. It really keeps me motivated. It's all I think about on a daily basis."[31]
Dempsey, who maintains an extensive sports and vintage car collection, has enjoyed auto racing in his spare time for several years, and declared before the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2013 that he would like to compete full-time, telling Eurosport:

I would like to make that [motorsports] a complete priority and just focus on this full-time. If I could just walk away from acting, I think I could do that very easily, and just focus on the driving, I would love that more than anything else.

He has competed in prestigious pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. He was a co-owner of the Vision Racing IndyCar Series team and current owner of Dempsey Racing, which is presently racing two Porsche 911 GT America's in the Tudor United Sports Car Series. He participated in this series as often as his schedule allowed, although insurance restrictions kept him from driving competitively while also filming a motion picture. In 2009, he raced a Team Seattle Advanced Engineering Ferrari F430 GT in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans's GT2 class and finished ninth in class.[32]
Dempsey announced he would race the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona along with other races throughout the season in a Mazda RX-8.[33]
Dempsey finished in third place in the GT Class of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. In 2012, Dempsey competed in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Racing-Multimatic Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which, after five successful racing seasons in Europe, was to make its debut on American tracks. He formed the Dempsey Racing team to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The team fielded a full-time Oreca FLM09 in the Prototype Challenge class as well as a Lola B12/80 coupe in the Prototype 2 class from Laguna Seca onward.[citation needed]
After debuting at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey returned to France four years later and competed in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Dempsey and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and fourth in-class.[citation needed]
Telling Porsche Newsroom: "Not much changes in my TV work, but everything changes constantly in motor racing – every lap, every bend and every moment."[34]
In 2015, Dempsey is focusing on participating in the FIA World Endurance Championship with his own Dempsey Racing-Proton team in the GTE-Am class in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR, teamed with Patrick Long and Marco Seefried.

Tully's Coffee[edit]
In January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully's Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.[35]
Following a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas owner Michael Avenatti, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan "exorbitant" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Avenatti's office issued a second statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company "all the best". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a "misunderstanding" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.[36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. As a result, it is necessary for him to memorize all his lines in order to perform, even for auditions where he was unlikely to get the part.[38][39]
Entertainment Weekly put Dempsey's hair on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "What made Grey's Anatomy a mega-medi-hit? It could have something to do with creator Shonda Rhimes' scalpel-sharp writing…or McDreamy's impossibly luxurious man hair. Just saying."[40] In 2005, People magazine ranked him second in its annual list of "Sexiest Men Alive"[41] and again in 2006.[42]
Dempsey has been married twice. In 1987,[3] he married his manager,[43] actress and acting coach, Rochelle "Rocky" Parker, when he was 21 and she 48.[2] She appeared with Dempsey in the film In the Mood. While it has been reported that Dempsey married his best friend's mother, he has been quoted saying that he became best friends with Parker's son only after he became romantically involved with Parker. The couple divorced in 1994. She died in 2014.[44]
On July 31, 1999, Dempsey married hairstylist and makeup artist Jillian Fink.[43] The couple have three children, daughter Talula Fyfe[43][44][45] (born February 20, 2002), and twin sons Sullivan Patrick and Darby Galen (born February 1, 2007).[5][44] In January 2015, Fink filed for divorce,[46] but the couple reconciled later in the year.[47] They called off their divorce on November 12, 2016.[48]
Dempsey supports Rangers F.C.[49]
Cancer-research philanthropy[edit]
In 1997, Dempsey's mother, Amanda, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which subsequently relapsed five times. On March 24, 2014, she died in Lewiston, Maine, aged 79.[50] In response to his mother's bouts with cancer, Dempsey helped start the Patrick Dempsey Center at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. In October 2009, when Dempsey introduced the first Dempsey Challenge, registration was closed after reaching the goal of 3,500 cyclists, runners and walkers. The event raised more than $1 million for the cancer center. His mother was in the crowd as Dempsey finished his 50-mile ride.[51] The Challenge has since become an annual October event presented by Amgen in the Lewiston–Auburn area.[52] On May 28, 2017, Dempsey received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in his hometown, Lewiston, Maine for his philanthropy in the town and funding of "the Dempsey Center — just blocks from the Bates campus."[53]
Dempsey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin College in 2013 for his philanthropic work.[54] His Grey's Anatomy character Derek Shepherd had been written as a Bowdoin graduate after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to "adopt" the character as an alumnus.[55]

Patrick Galen Dempsey[2] (born January 13, 1966)[3] is an American actor and race car driver, best known for his role as neurosurgeon Derek "McDreamy" Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy. He saw early success as an actor, starring in a number of films in his early 20s, including Can't Buy Me Love (1987) and Loverboy (1989). In the 1990s, he mostly appeared in smaller roles in film, such as Outbreak (1995), and television, before landing a lead role in Sweet Home Alabama (2002), a surprise box office hit. He has since then starred in a number of other films, including Enchanted (2007), Made of Honor (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), Flypaper (2011), Freedom Writers (2007), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) and Bridget Jones's Baby (2016).
Dempsey, who maintains a sports car and vintage car collection, also enjoys auto racing in his spare time. He has competed in pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Ensenada SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would "walk away" from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports.[4]

Early life[edit]
Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine,[3] and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters.[5] His mother, Amanda (née Casson),[6][7] was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman.[3][8][9]
He attended Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School.[5]
In his youth, Patrick Dempsey participated in juggling competitions. In 1981 he achieved the second place at the International Jugglers' Association Championship in the Juniors category, just behind Anthony Gatto, who is considered to be the best technical juggler of all time.[10]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age twelve. He told Barbara Walters on her 2008 Oscar special that he thinks dyslexia made him what he is today. "It's given me a perspective of—you have to keep working," Dempsey told Walters. "I have never given up."[11]
Acting career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Dempsey was discovered by an invitation to audition for a role in the stage production of Torch Song Trilogy. His audition was successful, and he spent the following four months touring with the company in Philadelphia. He followed this with another tour, Brighton Beach Memoirs, in the lead role, which was directed by Gene Saks. Dempsey has also made notable appearances in the stage productions of On Golden Pond, with the Maine Acting Company, and as Timmy (the Martin Sheen role) in a 1990 Off-Broadway revival of The Subject Was Roses co-starring with John Mahoney and Dana Ivey at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.
Dempsey's first major feature film role was at age 21 with Beverly D'Angelo in the movie In The Mood, the true World War II story about Ellsworth Wisecarver whose relationships with older married women created a national uproar. He then co-starred in the third installment of the comedy classic Meatballs III: Summer Job, alongside Sally Kellerman in 1987. This was followed by the teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love in 1987 with actress Amanda Peterson and Some Girls with Jennifer Connelly in 1988. In 1989, Dempsey had the lead role in the films Loverboy with actress Kirstie Alley and Happy Together with actress Helen Slater.[12]
1990s and 2000s[edit]
Dempsey made a number of featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. However, he received good reviews[13] as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman's closeted sportscaster boyfriend on Will & Grace. He went on to play the role of Aaron Brooks on Once & Again. Dempsey received an Emmy[14] nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series JFK: Reckless Youth. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in Scream 3.[12]
Dempsey had a high-profile role as the fiancé of Reese Witherspoon's character in Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production Iron Jawed Angels, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in The Practice for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15).

In 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film Enchanted, and the Paramount Pictures film Freedom Writers where he reunited with his Iron Jawed Angels co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in Brother Bear 2, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Dempsey's most recent roles include the 2008 film Made of Honor as Tom and the 2010s romantic comedy Valentine's Day; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love.[15]
Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel The Art of Racing in the Rain in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in.[16] The project has not been able to find a director.[17] He starred as Dylan Gould in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[18][19]
In 2013, Dempsey starred in the romantic comedy Wonderful Tonight opposite Amanda Seyfried.[20]
Grey's Anatomy[edit]
Main article: Grey's Anatomy
Dempsey has received significant public attention for his role as Dr. Derek Shepherd (McDreamy) in the drama Grey's Anatomy. Prior to landing the role, Dempsey auditioned for the role of Dr. Chase on another medical show, House. He also appeared in two episodes of the Grey's spinoff Private Practice, playing the same character.[12] In January 2014, He signed a two-year contract to remain on Grey's Anatomy, then in its tenth season, that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons.[21][22][23]
Dempsey was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series–Drama at the 2006 Golden Globes for the role. His success on the show has led to his becoming a spokesman for Mazda and State Farm Insurance.[24][25] BuddyTV ranked him #1 on its list of "TV's Sexiest Men of 2011".[26]
Following his departure from Grey's Anatomy, Dempsey was working on two small-screen projects: a drama The Limit for SundanceTV and a travelogue spy thriller called Fodors. He also said: "I would love to do something else. I’m going to take the rest of the year off to develop. I would like to be a producer. I would commit to a show that is 10 to 12 episodes. But 24 again, I don’t know if I would do that. It's a very hard life. It's financially rewarding but there comes a point where how much is enough, really? I’m focusing now on developing and racing and being a father to my children."[27]
Promotional work[edit]
He has been the face of L'Oreal and Versace and was featured in ads for Serengeti sunglasses. In November 2008, he launched an Avon fragrance named Unscripted, and due to its success, a second fragrance named Patrick Dempsey 2 was launched in October 2009.[needs update] On September 29, 2012, Mexican cable company Cablemás, Megacable and Mexico city's Cablevisión launched an advertising campaign featuring Patrick Dempsey as the love interest of a domestic worker who comes across his profile on an online dating site.[28] Starting in 2013, Patrick Dempsey is the face of Silhouette, promoting eyewear fashion from Austria.[29] From January 2017 Dempsey is testimonial of Vodafone Italy and he appear in some Italian spot about it.[30]
Auto racing[edit]

In 2014, Dempsey told Reuters in the Hockenheimring support paddock at the German Grand Prix that motor racing was not just a hobby, and had become as much a part of who he is as acting. He said, "It's all-consuming in many ways. I couldn't imagine not racing right now. It really keeps me motivated. It's all I think about on a daily basis."[31]
Dempsey, who maintains an extensive sports and vintage car collection, has enjoyed auto racing in his spare time for several years, and declared before the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2013 that he would like to compete full-time, telling Eurosport:

I would like to make that [motorsports] a complete priority and just focus on this full-time. If I could just walk away from acting, I think I could do that very easily, and just focus on the driving, I would love that more than anything else.

He has competed in prestigious pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. He was a co-owner of the Vision Racing IndyCar Series team and current owner of Dempsey Racing, which is presently racing two Porsche 911 GT America's in the Tudor United Sports Car Series. He participated in this series as often as his schedule allowed, although insurance restrictions kept him from driving competitively while also filming a motion picture. In 2009, he raced a Team Seattle Advanced Engineering Ferrari F430 GT in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans's GT2 class and finished ninth in class.[32]
Dempsey announced he would race the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona along with other races throughout the season in a Mazda RX-8.[33]
Dempsey finished in third place in the GT Class of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. In 2012, Dempsey competed in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Racing-Multimatic Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which, after five successful racing seasons in Europe, was to make its debut on American tracks. He formed the Dempsey Racing team to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The team fielded a full-time Oreca FLM09 in the Prototype Challenge class as well as a Lola B12/80 coupe in the Prototype 2 class from Laguna Seca onward.[citation needed]
After debuting at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey returned to France four years later and competed in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Dempsey and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and fourth in-class.[citation needed]
Telling Porsche Newsroom: "Not much changes in my TV work, but everything changes constantly in motor racing – every lap, every bend and every moment."[34]
In 2015, Dempsey is focusing on participating in the FIA World Endurance Championship with his own Dempsey Racing-Proton team in the GTE-Am class in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR, teamed with Patrick Long and Marco Seefried.

Tully's Coffee[edit]
In January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully's Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.[35]
Following a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas owner Michael Avenatti, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan "exorbitant" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Avenatti's office issued a second statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company "all the best". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a "misunderstanding" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.[36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. As a result, it is necessary for him to memorize all his lines in order to perform, even for auditions where he was unlikely to get the part.[38][39]
Entertainment Weekly put Dempsey's hair on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "What made Grey's Anatomy a mega-medi-hit? It could have something to do with creator Shonda Rhimes' scalpel-sharp writing…or McDreamy's impossibly luxurious man hair. Just saying."[40] In 2005, People magazine ranked him second in its annual list of "Sexiest Men Alive"[41] and again in 2006.[42]
Dempsey has been married twice. In 1987,[3] he married his manager,[43] actress and acting coach, Rochelle "Rocky" Parker, when he was 21 and she 48.[2] She appeared with Dempsey in the film In the Mood. While it has been reported that Dempsey married his best friend's mother, he has been quoted saying that he became best friends with Parker's son only after he became romantically involved with Parker. The couple divorced in 1994. She died in 2014.[44]
On July 31, 1999, Dempsey married hairstylist and makeup artist Jillian Fink.[43] The couple have three children, daughter Talula Fyfe[43][44][45] (born February 20, 2002), and twin sons Sullivan Patrick and Darby Galen (born February 1, 2007).[5][44] In January 2015, Fink filed for divorce,[46] but the couple reconciled later in the year.[47] They called off their divorce on November 12, 2016.[48]
Dempsey supports Rangers F.C.[49]
Cancer-research philanthropy[edit]
In 1997, Dempsey's mother, Amanda, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which subsequently relapsed five times. On March 24, 2014, she died in Lewiston, Maine, aged 79.[50] In response to his mother's bouts with cancer, Dempsey helped start the Patrick Dempsey Center at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. In October 2009, when Dempsey introduced the first Dempsey Challenge, registration was closed after reaching the goal of 3,500 cyclists, runners and walkers. The event raised more than $1 million for the cancer center. His mother was in the crowd as Dempsey finished his 50-mile ride.[51] The Challenge has since become an annual October event presented by Amgen in the Lewiston–Auburn area.[52] On May 28, 2017, Dempsey received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in his hometown, Lewiston, Maine for his philanthropy in the town and funding of "the Dempsey Center — just blocks from the Bates campus."[53]
Dempsey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin College in 2013 for his philanthropic work.[54] His Grey's Anatomy character Derek Shepherd had been written as a Bowdoin graduate after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to "adopt" the character as an alumnus.[55]

Patrick Galen Dempsey[2] (born January 13, 1966)[3] is an American actor and race car driver, best known for his role as neurosurgeon Derek "McDreamy" Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy. He saw early success as an actor, starring in a number of films in his early 20s, including Can't Buy Me Love (1987) and Loverboy (1989). In the 1990s, he mostly appeared in smaller roles in film, such as Outbreak (1995), and television, before landing a lead role in Sweet Home Alabama (2002), a surprise box office hit. He has since then starred in a number of other films, including Enchanted (2007), Made of Honor (2008), Valentine's Day (2010), Flypaper (2011), Freedom Writers (2007), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) and Bridget Jones's Baby (2016).
Dempsey, who maintains a sports car and vintage car collection, also enjoys auto racing in his spare time. He has competed in pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Ensenada SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would "walk away" from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports.[4]

Early life[edit]
Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine,[3] and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters.[5] His mother, Amanda (née Casson),[6][7] was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman.[3][8][9]
He attended Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School.[5]
In his youth, Patrick Dempsey participated in juggling competitions. In 1981 he achieved the second place at the International Jugglers' Association Championship in the Juniors category, just behind Anthony Gatto, who is considered to be the best technical juggler of all time.[10]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age twelve. He told Barbara Walters on her 2008 Oscar special that he thinks dyslexia made him what he is today. "It's given me a perspective of—you have to keep working," Dempsey told Walters. "I have never given up."[11]
Acting career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Dempsey was discovered by an invitation to audition for a role in the stage production of Torch Song Trilogy. His audition was successful, and he spent the following four months touring with the company in Philadelphia. He followed this with another tour, Brighton Beach Memoirs, in the lead role, which was directed by Gene Saks. Dempsey has also made notable appearances in the stage productions of On Golden Pond, with the Maine Acting Company, and as Timmy (the Martin Sheen role) in a 1990 Off-Broadway revival of The Subject Was Roses co-starring with John Mahoney and Dana Ivey at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.
Dempsey's first major feature film role was at age 21 with Beverly D'Angelo in the movie In The Mood, the true World War II story about Ellsworth Wisecarver whose relationships with older married women created a national uproar. He then co-starred in the third installment of the comedy classic Meatballs III: Summer Job, alongside Sally Kellerman in 1987. This was followed by the teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love in 1987 with actress Amanda Peterson and Some Girls with Jennifer Connelly in 1988. In 1989, Dempsey had the lead role in the films Loverboy with actress Kirstie Alley and Happy Together with actress Helen Slater.[12]
1990s and 2000s[edit]
Dempsey made a number of featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films The Player and About A Boy. However, he received good reviews[13] as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when Mobsters was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman's closeted sportscaster boyfriend on Will & Grace. He went on to play the role of Aaron Brooks on Once & Again. Dempsey received an Emmy[14] nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series JFK: Reckless Youth. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in Scream 3.[12]
Dempsey had a high-profile role as the fiancé of Reese Witherspoon's character in Sweet Home Alabama (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production Iron Jawed Angels, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in The Practice for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15).

In 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film Enchanted, and the Paramount Pictures film Freedom Writers where he reunited with his Iron Jawed Angels co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in Brother Bear 2, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Dempsey's most recent roles include the 2008 film Made of Honor as Tom and the 2010s romantic comedy Valentine's Day; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love.[15]
Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel The Art of Racing in the Rain in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in.[16] The project has not been able to find a director.[17] He starred as Dylan Gould in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011).[18][19]
In 2013, Dempsey starred in the romantic comedy Wonderful Tonight opposite Amanda Seyfried.[20]
Grey's Anatomy[edit]
Main article: Grey's Anatomy
Dempsey has received significant public attention for his role as Dr. Derek Shepherd (McDreamy) in the drama Grey's Anatomy. Prior to landing the role, Dempsey auditioned for the role of Dr. Chase on another medical show, House. He also appeared in two episodes of the Grey's spinoff Private Practice, playing the same character.[12] In January 2014, He signed a two-year contract to remain on Grey's Anatomy, then in its tenth season, that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons.[21][22][23]
Dempsey was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series–Drama at the 2006 Golden Globes for the role. His success on the show has led to his becoming a spokesman for Mazda and State Farm Insurance.[24][25] BuddyTV ranked him #1 on its list of "TV's Sexiest Men of 2011".[26]
Following his departure from Grey's Anatomy, Dempsey was working on two small-screen projects: a drama The Limit for SundanceTV and a travelogue spy thriller called Fodors. He also said: "I would love to do something else. I’m going to take the rest of the year off to develop. I would like to be a producer. I would commit to a show that is 10 to 12 episodes. But 24 again, I don’t know if I would do that. It's a very hard life. It's financially rewarding but there comes a point where how much is enough, really? I’m focusing now on developing and racing and being a father to my children."[27]
Promotional work[edit]
He has been the face of L'Oreal and Versace and was featured in ads for Serengeti sunglasses. In November 2008, he launched an Avon fragrance named Unscripted, and due to its success, a second fragrance named Patrick Dempsey 2 was launched in October 2009.[needs update] On September 29, 2012, Mexican cable company Cablemás, Megacable and Mexico city's Cablevisión launched an advertising campaign featuring Patrick Dempsey as the love interest of a domestic worker who comes across his profile on an online dating site.[28] Starting in 2013, Patrick Dempsey is the face of Silhouette, promoting eyewear fashion from Austria.[29] From January 2017 Dempsey is testimonial of Vodafone Italy and he appear in some Italian spot about it.[30]
Auto racing[edit]

In 2014, Dempsey told Reuters in the Hockenheimring support paddock at the German Grand Prix that motor racing was not just a hobby, and had become as much a part of who he is as acting. He said, "It's all-consuming in many ways. I couldn't imagine not racing right now. It really keeps me motivated. It's all I think about on a daily basis."[31]
Dempsey, who maintains an extensive sports and vintage car collection, has enjoyed auto racing in his spare time for several years, and declared before the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2013 that he would like to compete full-time, telling Eurosport:

I would like to make that [motorsports] a complete priority and just focus on this full-time. If I could just walk away from acting, I think I could do that very easily, and just focus on the driving, I would love that more than anything else.

He has competed in prestigious pro-am events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car race, and Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. He was a co-owner of the Vision Racing IndyCar Series team and current owner of Dempsey Racing, which is presently racing two Porsche 911 GT America's in the Tudor United Sports Car Series. He participated in this series as often as his schedule allowed, although insurance restrictions kept him from driving competitively while also filming a motion picture. In 2009, he raced a Team Seattle Advanced Engineering Ferrari F430 GT in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans's GT2 class and finished ninth in class.[32]
Dempsey announced he would race the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona along with other races throughout the season in a Mazda RX-8.[33]
Dempsey finished in third place in the GT Class of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. In 2012, Dempsey competed in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Racing-Multimatic Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which, after five successful racing seasons in Europe, was to make its debut on American tracks. He formed the Dempsey Racing team to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The team fielded a full-time Oreca FLM09 in the Prototype Challenge class as well as a Lola B12/80 coupe in the Prototype 2 class from Laguna Seca onward.[citation needed]
After debuting at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey returned to France four years later and competed in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Dempsey and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and fourth in-class.[citation needed]
Telling Porsche Newsroom: "Not much changes in my TV work, but everything changes constantly in motor racing – every lap, every bend and every moment."[34]
In 2015, Dempsey is focusing on participating in the FIA World Endurance Championship with his own Dempsey Racing-Proton team in the GTE-Am class in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR, teamed with Patrick Long and Marco Seefried.

Tully's Coffee[edit]
In January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully's Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.[35]
Following a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas owner Michael Avenatti, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan "exorbitant" and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully's operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Avenatti's office issued a second statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company "all the best". Avenatti has stated the dispute was a "misunderstanding" and will continue operating with other investors and new management.[36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. As a result, it is necessary for him to memorize all his lines in order to perform, even for auditions where he was unlikely to get the part.[38][39]
Entertainment Weekly put Dempsey's hair on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "What made Grey's Anatomy a mega-medi-hit? It could have something to do with creator Shonda Rhimes' scalpel-sharp writing…or McDreamy's impossibly luxurious man hair. Just saying."[40] In 2005, People magazine ranked him second in its annual list of "Sexiest Men Alive"[41] and again in 2006.[42]
Dempsey has been married twice. In 1987,[3] he married his manager,[43] actress and acting coach, Rochelle "Rocky" Parker, when he was 21 and she 48.[2] She appeared with Dempsey in the film In the Mood. While it has been reported that Dempsey married his best friend's mother, he has been quoted saying that he became best friends with Parker's son only after he became romantically involved with Parker. The couple divorced in 1994. She died in 2014.[44]
On July 31, 1999, Dempsey married hairstylist and makeup artist Jillian Fink.[43] The couple have three children, daughter Talula Fyfe[43][44][45] (born February 20, 2002), and twin sons Sullivan Patrick and Darby Galen (born February 1, 2007).[5][44] In January 2015, Fink filed for divorce,[46] but the couple reconciled later in the year.[47] They called off their divorce on November 12, 2016.[48]
Dempsey supports Rangers F.C.[49]
Cancer-research philanthropy[edit]
In 1997, Dempsey's mother, Amanda, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which subsequently relapsed five times. On March 24, 2014, she died in Lewiston, Maine, aged 79.[50] In response to his mother's bouts with cancer, Dempsey helped start the Patrick Dempsey Center at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. In October 2009, when Dempsey introduced the first Dempsey Challenge, registration was closed after reaching the goal of 3,500 cyclists, runners and walkers. The event raised more than $1 million for the cancer center. His mother was in the crowd as Dempsey finished his 50-mile ride.[51] The Challenge has since become an annual October event presented by Amgen in the Lewiston–Auburn area.[52] On May 28, 2017, Dempsey received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in his hometown, Lewiston, Maine for his philanthropy in the town and funding of "the Dempsey Center — just blocks from the Bates campus."[53]
Dempsey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin College in 2013 for his philanthropic work.[54] His Grey's Anatomy character Derek Shepherd had been written as a Bowdoin graduate after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to "adopt" the character as an alumnus.[55]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
