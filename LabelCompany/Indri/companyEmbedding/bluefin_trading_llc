We believe that the fluid exchange of ideas is critical to successfully adapt to dynamic and evolving markets.
The Bluefin partners facilitate the active evolution of ideas and strategies through an open dialogue between partners, traders, IT professionals and support staff. Teamwork is critical within our casual, yet intense environment. We subject ideas to rigorous debate and constantly test ourselves against the market. We seek employees who can add value to the process by developing a deep understanding of the markets, its trends and behavior, and can deploy that knowledge through building systems and trading the markets. Successful employees have an entrepreneurial spirit and thrive in an environment that rewards thinking outside the box. We value intellect, creativity, integrity, and expertise in all forms.


Bluefin Trading, the first Firm in the Bluefin Companies, was founded in 2001.
Initially, the firm focused on Equity and ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) trading on the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After gaining a solid foothold in the equity and equity derivative markets, Bluefin expanded to equity option and initiated energy derivatives trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2002. This led an expansion into the commodity markets with trading in the energy, agricultural and metals markets in New York and Chicago. The firm also expanded into the European and Asian equity and derivative markets. Over the next few years, Bluefin continued to develop new quantitative trading and investment strategies and has made a substantial commitment to trading and investing in fixed income.

Assistant traders also have the opportunity to participate in the research and development of new trading opportunities. Daily duties include profit and loss reconciliation, executing basic trades, and acting as liaison between traders and back office. Proven team players of high integrity will be promoted to risking the Firm’s capital by trading existing and/or new strategies once they exhibit the requisite skills, typically between 10 and 18 months after beginning a career with Bluefin.
