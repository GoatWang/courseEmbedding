Early life[edit]
Eisenson earned a BA in economics summa cum laude from Williams College, where he now serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and a JD/MBA (1981) from Yale University.[2]
Career[edit]
Eisenson previously managed certain assets of Harvard Management Company, where he worked from 1986 until the founding of Charlesbank, ultimately rising to managing director.[3][4] From 1986 to 1988, Eisenson worked with a branch of Harvard Management Company, Harvard Private Capital Group, Inc., which solely managed the investment portfolio of Harvard University. [5] Prior to his tenure at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was with the management consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group.[6]
While at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was the Harvard representative on the Board of Harken Energy when Harken purchased Spectrum VII, the oil company venture founded by George W. Bush.[7][8][9] Harvard ultimately made a small profit on the transaction.[10]
A private equity firm, Charlesbank focuses on leveraged buyouts involving middle-market companies, companies with enterprise values of between $150 million and $1.5 billion.[11] The firm has more than $3.4 billion in total assets. Charlesbank invests on behalf of pension funds, foundations, and endowments.[12] Eisenson has said that he knows he is not always investing in the most glamorous industries, but said, "What we’re looking for are businesses that are undervalued by other people. Our hope is to find the $20 bill that looks like $5 to other people." Eisenson has also said that he will not make money "off misery and poor people," by investing in things like collections agencies.[13]
The name of the firm, Charlesbank, refers both to the Charles River that flows through Boston as well as the firm's history and connection to Harvard University, situated on the Charles. When the company was Harvard Management Company, the group managed a portfolio only for Harvard. Today, the firm has offices in New York City as well as Boston.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Eisenson serves on the Board of Directors of Penske Auto Group, StoneCastle Partners and United Road Services. In 2017, he received the Myra H. Kraft Award for Non-Profit Leadership from the National Association for Corporate Directors. In 2011, he was recognized by the Outstanding Directors Exchange for his significant boardroom contributions.[15] Eisenson is a trustee of The Boston Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Williams College,[16] trustee of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Vice Chairman of the Board of Berklee College of Music.[17] He is also a founding director of Horizons for Homeless Children [18] and was the 2013 recipient of the James J. Pallotta Award, given by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay in recognition of his significant contributions to help at-risk children.[19]
Eisenson and his wife Barbara live in Wayland, Massachusetts and they have four children.[20]
Eisenson has contributed to the political campaigns of Barack Obama, Martha Coakley, John Kerry, and Mitt Romney, among others.[21]
He enjoys skiing, travel, tennis, and music.[22]

Michael R. Eisenson


Nationality
American


Alma mater
Williams College
Yale University


Occupation
Private equity investor


Employer
Charlesbank Capital Partners


Michael R. Eisenson is co-founder, managing director and chief executive officer of Charlesbank Capital Partners, LLC, a private equity investment firm based in Boston and New York. Founded in 1998, Charlesbank raised its most recent fund, Charlesbank Equity Fund VIII, in 2014. [1]

Early life[edit]
Eisenson earned a BA in economics summa cum laude from Williams College, where he now serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and a JD/MBA (1981) from Yale University.[2]
Career[edit]
Eisenson previously managed certain assets of Harvard Management Company, where he worked from 1986 until the founding of Charlesbank, ultimately rising to managing director.[3][4] From 1986 to 1988, Eisenson worked with a branch of Harvard Management Company, Harvard Private Capital Group, Inc., which solely managed the investment portfolio of Harvard University. [5] Prior to his tenure at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was with the management consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group.[6]
While at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was the Harvard representative on the Board of Harken Energy when Harken purchased Spectrum VII, the oil company venture founded by George W. Bush.[7][8][9] Harvard ultimately made a small profit on the transaction.[10]
A private equity firm, Charlesbank focuses on leveraged buyouts involving middle-market companies, companies with enterprise values of between $150 million and $1.5 billion.[11] The firm has more than $3.4 billion in total assets. Charlesbank invests on behalf of pension funds, foundations, and endowments.[12] Eisenson has said that he knows he is not always investing in the most glamorous industries, but said, "What we’re looking for are businesses that are undervalued by other people. Our hope is to find the $20 bill that looks like $5 to other people." Eisenson has also said that he will not make money "off misery and poor people," by investing in things like collections agencies.[13]
The name of the firm, Charlesbank, refers both to the Charles River that flows through Boston as well as the firm's history and connection to Harvard University, situated on the Charles. When the company was Harvard Management Company, the group managed a portfolio only for Harvard. Today, the firm has offices in New York City as well as Boston.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Eisenson serves on the Board of Directors of Penske Auto Group, StoneCastle Partners and United Road Services. In 2017, he received the Myra H. Kraft Award for Non-Profit Leadership from the National Association for Corporate Directors. In 2011, he was recognized by the Outstanding Directors Exchange for his significant boardroom contributions.[15] Eisenson is a trustee of The Boston Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Williams College,[16] trustee of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Vice Chairman of the Board of Berklee College of Music.[17] He is also a founding director of Horizons for Homeless Children [18] and was the 2013 recipient of the James J. Pallotta Award, given by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay in recognition of his significant contributions to help at-risk children.[19]
Eisenson and his wife Barbara live in Wayland, Massachusetts and they have four children.[20]
Eisenson has contributed to the political campaigns of Barack Obama, Martha Coakley, John Kerry, and Mitt Romney, among others.[21]
He enjoys skiing, travel, tennis, and music.[22]

Early life[edit]
Eisenson earned a BA in economics summa cum laude from Williams College, where he now serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and a JD/MBA (1981) from Yale University.[2]
Career[edit]
Eisenson previously managed certain assets of Harvard Management Company, where he worked from 1986 until the founding of Charlesbank, ultimately rising to managing director.[3][4] From 1986 to 1988, Eisenson worked with a branch of Harvard Management Company, Harvard Private Capital Group, Inc., which solely managed the investment portfolio of Harvard University. [5] Prior to his tenure at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was with the management consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group.[6]
While at Harvard Management Company, Eisenson was the Harvard representative on the Board of Harken Energy when Harken purchased Spectrum VII, the oil company venture founded by George W. Bush.[7][8][9] Harvard ultimately made a small profit on the transaction.[10]
A private equity firm, Charlesbank focuses on leveraged buyouts involving middle-market companies, companies with enterprise values of between $150 million and $1.5 billion.[11] The firm has more than $3.4 billion in total assets. Charlesbank invests on behalf of pension funds, foundations, and endowments.[12] Eisenson has said that he knows he is not always investing in the most glamorous industries, but said, "What we’re looking for are businesses that are undervalued by other people. Our hope is to find the $20 bill that looks like $5 to other people." Eisenson has also said that he will not make money "off misery and poor people," by investing in things like collections agencies.[13]
The name of the firm, Charlesbank, refers both to the Charles River that flows through Boston as well as the firm's history and connection to Harvard University, situated on the Charles. When the company was Harvard Management Company, the group managed a portfolio only for Harvard. Today, the firm has offices in New York City as well as Boston.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Eisenson serves on the Board of Directors of Penske Auto Group, StoneCastle Partners and United Road Services. In 2017, he received the Myra H. Kraft Award for Non-Profit Leadership from the National Association for Corporate Directors. In 2011, he was recognized by the Outstanding Directors Exchange for his significant boardroom contributions.[15] Eisenson is a trustee of The Boston Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Williams College,[16] trustee of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Vice Chairman of the Board of Berklee College of Music.[17] He is also a founding director of Horizons for Homeless Children [18] and was the 2013 recipient of the James J. Pallotta Award, given by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay in recognition of his significant contributions to help at-risk children.[19]
Eisenson and his wife Barbara live in Wayland, Massachusetts and they have four children.[20]
Eisenson has contributed to the political campaigns of Barack Obama, Martha Coakley, John Kerry, and Mitt Romney, among others.[21]
He enjoys skiing, travel, tennis, and music.[22]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
