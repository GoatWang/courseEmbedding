Why Choose Us?
The BP Capital TwinLine Funds were launched to permit “twinning” alongside the investment philosophy of Boone Pickens. Much like the practice of midstream companies who lay new pipe alongside an existing pipeline in an effort to leverage existing infrastructure (a practice known as “twinning” pipe), the BP Capital TwinLine Funds allow you to leverage the industry knowledge, investment experience, deep relationships and trust accrued over the past 60 years. Our two funds, the BP Capital TwinLine Energy Fund and BP Capital TwinLine MLP Fund, and our Separately Managed Accounts offerings were designed to offer optimal exposure to our highest conviction investment themes surrounding the American energy revolution and industrial renaissance.
 
 
 





Focus
						 The Funds invest in companies across the full spectrum of the energy supply-demand value chain which the Advisor believes are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities related to the American Energy and Industrial Renaissance. 
					
 
 



Experience
Our funds gain a unique perspective (informational alpha) in the energy investment landscape from our affiliation with BP Capital, which manages commodity/energy equity hedge funds and holds private assets and mineral interests.


 
 



Insights
						 The Funds leverage insights gained through energy sector knowledge, investment experience, deep relationships and trust earned over the past 60 years to create value for Clients.
