Client Service Excellence
We have been dedicated to serving the investment needs of private clients since our inception. We work closely with these individuals  to develop an investment policy and asset mix strategy customized to their  specific financial objectives, time horizon, risk sensitivity, cash flow needs, and tax considerations.
Our account minimum for private clients is $2 million. We provide portfolio statements as frequently as monthly and detailed portfolio performance every quarter. Clients also have real-time access to their investment portfolios via our online portal. We  meet with our private clients at least once a year to review their investment policies and to  outline future strategies.
Investment Options – Segregated and Pooled
We offer access to FGP’s pooled funds which provide an economical and efficient way to diversify. In certain cases, we offer  segregated portfolio management where we select  individual securities for our private clients.
For each asset category, we offer a series of FGP pooled funds specifically designed for tax-exempt private accounts (such as RRSPs, RRIFs) and another series designed for taxable private accounts. 
While these pooled funds are similar to mutual funds, they do not require prospectuses and are therefore considered private offerings available to our clients only, subject to meeting certain minimum investment requirements.

Access Our Expertise Through Partnerships
We have created partnerships with a number of investment companies who want their individual investors to have access to top institutional money managers. Individual investors who may not have access to the account minimums to invest privately with us can access our expertise at much lower minimums, ranging from $5,000 for mutual fund investing to $100,000 or more for separately-managed account programs.
We act as sub-advisor for a number of separately-managed account programs (also known as wrap programs), mutual funds, and one pooled fund wrap program. Each sub-advisory relationship is treated as a direct institutional client, with our investment management customized to meet the needs of program sponsors and their clients.
Our portfolio managers and research teams manage our sub-advisory portfolios. Our client service professionals are also actively involved in the investment process to ensure that program sponsors always receive timely and accurate information.

Firm History






















Firm History










Three partners – Donald Foyston, Peter Gordon and Malcolm Payne – launched Foyston, Gordon & Payne (FGP) in 1980.  Each partner brought extensive expertise and experience to the firm – with deep knowledge of the institutional investment and private money management business. With a belief in the discipline and success of value style investing, FGP soon developed strong connections with clients based on trust and integrity – backed by disciplined research and analysis of the quality and value of potential investments.
More than three decades later, our firm has grown to over 50 employees while continuing to invest in high-quality companies with attractive valuations – just as our original partners did.
While our firm is supported by an equity interest from Affiliated Managers Group’s (AMG), FGP remains a completely autonomous business. In fact, almost 40 percent of FGP is owned by its employees, firmly aligning our interests with those of our clients. Just as our investment team manages portfolios for our institutional and private clients, we also participate in the management of our own company. When our clients do well, we do well – and our history of collective success speaks to the power of disciplined excellence that has always set us apart.

high quality, sustainable earnings should contribute to producing excellent 
longer-term value-added results.  The firm’s portfolio managers and analysts use

the key focus and is the primary determinant of the excellent long term results 
provided to FGP’s clients.FGP’s research analysts form the core of 
the firm’s research and analysis. The analysts’ focus is to generate new 
investment ideas by putting stocks and bonds through screens for value 
characteristics, quality attributes, and recent price changes. They also keep a 
close eye on securities already in the portfolio.The portfolio 
managers make the final decisions on new additions to the portfolios they 
manage. They look for input and constructive criticism from their analysts and 
the Investment Committee, and weigh that input before making a final decision. 
Within the portfolio, the portfolio managers use a model weighting system that 
takes into consideration input from the analysts in addition to their own 
judgment of each security’s best overall value in the 
portfolio.The FirmThree partners launched FGP 
in 1980 to provide portfolio management services to organizations and high net 
worth individuals. More than three decades later, the firm continues to invest

Access Our Expertise Through Partnerships
We have created partnerships with a number of investment companies who want their individual investors to have access to top institutional money managers. Individual investors who may not have access to the account minimums to invest privately with us can access our expertise at much lower minimums, ranging from $5,000 for mutual fund investing to $100,000 or more for separately-managed account programs.
We act as sub-advisor for a number of separately-managed account programs (also known as wrap programs), mutual funds, and one pooled fund wrap program. Each sub-advisory relationship is treated as a direct institutional client, with our investment management customized to meet the needs of program sponsors and their clients.
Our portfolio managers and research teams manage our sub-advisory portfolios. Our client service professionals are also actively involved in the investment process to ensure that program sponsors always receive timely and accurate information.
