About Us
Landmark Dividend LLC is one of the nation’s largest and most successful ground lease acquisition companies. We provide value, capital and liquidity to qualified property owners who lease their property for cell towers, billboards, wind turbines, utility-scale solar farms and fiber optic networks.

Landmark Dividend is the General Partner of its publicly-traded subsidiary, Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP.  Landmark Infrastructure Partners was formed to acquire, own and manage a portfolio of real property interests leased to companies in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries.  Landmark Infrastructure Partners is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol LMRK; more information can be found at www.landmarkmlp.com.
Whether you have a ground lease for a billboard that has been in your family for generations, a cell site with one or multiple wireless tenants, or hold a lease to renewable energy asset or fiber optic cables, we understand that your asset is important to you and generates income. Yet with the uncertain financial climate and ever-changing regulatory environment, you may be questioning the potential risks of relying on the income from these assets.
What if you could get the liquidity you need in a lump-sum cash payout – right now? What if you had the upfront cash to invest in another real estate asset or business, send your kids to college, fund your retirements, pay off your mortgage or explore other opportunities? With our capital solutions, you can! Landmark Dividend can help you maximize the value of your property today in order to secure your future. We have a passion for creating value for property owners just like you. It’s our only business.

Billboard Lease
Landmark Dividend is a ground lease acquisition company. Our clients include individuals, corporations, municipalities, faith-based organizations, government institutions and any other type of entity that may own a ground lease.
You can take 100% control of your billboard lease!
Billboard lease buyouts are an important and growing part of our business. As one of the nation’s most successful ground lease acquisition company, Landmark Dividend meets with thousands of property owners every year to determine if a billboard lease buyout makes sense for them.
Although rent reduction or decommissioning of your billboard lease is possible, the risk is statistically low. The far greater risk is opportunity cost. That means losing out on the opportunity to earn better growth from a financial asset. Applied to your billboard lease, it means that investing the cash proceeds from the sale of your lease can often provide significantly stronger growth over the next 10, 20 or 30 years, compared to the cumulative monthly rent in that same time period.
The exciting news is that you can take 100% control of your billboard lease’s value while simultaneously reducing risk. Landmark Dividend offers an immediate cash payment in exchange for your lease. Any future rent reduction or site decommissioning would not affect this transaction. No matter what happens to the billboard lease on your property, you get to keep 100% of the proceeds from the sale of your lease. In addition, selling your lease does not in any way affect your ownership of your land, including the ability to sell it in the future.
What is your billboard lease worth? Find out FREE!
Even if you don’t need cash right now, doesn’t it make sense to know the market value of your lease? If your site meets our criteria, we can provide you with a no-obligation analysis and valuation. Please call us at 1-844-722-0113 or click here to submit your information online so that we may contact you.

Solar Farm Lease
Solar farm lease buyouts are a growing part of our renewable energy infrastructure business. If you are receiving rent for solar panels on your property as part of a utility-scale solar farm, we are interested in speaking to you about your ground lease. If your site qualifies, we will buy your solar farm lease for a substantial lump sum cash payment.
You can take 100% control of your solar farm lease!
Although rent reduction or decommissioning of your solar farm lease is possible, the risk is statistically low. The far greater risk is opportunity cost. That means losing out on the opportunity to earn better growth from a financial asset. Applied to your solar farm lease, it means that investing the cash proceeds from the sale of your lease can often provide significantly stronger growth over the next 10, 20 or 30 years, compared to the cumulative monthly rent in that same time period.
The exciting news is that you can take 100% control of your solar farm lease’s value while simultaneously reducing risk. Landmark Dividend offers an immediate cash payment in exchange for your lease. Any future rent reduction or site decommissioning would not affect this transaction. No matter what happens to the lease on your property, you get to keep 100% of the proceeds from the sale of your lease. In addition, selling your lease does not in any way affect your ownership of your land, including the ability to sell it in the future.
