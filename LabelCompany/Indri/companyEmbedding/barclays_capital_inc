A consolidated platform for sales and trading of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative products.








Understanding the interconnectivity between rates, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities markets has become increasingly important to both our institutional and corporate clients. Our Macro business combines coverage of these asset classes to respond better to their needs.






Barclays has long been a recognised leader in rates and foreign exchange products, and we combine this strength with our focused commodities derivatives and local emerging markets businesses. Our teams, based in financial hubs across the globe, can assist clients with anticipating the impact of macro market moves and events on their portfolios. For example, the impact of central bank interest rate decisions on currency markets, or the relationship between the price of oil and the performance of emerging market currencies.
We strive to give clients the critical short-term and thematic insights they need to effectively manage their portfolios, and partner with them to structure, buy and sell products to meet their hedging and investment goals. Our trading desks specialise in understanding flows across rates, FX and commodities markets, including:

government bonds
interest rate derivatives
inflation-linked products
spot foreign exchange
forwards and options
financial oil
US financial gas
index products

Product Summary




iPath® S&P 500 VIX Short-Term FuturesTM ETN 






The  iPath® S&P 500 VIX Short-Term FuturesTM ETNs (the "ETNs") are designed to provide exposure to the S&P 500 VIX  Short-Term FuturesTM Index  Total Return (the "Index").  The ETNs are  riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal  protection.  The ETNs are unsecured debt  obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or  indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party.  Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including  any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays  Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due.  An investment in the ETNs involves  significant risks, including possible loss of principal and may not be suitable  for all investors. 
The Index is designed to provide access to equity  market volatility through CBOE Volatility Index® (the "VIX Index")  futures. The Index offers exposure to a daily  rolling long position in the first and second month VIX futures contracts and  reflects market participants’ views of the future direction of the VIX index at  the time of expiration of the VIX futures contracts comprising the Index. Owning the ETNs is not the same as owning interests in the index components  included in the Index or a security directly linked to the performance of the  Index.For additional information regarding the risks  associated with the ETNs, please see "Selected Risk Considerations" below.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold or redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.  See additional information below for how return figures are calculated.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS

Intraday  Indicative Value.  The "intraday indicative value"  meant to approximate the value of the ETNs during the current trading day by  reference to the underlying index is calculated and published during the course  of each trading day.  The intraday  indicative value is intended to provide investors with an approximation of  the effect that intraday changes in the level of the underlying index would  have on the closing indicative value of the ETNs.  The intraday indicative value only reflects  the accrued investor fee and other applicable costs at the close of business on  the preceding day, but does not include any adjustment for the investor fee or  applicable costs accruing during the course of the current day.  For more information on how the intraday  indicative value is calculated, please see the section "Valuation of the ETNs"  in the prospectus relating to the ETNs. 
  The intraday indicative value is provided for reference purposes only. It  is not intended as a price or quotation, or as an offer or solicitation for the  purchase, sale, redemption or termination of the ETNs, nor does it reflect  hedging or transaction costs, credit considerations, market liquidity, or  bid-offer spreads. Published index levels from the sponsors of the indices  underlying the ETNs may occasionally be subject to delay or postponement. Any  such delays or postponements will affect the level of the index and therefore  the intraday indicative value of the ETNs. Index levels provided by the  sponsors of the indices underlying the ETNs do not necessarily reflect the  depth and liquidity of the underlying markets for the index components. For  this reason and others, the actual trading price of the ETNs may be different  from their intraday indicative value.
The investor  fee rate per ETN is 0.89% per year. The investor fee on the inception date was  zero.  On each subsequent calendar day  until maturity or early redemption, the investor fee will be equal to (1) The Investor Fee Rate times (2) the closing indicative note  value on the immediately preceding calendar day times (3) the daily index factor on that day (or, if such day is  not an index business day, one) divided  by (4) 365.  The daily index  factor on any index business day will equal (1) the closing level of the Index  on such index business day divided by (2)  the closing level of the Index on the immediately preceding business day.  
Market Capitalization = Closing Indicative  Note Value x ETNs Outstanding

An investment in the iPath ETNs described herein (the "ETNs") involves risks,  including possible loss of principal, and may not be suitable for all  investors.  Selected risks are summarized  here and select  product specific risk factors are summarized under "Select Risk Considerations"  on the relevant product pages, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable product  prospectus.
You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the level of the underlying index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date.  Additionally, if the level of the underlying index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of such index level has increased or decreased, as the case may be.  Because the ETNs are subject to an investor fee and other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.   The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party.   Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or  upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its  obligations as they come due.  As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or  redemption.  In addition, in the event  Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any  amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.
The  Performance of the Underlying Indices are Unpredictable: An investment in the ETNs is subject to risks  associated with fluctuations, particularly a decline, in the performance of the  underlying index. Because the performance of such index is linked to futures  contracts on the CBOE® Volatility Index (the "VIX Index"), the  performance of the underlying index will depend on many factors including, the  level of the S&P 500® Index, the prices of options on the  S&P 500® Index, and the level of the VIX Index which may change  unpredictably, affecting the value of futures contracts on the VIX Index and,  consequently, the level of the underlying index. Additional factors that may  contribute to fluctuations in the level of such index include prevailing market  prices and forward volatility levels of the U.S. stock markets and the equity  securities included in the S&P 500® Index, the prevailing market  prices of options on the VIX Index, relevant futures contracts on the VIX  Index, or any other financial instruments related to the S&P 500®  Index and the VIX Index, interest rates, supply and demand in the listed and  over-the-counter equity derivative markets as well as hedging activities in the  equity-linked structured product markets.
Your  ETNs Are Not Linked to the VIX Index:  The value of your ETNs will be linked to the value  of the underlying index, and your ability to benefit from any rise or fall in  the level of the VIX Index is limited. The index underlying your ETNs is based  upon holding a rolling long position in futures on the VIX Index. These futures  will not necessarily track the performance of the VIX Index. Your ETNs may not  benefit from increases in the level of the VIX Index because such increases  will not necessarily cause the level of VIX Index futures to rise. Accordingly,  a hypothetical investment that was linked directly to the VIX Index could generate  a higher return than your investment in the ETNs.
Market and Volatility Risk:  The market value of  the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate  between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date.  You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary  market.  Factors that may influence the  market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the U.S. stock  markets, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing  market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments  related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic,  financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect  the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index.
A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs.
No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 25,000 ETNs of the same series at one time in order to  exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date.  You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption  date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times  as set forth in the product prospectus.
Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation.

Index Components(as of 07/25/2017)

An investment in the iPath ETNs described herein (the "ETNs") involves risks,  including possible loss of principal, and may not be suitable for all  investors.  Selected risks are summarized  here and select  product specific risk factors are summarized under "Select Risk Considerations"  on the relevant product pages, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable product  prospectus.
You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the level of the underlying index between the inception date and the applicable valuation date.  Additionally, if the level of the underlying index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of such index level has increased or decreased, as the case may be.  Because the ETNs are subject to an investor fee and other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.   The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party.   Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or  upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its  obligations as they come due.  As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or  redemption.  In addition, in the event  Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any  amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.
The  Performance of the Underlying Indices are Unpredictable: An investment in the ETNs is subject to risks  associated with fluctuations, particularly a decline, in the performance of the  underlying index. Because the performance of such index is linked to futures  contracts on the CBOE® Volatility Index (the "VIX Index"), the  performance of the underlying index will depend on many factors including, the  level of the S&P 500® Index, the prices of options on the  S&P 500® Index, and the level of the VIX Index which may change  unpredictably, affecting the value of futures contracts on the VIX Index and,  consequently, the level of the underlying index. Additional factors that may  contribute to fluctuations in the level of such index include prevailing market  prices and forward volatility levels of the U.S. stock markets and the equity  securities included in the S&P 500® Index, the prevailing market  prices of options on the VIX Index, relevant futures contracts on the VIX  Index, or any other financial instruments related to the S&P 500®  Index and the VIX Index, interest rates, supply and demand in the listed and  over-the-counter equity derivative markets as well as hedging activities in the  equity-linked structured product markets.
Your  ETNs Are Not Linked to the VIX Index:  The value of your ETNs will be linked to the value  of the underlying index, and your ability to benefit from any rise or fall in  the level of the VIX Index is limited. The index underlying your ETNs is based  upon holding a rolling long position in futures on the VIX Index. These futures  will not necessarily track the performance of the VIX Index. Your ETNs may not  benefit from increases in the level of the VIX Index because such increases  will not necessarily cause the level of VIX Index futures to rise. Accordingly,  a hypothetical investment that was linked directly to the VIX Index could generate  a higher return than your investment in the ETNs.
Market and Volatility Risk:  The market value of  the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate  between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date.  You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary  market.  Factors that may influence the  market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the U.S. stock  markets, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing  market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments  related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic,  financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect  the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index.
A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs.
No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 25,000 ETNs of the same series at one time in order to  exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date.  You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption  date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times  as set forth in the product prospectus.
Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation.
Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration statement  (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.iPathETN.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling 212-528-7990,  or you may request a copy from any other dealer participating in  the offering.

Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011), was a case decided in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where the Second Circuit, reversing the decision[1] of the US District Court below it, found that the claims of three major financial investment firms (Barclays Investment Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) against an internet subscription stock news service (theflyonthewall.com) for "Hot-news" Misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand, as they were pre-empted by several sections of the Federal Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106, 17 U.S.C. § 102, and 17 U.S.C. § 103).[2]
The case was significant because the Second Circuit redefined elements of the "Hot-news" Misappropriation tort, breaking with earlier Second Circuit precedent by holding that such precedent was not binding, but merely obiter dicta.[2] According to some legal commentators, the decision would have the effect of making it more difficult for future plaintiffs to bring claims under the hot-news misappropriation doctrine, at least in the Second Circuit.[3]

Story of the Case[edit]
The defendant, Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., was a company that was in the business of obtaining, by various means, daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs, Lehman Brothers (later purchased by Barclays Investment Bank), Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, in their highly sought-after research reports. The defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public. The plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports' exclusivity, accuracy, and timely release (they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open) and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients, to entice clients to execute stock trades through them, and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients.[4]
On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Theflyonthewall.com ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them.[5] The plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims: 1) claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and; 2) claims that the defendant had committed the common-law tort of "hot-news" misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports.[6]
In the procedural lead-up to the trial, the defendants essentially conceded their liability under the copyright claim. Thus, at a bench trial before the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the remaining issues to be tried were the appropriate relief for the copyright claim, as well as liability and relief for the hot-news misappropriation claim.[7] On March 18, 2010, the District Court found in favour of the plaintiffs, issuing an injunction ordering the defendants to cease their publication of the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations (see summary of the court's decision below.)
Shortly thereafter,[8] the defendants appealed the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hot-news misappropriation findings. They argued that the District Court had erred in finding that the hot-news misappropriation claim had been established, that the claim (made under state law) was pre-empted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation, and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted, was overbroad, and violated the defendant's free speech rights under the First Amendment.[9]
On June 20, 2011, the Second Circuit released its decision - reversing the decision of the District Court below, and instructing it to dismiss the claim.[10] A summary of the Second Circuit's decision can also be found below.
Opinion of the District Court[edit]
Hot News Misappropriation[edit]
Hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action originated from International News Service v. Associated Press wherein the Supreme Court held that hot news, defined as time-sensitive information, is protectable as "quasi-property."[11] This misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to "protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable, time-sensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law."[12] Significantly, the 'hot' news doctrine is concerned with "the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge." [13][14] Given that the Copyright Act of 1976 deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works, different judges' holdings questioned the tort of hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action. These discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself. Seventy-nine years later, National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. ("NBA"),[15] provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a five-element test for determining hot-news misappropriation.
Test for Determining Hot-News Misappropriation[edit]
In Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., the court used the five-element test set out in NBA, which was cited in the District Court's opinion as follows:
1) A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;
2) The information is time-sensitive;
3) A defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;
4) The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs;
5) The ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.
[16]
District Court Ruling on Firms' Hot-News Misappropriation Claim[edit]
Element 1[edit]
The plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hot-news misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering.[17]
Element 2[edit]
The plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were held to be "clearly time-sensitive" by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs' clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement. Moreover, the time-sensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were time-sensitive.[18]
Element 3[edit]
For the third element concerning free-riding, the court found that the defendant's "core business [was] its free-riding off the sustained, costly efforts by the Firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors." The court defined free-riding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of "information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost."[19] Whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the "Recommendations" it published, and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the Recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs' expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis, the court found that defendant free-rode off of the plaintiffs' work.[20]
Element 4[edit]
The court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide time-sensitive information to clientele, and the defendant's dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for pre-market hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations. In doing so, the plaintiffs' clientele, already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news, were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including access-controlled media, license third-party distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients.[21]
Element 5[edit]
The court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendant's conduct, and others like the defendant, if allowed to continue, would be "likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs' ability to continue to participate in the market." The court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients. As such, if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs, the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic. Thus, the court argued that if the defendant, and others like it, were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs, they would lose their commission revenue, and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research, and discontinue their research production.
District Court Ruling on Firms' Copyright Claim and Resulting Remedy[edit]
The court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts."[22] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the statutory damage awards, and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" generated by those two plaintiffs.[23]
Opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal[edit]
The defendant appealed the rulings of the District Court on hot-news misappropriation to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On appeal, the Second Circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs' hot-news misappropriation claim was "preempted by federal copyright law."[24]
Federal Preemption[edit]
The Court recalled that in order to determine whether a state-law claim is preempted by the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 301 sets forth a two part test:

The General Scope Requirement: if the impugned state-law claim "seeks to vindicate 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent' to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17 U.S.C. § 106";

and

The Subject Matter Requirement: "if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. § 102 and 17 U.S.C. § 103."

The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the "subject matter" requirement as well as the "general scope" requirement of the Copyright Act.[24] They held that the hot-news misappropriation exemption from pre-emption carved out in the NBA case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope.[25] In addition, they characterized the 5-part test that was set out in NBA and applied by the District Court as obiter dictum.[26]
Judge Raggi, in a separate concurring opinion, disagreed with the majority that the NBA test was dictum, and would have held that although pre-emption occurred; the 5-part test was valid, but had been misapplied in the Court below.[27]
Organizations Concerned about the Second Circuit's Ruling[edit]
The case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Media Law Project, and Public Citizen, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Second Circuit court to take into consideration the First Amendment as it related to the district court judgement's potential restraints on Americans' abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day.
Google and Twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hot-news misappropriation tort. The Second Circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the court's power and not relevant to the case.
The Newspaper Association of America, The New York Times Company, Philadelphia Media Holdings, Stephens Media, Time, and the Washington Post filed an amicus brief.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Dow Jones & Company, and The Investorside Research Association each filed amicus briefs.
Second Circuit's Humorous Footnotes[edit]
Irony[edit]
In recounting the story of the case, the Second Circuit Court wrote that they "find little to take issue with in the district court's careful findings of facts, to which we must in any event defer. We therefore borrow freely from them." These sentences are followed by a footnote which reads, "The irony of doing so in the context of a copyright-infringement and 'hot news'-misappropriation case is not lost on us."" (Footnote 3).
Biblical References[edit]
The Second Circuit court comments on the district court's characterization of the defendant's behavior as having a "biblical" tone," where the district court asserts that the defendant had "reaped where it had not sown." This claim is then footnoted by the Second Circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the Bible: "In the Bible, that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise. See, e.g., Galatians 6:7: "God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." But cf. Leviticus 23:22, setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown."

Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011), was a case decided in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where the Second Circuit, reversing the decision[1] of the US District Court below it, found that the claims of three major financial investment firms (Barclays Investment Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) against an internet subscription stock news service (theflyonthewall.com) for "Hot-news" Misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand, as they were pre-empted by several sections of the Federal Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106, 17 U.S.C. § 102, and 17 U.S.C. § 103).[2]
The case was significant because the Second Circuit redefined elements of the "Hot-news" Misappropriation tort, breaking with earlier Second Circuit precedent by holding that such precedent was not binding, but merely obiter dicta.[2] According to some legal commentators, the decision would have the effect of making it more difficult for future plaintiffs to bring claims under the hot-news misappropriation doctrine, at least in the Second Circuit.[3]

Story of the Case[edit]
The defendant, Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., was a company that was in the business of obtaining, by various means, daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs, Lehman Brothers (later purchased by Barclays Investment Bank), Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, in their highly sought-after research reports. The defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public. The plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports' exclusivity, accuracy, and timely release (they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open) and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients, to entice clients to execute stock trades through them, and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients.[4]
On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Theflyonthewall.com ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them.[5] The plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims: 1) claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and; 2) claims that the defendant had committed the common-law tort of "hot-news" misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports.[6]
In the procedural lead-up to the trial, the defendants essentially conceded their liability under the copyright claim. Thus, at a bench trial before the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the remaining issues to be tried were the appropriate relief for the copyright claim, as well as liability and relief for the hot-news misappropriation claim.[7] On March 18, 2010, the District Court found in favour of the plaintiffs, issuing an injunction ordering the defendants to cease their publication of the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations (see summary of the court's decision below.)
Shortly thereafter,[8] the defendants appealed the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hot-news misappropriation findings. They argued that the District Court had erred in finding that the hot-news misappropriation claim had been established, that the claim (made under state law) was pre-empted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation, and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted, was overbroad, and violated the defendant's free speech rights under the First Amendment.[9]
On June 20, 2011, the Second Circuit released its decision - reversing the decision of the District Court below, and instructing it to dismiss the claim.[10] A summary of the Second Circuit's decision can also be found below.
Opinion of the District Court[edit]
Hot News Misappropriation[edit]
Hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action originated from International News Service v. Associated Press wherein the Supreme Court held that hot news, defined as time-sensitive information, is protectable as "quasi-property."[11] This misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to "protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable, time-sensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law."[12] Significantly, the 'hot' news doctrine is concerned with "the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge." [13][14] Given that the Copyright Act of 1976 deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works, different judges' holdings questioned the tort of hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action. These discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself. Seventy-nine years later, National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. ("NBA"),[15] provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a five-element test for determining hot-news misappropriation.
Test for Determining Hot-News Misappropriation[edit]
In Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., the court used the five-element test set out in NBA, which was cited in the District Court's opinion as follows:
1) A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;
2) The information is time-sensitive;
3) A defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;
4) The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs;
5) The ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.
[16]
District Court Ruling on Firms' Hot-News Misappropriation Claim[edit]
Element 1[edit]
The plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hot-news misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering.[17]
Element 2[edit]
The plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were held to be "clearly time-sensitive" by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs' clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement. Moreover, the time-sensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were time-sensitive.[18]
Element 3[edit]
For the third element concerning free-riding, the court found that the defendant's "core business [was] its free-riding off the sustained, costly efforts by the Firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors." The court defined free-riding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of "information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost."[19] Whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the "Recommendations" it published, and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the Recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs' expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis, the court found that defendant free-rode off of the plaintiffs' work.[20]
Element 4[edit]
The court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide time-sensitive information to clientele, and the defendant's dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for pre-market hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations. In doing so, the plaintiffs' clientele, already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news, were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including access-controlled media, license third-party distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients.[21]
Element 5[edit]
The court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendant's conduct, and others like the defendant, if allowed to continue, would be "likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs' ability to continue to participate in the market." The court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients. As such, if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs, the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic. Thus, the court argued that if the defendant, and others like it, were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs, they would lose their commission revenue, and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research, and discontinue their research production.
District Court Ruling on Firms' Copyright Claim and Resulting Remedy[edit]
The court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts."[22] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the statutory damage awards, and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" generated by those two plaintiffs.[23]
Opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal[edit]
The defendant appealed the rulings of the District Court on hot-news misappropriation to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On appeal, the Second Circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs' hot-news misappropriation claim was "preempted by federal copyright law."[24]
Federal Preemption[edit]
The Court recalled that in order to determine whether a state-law claim is preempted by the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 301 sets forth a two part test:

The General Scope Requirement: if the impugned state-law claim "seeks to vindicate 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent' to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17 U.S.C. § 106";

and

The Subject Matter Requirement: "if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. § 102 and 17 U.S.C. § 103."

The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the "subject matter" requirement as well as the "general scope" requirement of the Copyright Act.[24] They held that the hot-news misappropriation exemption from pre-emption carved out in the NBA case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope.[25] In addition, they characterized the 5-part test that was set out in NBA and applied by the District Court as obiter dictum.[26]
Judge Raggi, in a separate concurring opinion, disagreed with the majority that the NBA test was dictum, and would have held that although pre-emption occurred; the 5-part test was valid, but had been misapplied in the Court below.[27]
Organizations Concerned about the Second Circuit's Ruling[edit]
The case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Media Law Project, and Public Citizen, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Second Circuit court to take into consideration the First Amendment as it related to the district court judgement's potential restraints on Americans' abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day.
Google and Twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hot-news misappropriation tort. The Second Circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the court's power and not relevant to the case.
The Newspaper Association of America, The New York Times Company, Philadelphia Media Holdings, Stephens Media, Time, and the Washington Post filed an amicus brief.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Dow Jones & Company, and The Investorside Research Association each filed amicus briefs.
Second Circuit's Humorous Footnotes[edit]
Irony[edit]
In recounting the story of the case, the Second Circuit Court wrote that they "find little to take issue with in the district court's careful findings of facts, to which we must in any event defer. We therefore borrow freely from them." These sentences are followed by a footnote which reads, "The irony of doing so in the context of a copyright-infringement and 'hot news'-misappropriation case is not lost on us."" (Footnote 3).
Biblical References[edit]
The Second Circuit court comments on the district court's characterization of the defendant's behavior as having a "biblical" tone," where the district court asserts that the defendant had "reaped where it had not sown." This claim is then footnoted by the Second Circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the Bible: "In the Bible, that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise. See, e.g., Galatians 6:7: "God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." But cf. Leviticus 23:22, setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown."

Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011), was a case decided in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where the Second Circuit, reversing the decision[1] of the US District Court below it, found that the claims of three major financial investment firms (Barclays Investment Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) against an internet subscription stock news service (theflyonthewall.com) for "Hot-news" Misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand, as they were pre-empted by several sections of the Federal Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106, 17 U.S.C. § 102, and 17 U.S.C. § 103).[2]

Story of the Case[edit]
The defendant, Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., was a company that was in the business of obtaining, by various means, daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs, Lehman Brothers (later purchased by Barclays Investment Bank), Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, in their highly sought-after research reports. The defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public. The plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports' exclusivity, accuracy, and timely release (they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open) and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients, to entice clients to execute stock trades through them, and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients.[4]

They argued that the District Court had erred in finding that the hot-news misappropriation claim had been established, that the claim (made under state law) was pre-empted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation, and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted, was overbroad, and violated the defendant's free speech rights under the First Amendment.[9]
On June 20, 2011, the Second Circuit released its decision - reversing the decision of the District Court below, and instructing it to dismiss the claim.[10] A summary of the Second Circuit's decision can also be found below.
Opinion of the District Court[edit]
Hot News Misappropriation[edit]
Hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action originated from International News Service v. Associated Press wherein the Supreme Court held that hot news, defined as time-sensitive information, is protectable as "quasi-property."[11] This misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to "protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable, time-sensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law."[12] Significantly, the 'hot' news doctrine is concerned with "the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge." [13][14] Given that the Copyright Act of 1976 deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works, different judges' holdings questioned the tort of hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action. These discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself. Seventy-nine years later, National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. ("NBA"),[15] provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a five-element test for determining hot-news misappropriation.
Test for Determining Hot-News Misappropriation[edit]
In Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., the court used the five-element test set out in NBA, which was cited in the District Court's opinion as follows:
1) A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;
2) The information is time-sensitive;
3) A defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;
4) The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs;
5) The ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.
[16]
District Court Ruling on Firms' Hot-News Misappropriation Claim[edit]
Element 1[edit]
The plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hot-news misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering.[17]
Element 2[edit]
The plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were held to be "clearly time-sensitive" by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs' clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement. Moreover, the time-sensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were time-sensitive.[18]
Element 3[edit]
For the third element concerning free-riding, the court found that the defendant's "core business [was] its free-riding off the sustained, costly efforts by the Firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors." The court defined free-riding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of "information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost."[19] Whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the "Recommendations" it published, and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the Recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs' expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis, the court found that defendant free-rode off of the plaintiffs' work.[20]
Element 4[edit]
The court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide time-sensitive information to clientele, and the defendant's dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for pre-market hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations. In doing so, the plaintiffs' clientele, already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news, were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including access-controlled media, license third-party distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients.[21]
Element 5[edit]
The court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendant's conduct, and others like the defendant, if allowed to continue, would be "likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs' ability to continue to participate in the market." The court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients. As such, if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs, the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic. Thus, the court argued that if the defendant, and others like it, were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs, they would lose their commission revenue, and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research, and discontinue their research production.
District Court Ruling on Firms' Copyright Claim and Resulting Remedy[edit]
The court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts."[22] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the statutory damage awards, and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" generated by those two plaintiffs.[23]
Opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal[edit]
The defendant appealed the rulings of the District Court on hot-news misappropriation to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On appeal, the Second Circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs' hot-news misappropriation claim was "preempted by federal copyright law."[24]
Federal Preemption[edit]
The Court recalled that in order to determine whether a state-law claim is preempted by the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 301 sets forth a two part test:

The General Scope Requirement: if the impugned state-law claim "seeks to vindicate 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent' to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17 U.S.C. § 106";

and

The Subject Matter Requirement: "if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. § 102 and 17 U.S.C. § 103."

The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the "subject matter" requirement as well as the "general scope" requirement of the Copyright Act.[24] They held that the hot-news misappropriation exemption from pre-emption carved out in the NBA case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope.[25] In addition, they characterized the 5-part test that was set out in NBA and applied by the District Court as obiter dictum.[26]
Judge Raggi, in a separate concurring opinion, disagreed with the majority that the NBA test was dictum, and would have held that although pre-emption occurred; the 5-part test was valid, but had been misapplied in the Court below.[27]
Organizations Concerned about the Second Circuit's Ruling[edit]
The case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Media Law Project, and Public Citizen, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Second Circuit court to take into consideration the First Amendment as it related to the district court judgement's potential restraints on Americans' abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day.
Google and Twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hot-news misappropriation tort. The Second Circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the court's power and not relevant to the case.
The Newspaper Association of America, The New York Times Company, Philadelphia Media Holdings, Stephens Media, Time, and the Washington Post filed an amicus brief.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Dow Jones & Company, and The Investorside Research Association each filed amicus briefs.
Second Circuit's Humorous Footnotes[edit]
Irony[edit]
In recounting the story of the case, the Second Circuit Court wrote that they "find little to take issue with in the district court's careful findings of facts, to which we must in any event defer. We therefore borrow freely from them." These sentences are followed by a footnote which reads, "The irony of doing so in the context of a copyright-infringement and 'hot news'-misappropriation case is not lost on us."" (Footnote 3).

This claim is then footnoted by the Second Circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the Bible: "In the Bible, that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise. See, e.g., Galatians 6:7: "God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." But cf. Leviticus 23:22, setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown."

Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011), was a case decided in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where the Second Circuit, reversing the decision[1] of the US District Court below it, found that the claims of three major financial investment firms (Barclays Investment Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) against an internet subscription stock news service (theflyonthewall.com) for "Hot-news" Misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand, as they were pre-empted by several sections of the Federal Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106, 17 U.S.C. § 102, and 17 U.S.C. § 103).[2]
The case was significant because the Second Circuit redefined elements of the "Hot-news" Misappropriation tort, breaking with earlier Second Circuit precedent by holding that such precedent was not binding, but merely obiter dicta.[2] According to some legal commentators, the decision would have the effect of making it more difficult for future plaintiffs to bring claims under the hot-news misappropriation doctrine, at least in the Second Circuit.[3]

Story of the Case[edit]
The defendant, Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., was a company that was in the business of obtaining, by various means, daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs, Lehman Brothers (later purchased by Barclays Investment Bank), Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, in their highly sought-after research reports. The defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public. The plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports' exclusivity, accuracy, and timely release (they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open) and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients, to entice clients to execute stock trades through them, and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients.[4]
On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Theflyonthewall.com ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them.[5] The plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims: 1) claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and; 2) claims that the defendant had committed the common-law tort of "hot-news" misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports.[6]
In the procedural lead-up to the trial, the defendants essentially conceded their liability under the copyright claim. Thus, at a bench trial before the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the remaining issues to be tried were the appropriate relief for the copyright claim, as well as liability and relief for the hot-news misappropriation claim.[7] On March 18, 2010, the District Court found in favour of the plaintiffs, issuing an injunction ordering the defendants to cease their publication of the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations (see summary of the court's decision below.)
Shortly thereafter,[8] the defendants appealed the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hot-news misappropriation findings. They argued that the District Court had erred in finding that the hot-news misappropriation claim had been established, that the claim (made under state law) was pre-empted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation, and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted, was overbroad, and violated the defendant's free speech rights under the First Amendment.[9]
On June 20, 2011, the Second Circuit released its decision - reversing the decision of the District Court below, and instructing it to dismiss the claim.[10] A summary of the Second Circuit's decision can also be found below.
Opinion of the District Court[edit]
Hot News Misappropriation[edit]
Hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action originated from International News Service v. Associated Press wherein the Supreme Court held that hot news, defined as time-sensitive information, is protectable as "quasi-property."[11] This misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to "protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable, time-sensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law."[12] Significantly, the 'hot' news doctrine is concerned with "the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge." [13][14] Given that the Copyright Act of 1976 deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works, different judges' holdings questioned the tort of hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action. These discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself. Seventy-nine years later, National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. ("NBA"),[15] provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a five-element test for determining hot-news misappropriation.
Test for Determining Hot-News Misappropriation[edit]
In Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., the court used the five-element test set out in NBA, which was cited in the District Court's opinion as follows:
1) A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;
2) The information is time-sensitive;
3) A defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;
4) The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs;
5) The ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.
[16]
District Court Ruling on Firms' Hot-News Misappropriation Claim[edit]
Element 1[edit]
The plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hot-news misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering.[17]
Element 2[edit]
The plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were held to be "clearly time-sensitive" by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs' clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement. Moreover, the time-sensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were time-sensitive.[18]
Element 3[edit]
For the third element concerning free-riding, the court found that the defendant's "core business [was] its free-riding off the sustained, costly efforts by the Firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors." The court defined free-riding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of "information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost."[19] Whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the "Recommendations" it published, and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the Recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs' expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis, the court found that defendant free-rode off of the plaintiffs' work.[20]
Element 4[edit]
The court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide time-sensitive information to clientele, and the defendant's dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for pre-market hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations. In doing so, the plaintiffs' clientele, already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news, were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including access-controlled media, license third-party distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients.[21]
Element 5[edit]
The court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendant's conduct, and others like the defendant, if allowed to continue, would be "likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs' ability to continue to participate in the market." The court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients. As such, if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs, the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic. Thus, the court argued that if the defendant, and others like it, were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs, they would lose their commission revenue, and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research, and discontinue their research production.
District Court Ruling on Firms' Copyright Claim and Resulting Remedy[edit]
The court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts."[22] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the statutory damage awards, and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" generated by those two plaintiffs.[23]
Opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal[edit]
The defendant appealed the rulings of the District Court on hot-news misappropriation to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On appeal, the Second Circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs' hot-news misappropriation claim was "preempted by federal copyright law."[24]
Federal Preemption[edit]
The Court recalled that in order to determine whether a state-law claim is preempted by the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 301 sets forth a two part test:

The General Scope Requirement: if the impugned state-law claim "seeks to vindicate 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent' to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17 U.S.C. § 106";

and

The Subject Matter Requirement: "if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. § 102 and 17 U.S.C. § 103."

The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the "subject matter" requirement as well as the "general scope" requirement of the Copyright Act.[24] They held that the hot-news misappropriation exemption from pre-emption carved out in the NBA case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope.[25] In addition, they characterized the 5-part test that was set out in NBA and applied by the District Court as obiter dictum.[26]
Judge Raggi, in a separate concurring opinion, disagreed with the majority that the NBA test was dictum, and would have held that although pre-emption occurred; the 5-part test was valid, but had been misapplied in the Court below.[27]
Organizations Concerned about the Second Circuit's Ruling[edit]
The case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Media Law Project, and Public Citizen, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Second Circuit court to take into consideration the First Amendment as it related to the district court judgement's potential restraints on Americans' abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day.
Google and Twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hot-news misappropriation tort. The Second Circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the court's power and not relevant to the case.
The Newspaper Association of America, The New York Times Company, Philadelphia Media Holdings, Stephens Media, Time, and the Washington Post filed an amicus brief.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Dow Jones & Company, and The Investorside Research Association each filed amicus briefs.
Second Circuit's Humorous Footnotes[edit]
Irony[edit]
In recounting the story of the case, the Second Circuit Court wrote that they "find little to take issue with in the district court's careful findings of facts, to which we must in any event defer. We therefore borrow freely from them." These sentences are followed by a footnote which reads, "The irony of doing so in the context of a copyright-infringement and 'hot news'-misappropriation case is not lost on us."" (Footnote 3).
Biblical References[edit]
The Second Circuit court comments on the district court's characterization of the defendant's behavior as having a "biblical" tone," where the district court asserts that the defendant had "reaped where it had not sown." This claim is then footnoted by the Second Circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the Bible: "In the Bible, that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise. See, e.g., Galatians 6:7: "God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." But cf. Leviticus 23:22, setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown."

Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876 (2d Cir. 2011), was a case decided in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where the Second Circuit, reversing the decision[1] of the US District Court below it, found that the claims of three major financial investment firms (Barclays Investment Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) against an internet subscription stock news service (theflyonthewall.com) for "Hot-news" Misappropriation under state common law doctrine could not stand, as they were pre-empted by several sections of the Federal Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 106, 17 U.S.C. § 102, and 17 U.S.C. § 103).[2]

Story of the Case[edit]
The defendant, Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., was a company that was in the business of obtaining, by various means, daily stock recommendations prepared by the plaintiffs, Lehman Brothers (later purchased by Barclays Investment Bank), Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, in their highly sought-after research reports. The defendant sold a service wherein subscribers could receive these recommendations prior to their release by the plaintiffs to the general public. The plaintiffs claimed that the value of the reports to their own clients was predicated on the reports' exclusivity, accuracy, and timely release (they were often only valuable during the few hours before the stock market would open) and whose value to the firms in turn was predicated on their potential to attract and retain clients, to entice clients to execute stock trades through them, and to differentiate themselves from other financial services firms and for generating revenue by way of commissions earned from facilitating trades on behalf of those clients.[4]
On June 26, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Theflyonthewall.com ordering them to cease distributing portions of the exclusive research reports as well as the recommendations within them.[5] The plaintiffs sought to base their request for injunctive relief on two sets of legal claims: 1) claims that the defendant had violated their copyright in the research reports by verbatim copying and dissemination of portions of the reports and; 2) claims that the defendant had committed the common-law tort of "hot-news" misappropriation by publishing the recommendations within the reports.[6]

Shortly thereafter,[8] the defendants appealed the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The defendants abandoned their defence against the copyright claims and focused solely on the hot-news misappropriation findings. They argued that the District Court had erred in finding that the hot-news misappropriation claim had been established, that the claim (made under state law) was pre-empted and therefore barred by federal copyright legislation, and that the resulting injunction was improperly granted, was overbroad, and violated the defendant's free speech rights under the First Amendment.[9]
On June 20, 2011, the Second Circuit released its decision - reversing the decision of the District Court below, and instructing it to dismiss the claim.[10] A summary of the Second Circuit's decision can also be found below.
Opinion of the District Court[edit]
Hot News Misappropriation[edit]
Hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action originated from International News Service v. Associated Press wherein the Supreme Court held that hot news, defined as time-sensitive information, is protectable as "quasi-property."[11] This misappropriation doctrine was developed further with the aim to "protect costly efforts to gather commercially valuable, time-sensitive information that would otherwise be unprotected by law."[12] Significantly, the 'hot' news doctrine is concerned with "the copying and publication of information gathered by another before he has been able to utilize his competitive edge." [13][14] Given that the Copyright Act of 1976 deals specifically with copyright misappropriation for original works, different judges' holdings questioned the tort of hot-news misappropriation as a cause of action. These discussions included copyright protection as only belonging to the realm of originality and not effort as well as holdings that the creative organization of information was copyrightable but not the information itself. Seventy-nine years later, National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc. ("NBA"),[15] provided answers to the questions that preceded it and also provided a five-element test for determining hot-news misappropriation.
Test for Determining Hot-News Misappropriation[edit]
In Barclays Capital Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., the court used the five-element test set out in NBA, which was cited in the District Court's opinion as follows:
1) A plaintiff generates or gathers information at a cost;
2) The information is time-sensitive;
3) A defendant's use of the information constitutes free riding on the plaintiff's efforts;
4) The defendant is in direct competition with a product or service offered by the plaintiffs;
5) The ability of other parties to free-ride on the efforts of the plaintiff or others would so reduce the incentive to produce the product or service that its existence or quality would be substantially threatened.
[16]
District Court Ruling on Firms' Hot-News Misappropriation Claim[edit]
Element 1[edit]
The plaintiffs satisfied the first element of the hot-news misappropriation test because the plaintiffs spent "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs engaged in costly information gathering.[17]
Element 2[edit]
The plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were held to be "clearly time-sensitive" by virtue of the fact that the plaintiffs' clients used the information for their actions in anticipation of stock price movement. Moreover, the time-sensitivity was especially important as the plaintiffs expended resources to be the first to communicate these findings to the client and generate commissions revenue. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiffs' reports and recommendations were time-sensitive.[18]
Element 3[edit]
For the third element concerning free-riding, the court found that the defendant's "core business [was] its free-riding off the sustained, costly efforts by the Firms and other investment institutions to generate equity research that is highly valued by investors." The court defined free-riding as where there is very little investment by the defendant to profit off of "information generated or collected by the plaintiff at great cost."[19] Whereas the defendant did not on its own generate original research for the "Recommendations" it published, and its ability to profit off of the reproductions of the Recommendations relied on both the plaintiffs reputations as well as the plaintiffs' expenditure of resources toward generating expert analysis, the court found that defendant free-rode off of the plaintiffs' work.[20]
Element 4[edit]
The court found that the parties were in direct competition in that both were attempting to provide time-sensitive information to clientele, and the defendant's dissemination of that information prior to the plaintiffs being able to satisfy the demand for pre-market hours stock movement reports and trade recommendations. In doing so, the plaintiffs' clientele, already identified as more likely to trade through the source from which they ascertained the news, were less likely to do their trading through the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court noted that the defendant and the plaintiffs both used similar channels of information distribution including access-controlled media, license third-party distributors to disseminate their information to entitled recipients.[21]
Element 5[edit]
The court found that this element required the demonstration that the defendant's conduct, and others like the defendant, if allowed to continue, would be "likely substantially to threaten plaintiffs' ability to continue to participate in the market." The court noted that the plaintiffs relied on being the first to report their reports and recommendations to their clients. As such, if other organizations were to preempt the plaintiffs, the knowledge that the plaintiffs had spent money to gather and analyze would be rendered basic. Thus, the court argued that if the defendant, and others like it, were allowed to continue copying and disseminating the research reports of the plaintiffs, they would lose their commission revenue, and not be able to offset the cost of producing the research, and discontinue their research production.
District Court Ruling on Firms' Copyright Claim and Resulting Remedy[edit]
The court found that the defendant had infringed the copyrights of two of the plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts."[22] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the statutory damage awards, and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" generated by those two plaintiffs.[23]
Opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal[edit]
The defendant appealed the rulings of the District Court on hot-news misappropriation to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On appeal, the Second Circuit court reversed the decision below and ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiffs' hot-news misappropriation claim was "preempted by federal copyright law."[24]
Federal Preemption[edit]
The Court recalled that in order to determine whether a state-law claim is preempted by the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 301 sets forth a two part test:

The General Scope Requirement: if the impugned state-law claim "seeks to vindicate 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent' to one of the bundle of exclusive rights already protected by copyright law under 17 U.S.C. § 106";

and

The Subject Matter Requirement: "if the work in question is of the type of works protected by the Copyright Act under 17 U.S.C. § 102 and 17 U.S.C. § 103."

The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs recommendations satisfied the "subject matter" requirement as well as the "general scope" requirement of the Copyright Act.[24] They held that the hot-news misappropriation exemption from pre-emption carved out in the NBA case was explicitly intended to be narrow in scope.[25] In addition, they characterized the 5-part test that was set out in NBA and applied by the District Court as obiter dictum.[26]
Judge Raggi, in a separate concurring opinion, disagreed with the majority that the NBA test was dictum, and would have held that although pre-emption occurred; the 5-part test was valid, but had been misapplied in the Court below.[27]
Organizations Concerned about the Second Circuit's Ruling[edit]
The case was followed widely and several prominent organizations filed amicus curiae briefs as intervenors.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Media Law Project, and Public Citizen, Inc. filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Second Circuit court to take into consideration the First Amendment as it related to the district court judgement's potential restraints on Americans' abilities to gather and comment on the news of the day.
Google and Twitter filed an amicus brief calling for the repudiation of the hot-news misappropriation tort. The Second Circuit held that this was beyond the bounds of the court's power and not relevant to the case.
The Newspaper Association of America, The New York Times Company, Philadelphia Media Holdings, Stephens Media, Time, and the Washington Post filed an amicus brief.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Dow Jones & Company, and The Investorside Research Association each filed amicus briefs.
Second Circuit's Humorous Footnotes[edit]
Irony[edit]
In recounting the story of the case, the Second Circuit Court wrote that they "find little to take issue with in the district court's careful findings of facts, to which we must in any event defer. We therefore borrow freely from them." These sentences are followed by a footnote which reads, "The irony of doing so in the context of a copyright-infringement and 'hot news'-misappropriation case is not lost on us."" (Footnote 3).
Biblical References[edit]
The Second Circuit court comments on the district court's characterization of the defendant's behavior as having a "biblical" tone," where the district court asserts that the defendant had "reaped where it had not sown." This claim is then footnoted by the Second Circuit to include an analysis of this phrase as it appears in the Bible: "In the Bible, that turn of phrase seems to be more a threat than a promise. See, e.g., Galatians 6:7: "God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap." But cf. Leviticus 23:22, setting forth circumstances under which persons are forbidden to reap where they have sown."
