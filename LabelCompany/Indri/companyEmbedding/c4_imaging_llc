Prostate Brachytherapy



Brachytherapy is a Clinical Standard for Prostate Cancer Treatment

Brachytherapy, or radioactive seed implantation, is a standard option for the curative treatment of prostate cancer. Brachytherapy involves implanting around 100 radioactive seeds directly into the prostate. Its popularity has increased due to its effectiveness, convenience, relatively low incidence of erectile dysfunction, and minimal invasiveness. 1 Radiation released from the seeds penetrates the surrounding prostate tissue at a distance of ~15 mm, with most of the radiation concentrated within the prostate. Outcomes after brachytherapy can be excellent but depend greatly on the quality of the implant: 8-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival rates of 93% for high-quality implants vs. 76% for low-quality ones have been reported. 2


MRI is the Ideal Imaging Option for Assessing Prostate Anatomy and Seed Placement

The inability of standard imaging options (ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], fluoroscopy) to clearly visualize soft tissue complicates accurate assessment of the radiation dose delivered by implanted seeds.  Prostate edge detection is very poor on CT images, which can result in a high degree of inter-observer variability in prostate contouring and hence in implant quality evaluation. A study estimating prostate gland volumes and subsequent quantifiers of implant adequacy highlighted the significant inter-observer differences when using post-implant CT scans. These variations led to significant differences in Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) according to the individual reviewers. 3



The efficacy of MRI for evaluating soft tissues after seed implantation has been well described. 4 The internal and external urinary sphincters in particular cannot be adequately identified with CT imaging, but they are well visualized with MRI. However, the use of MRI in prostate brachytherapy has been limited by the inability to accurately identify the seeds. All implanted seeds have the radioactive element encased within a paramagnetic titanium shell, which appears under MRI as a signal void that cannot be easily distinguished from needle tracks or blood vessels. Moreover, seeds in vascularized regions or periprostatic tissue can also be difficult to identify. In brachytherapy, where mm-level precision is necessary to limit excessive radiation dose (“hotspots”) within normal tissue and to prevent poor radiation coverage (“cold spots”) of the prostate 5, it is unlikely that adequate seed separation can be achieved with MRI detection of seeds alone.
The development of a positive-signal MRI marker to aid in seed detection and localization could be an advance for prostate brachytherapy, with the potential to improve the quality of implants. Clinicians could have more confidence in the quality of treatment delivered, and supplemental seeds could be implanted immediately if needed. In addition, effective management strategies could be immediately employed if regions are known to have inadvertently receive an excess dose. The superior image quality of MRI could improve the accuracy of prostate contouring, allow detailed appreciation of adjacent critical organs and reveal the true relationship of the implanted seeds to the prostate and critical dose-limiting structures.

Novel MRI Technology
C4 Imaging's goal is to allow post-implant seed localization to be performed with MRI alone, eliminating the use of computed tomography in assessment of prostate brachytherapy.




Sirius™ the First Positive-Signal MRI Marker

T1W 
T2W 

The Sirius™ MRI Marker has been demonstrated to be visible with T1W and T2W signals, and can positively identify the location of implanted radioactive seeds. 
The superior image quality of MRI could improve the accuracy of prostate contouring.
If seeds could be readily localized with MRI,
			it could reveal the true relationship of radiation
			dose to the prostate and critical dose-limiting
			structures.


No impact on treatment planning and delivery— Sirius™ simply replaces seed spacers

C4 Imaging has developed a novel positive-signal MRI Marker for seed localization, which could allow physicians  to effectively incorporate MRI into post-treatment assessment.

The Sirius™ MRI Marker consists of a sealed biocompatible, polymer capsule containing C4, a unique MRI agent. The length of each capsule is 5.5 mm and the diameter is 0.8 mm. The Sirius™ MRI Marker is intended to be implanted as a brachytherapy seed spacer that will facilitate the anatomical post-implant localization of seeds. 

Anisotropy measurements taken when attached to Iodine 125 seeds were equivalent to the standard TG43U parameters. 6 A Monte Carlo study was performed to assess the impact on a simulated prostate implant. The Sirius™ MRI Markers does not alter radiation treatment delivery when compared with a standard seed spacer. 7

December 6, 2013

	C4 Imaging LLC is pleased to announce U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance of its first product, the Sirius™ MRI Marker. The novel Positive-Signal MRI Marker will be used following treatment of prostate cancer with brachytherapy to facilitate seed localization within the prostate, utilizing a single post-implant Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging procedure.

Brachytherapy, or radioactive seed implantation, is a standard option for the curative treatment of prostate cancer. Brachytherapy involves implanting around 100 radioactive seeds into the prostate. Its popularity has increased due to its effectiveness, convenience, relatively low incidence of erectile dysfunction, and minimal invasiveness. Radiation released from the seeds penetrates the surrounding prostate tissue at a limited distance, with most of the radiation concentrated within the prostate. Outcomes after brachytherapy can be excellent but depend greatly on the quality of the implant: 8-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival rates of 93% for high-quality implants vs. 76% for low-quality ones have been reported.

	"A Positive-Signal MRI marker can enhance seed detection, this represents a significant advancement for prostate brachytherapy," said Steven J. Frank MD, Founder and Chairman of C4 Imaging. "If seeds can be readily localized with MRI, it would lead to more effective treatment and better patient outcomes."

	"510(k) clearance for Sirius™ is a major milestone for us," said Andrew Bright, President and CEO of C4 Imaging. "The encapsulation of a contrast agent within a permanently implantable device allows positive MRI seed localization after brachytherapy to be offered to more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the U.S. each year."  He added, "With our 510(k) now cleared, we're actively pursuing options for supplying Sirius™ to physicians treating prostate cancer in the U.S., as well as seeking regulatory clearance in Canada and Europe."

Genetic test to predict IBD severity in children
Dr. Christine Olbjørn
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with abdominal pain and diarrhea being the most common symptoms. It can be challenging to diagnose as gastrointestinal complaints mimicking IBD are common.







Diagnosing prostate cancer through a £225 urine test
Jan Groen, Ph.D.
This test, which we have branded SelectMDx for Prostate Cancer, came with the acquisition of a company in the Netherlands called NovioGendix. They developed a prototype assay, so they did most of the heavy lifting in terms of discovering the two specific biomarkers that are currently in the product. These biomarkers are tuned towards the detection of what I call clinically significant prostate cancer.

 C4 Imaging Announces FDA 510(k) Clearance of Sirius Positive-Signal MRI Marker 
   


 




December 11, 2013 — C4 Imaging LLC announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance of its first product, the Sirius MRI Marker. The positive-signal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker will be used following treatment of prostate cancer with brachytherapy to facilitate seed localization within the prostate, utilizing a single post-implant MRI procedure.
 
Brachytherapy, or radioactive seed implantation, is a standard option for the curative treatment of prostate cancer. Brachytherapy involves implanting around 100 radioactive seeds into the prostate. Its popularity has increased due to its effectiveness, convenience, relatively low incidence of erectile dysfunction and minimal invasiveness [1]. Radiation released from the seeds penetrates the surrounding prostate tissue at a limited distance, with most of the radiation concentrated within the prostate. Outcomes after brachytherapy depend greatly on the quality of the implant: eight-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival rates of 93 percent for high-quality implants versus 76 percent for low-quality implants have been reported [2].
 
"A Positive-Signal MRI marker can enhance seed detection. This represents a significant advancement for prostate brachytherapy," said Steven Frank M.D., founder and chairman, C4 Imaging. "If seeds can be readily localized with MRI, it would lead to more effective treatment and better patient outcomes."
 
"The encapsulation of a contrast agent within a permanently implantable device allows positive MRI seed localization after brachytherapy to be offered to more than 200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the U.S. each year [3]," said Andrew Bright, president and CEO, C4 Imaging.
 
"With our 510(k) now cleared, we're actively pursuing options for supplying Sirius to physicians treating prostate cancer in the U.S., as well as seeking regulatory clearance in Canada and Europe,” Bright added.

  [01/04/2014]  AnazaoHealth Corporation Signs SIRIUS™ MRI MARKER Loading Services Agreement with C4 Imaging AnazaoHealth Corporation Signs SIRIUS™ MRI MARKER Loading Services Agreement with C4 Imaging
 
Tampa, FL, (April 1, 2014) – AnazaoHealth Corporation is pleased to announce the signing of a Patient Specific Brachytherapy Seed Loading Services Agreement with C4 Imaging LLC. This agreement includes C4 Imaging’s first product, the Sirius™ MRI Marker. This novel positive-signal, MRI Marker [1] will be used following treatment of prostate cancer with brachytherapy to facilitate seed localization within the prostate, utilizing a single post-implant Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging procedure. Under the agreement AnazaoHealth will load the Sirius™ MRI Marker alongside seeds into brachytherapy strands and needles according a physician prescription tailored to each individual patient. 
 
“AnazaoHealth has a long-standing reputation for quality and service to the prescription-loaded prostate brachytherapy market,” said Andrew Bright, President and CEO of C4 Imaging. “We are delighted to partner with them, allowing broad access to our Sirius™ MRI Marker for prostate brachytherapy physicians and seed vendors alike.” 
 
Brachytherapy, or radioactive seed implantation, is a standard option for the curative treatment of prostate cancer. Brachytherapy involves implanting around 100 seeds into the prostate. Its popularity has increased due to its effectiveness, convenience, relatively low incidence of erectile dysfunction, and minimal invasiveness [2]. Radiation released from the seeds penetrates the surrounding prostate tissue at a limited distance, with most of the radiation concentrated within the prostate. Outcomes after brachytherapy can be excellent but depend greatly on the quality of the implant: 8-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free survival rates of 93% for high-quality implants vs. 76% for low-quality ones have been reported [3].
 
“While C4 Imaging is a new entrant into the US prostate brachytherapy market the company’s management team is highly experienced in this area”, said Chris A. Arnette, President and Chief Operating Officer of AnazaoHealth Corporation. “We are excited to partner with them as they introduce the Sirius™ MRI Marker. Sirius™ has the potential to revolutionize prostate brachytherapy; with improved MRI based post-implant imaging leading to further increases in the quality of this highly-effective, cost-effective treatment option.”

Bellaire-based C4 Imaging LLC has raised $1.1 million that gives the medical device company extra cash as it pushes its MRI technology into commercialization.
C4 Imaging, based out of technology from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, allows MRI technology to be used more effectively in the management of prostate cancer, said CEO Andrew Bright. To date, C4 has raised $4.65 million since 2010. The latest round included investments from 51 different investors, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"The latest round was revisiting most of the original investors, all of whom have been pleased with the progress," Bright said. "There were also a few other, more strategic and sophisticated investors prepared to come in further along and with more money."





One of C4's products, Sirius MRI Marker, recently went through the Food and Drug Administration and is in the early stages of going to market, Bright said. Long-term, C4 hopes to find a partner to help flush out the company's sales and marketing operations.That could also include, potentially, a merger or acquisition.
"The goal isn't set in stone, but it is to look for a partnership with someone to add value to core technology as we have opposed to building C4 out into a major sales and marketing organization," Bright said.
