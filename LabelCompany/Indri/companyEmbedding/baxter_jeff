Anesthesia & Critical Care

Baxter is a leading manufacturer of products for general anesthesia. These include anesthetic gases, or inhaled anesthetics, and anesthesia-related critical care drugs. 
View Products


BioSurgery

Baxter's BioSurgery business unit offers a comprehensive line of biologics, devices and combination products.
View Products


Drug Delivery

Baxter is one of the world's leading manufacturers of commercially prepared IV solutions in flexible containers. Baxter also has a range of irrigation solutions and sets to suit a wide range of patient needs.
View Products


Infusion Systems

Large Volume Pumps (LVP) are used to deliver medication and solutions through various routes (e.g. Intravenous and epidural) for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. They are designed for more accurate fluid delivery than manually adjusted gravity infusions. 
View Products


Access

Baxter's comprehensive Access portfolio includes Pump Administration sets, Gravity Sets, and ONE-LINK Neutral Displacement Needleless Connector.  Baxter’s Access portfolio offers a variety of different components and configurations to meet a broad range of clinical applications.

Enteral & Oral Syringes


View Products


IV Preparation & Compounding

It takes spikes, syringes, and pumps to make an intravenous (IV) solution. A pharmacy workflow management system and automated compounding system can help streamline pharmacy operations. Though vastly different, these tools share a basic truth. Behind every IV dose there is a pharmacist and behind every pharmacist there is the means to not only make that dose, but also support pharmacy workflow. 
View Products


Parenteral Nutrition Solutions & Additives

One size does not fit all for nutrition therapy. Prescribing practices are as unique as patient populations, and pharmacies have varying levels of nutrition compounding capability and expertise.  Baxter's leading Parenteral Nutrition Portfolio offers pharmacy technology, premixes and a comprehensive selection of macro and micronutrients to support specific requirements.

“Now That You’ve Gotten Access To The *Exact High Ticket Blueprint, Learn How To Get Tons Of Eyeballs Seeing Your Offers..”
 
“Do You Want To Know The #1 Problem That Most Entrepreneurs Face Which Keeps Them Broke?”






From: The Desktop Of Jeff Baxter
Location: A place that Mr. Trump despises (Mexico hehe)
I recently surveyed a group of marketers on my list and do you want to know what the #1 problem that they seem to face in their business?
Generating traffic!
There’s no doubt that as an entrepreneur you need targeted eyeballs seeing what you offer or else you’re not going to make money or enough of it..
Whether you’re a beginner and have not found your way online yet OR maybe you’re an intermediate to advanced marketer with your own products or affiliate associations, I’m about to solve 90% of your entrepreneurial problems by teaching you what I know for getting upwards of 50,000 targeted visitors per month to my sites..






“Who Am I and How My Business Changed When I Mastered Traffic Generation”
I got my start in this whole Internet Marketing journey back in about 2008..
Just like many others starting out, I knew that making money online was possible but I just couldn’t seem to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together and make it work..
There was a point where it seemed as if everything I did FAILED and did so miserably..I was frustrated and Ready to give up, but then it hit me!
I was making this whole online thing more complicated than it had to be as I just needed to make sure I remembered this simple formula that my mentors repetitively mentioned..
Traffic+ Offer= Sales!
I had the offers, whether it was my own or some mlm company I was hooked up with, but what kept me from succeeding was TRAFFIC.
To make a long story short, I made a promise to myself to learn as much as I possibly could about traffic generation so that I would never have this”shortage of money” problem again..
knew that I had top notch offers, but just needed more people seeing them and I could make bank..
Once this piece of the puzzle was finally figured out that’s when my business took off! Just look at how much traffic I’m bringing in these days..








That’s not even a fraction of the various traffic stats I can show you, but the point I’m trying to make is that I do this in real life!
No theory, no funny business..
What’s even more cool about being able to send tons of people to my sites now are the SALES! More sales equals more money in the bank to live what most of us call the “Internet Marketing Lifestyle”..
Here’s just a glimpse into my life thanks to cracking the “traffic generation” code..






I’m pretty much able to do what I and WHEN I want now as my business runs on autopilot. Of course this would not be possible without having red hot targeted visitors landing on my pages every single day ready to buy..
Mastering this single aspect is when things changed..
Bringing offers back to life that were buried among thousands of other webpages is when my business took a turn for the better..
How would you like to watch right over my shoulders as I show you insane traffic generation methods that are so powerful it could result in merchant accounts being closed because of sudden increased sales volume?
Imagine being a complete novice when it comes to traffic generation today and by this time next month you’re bringing in hundreds if not thousands of visitors DAILY to your website or offers resulting in more money in the bank..
What I’ve put together is a comprehensive video training series that walks you through some of my most PROFITABLE traffic methods that allow me to pull in upwards of 50,000 targeted visitors per month and run multiple 6 figure yearly businesses.
Here’s everything you’re about to get access to..






Module 1: Mastering Joint Venture Traffic Generation and The $40,000 Affiliate Mailout..
..the best way to leverage your business is by using other people’s traffic . In this module I’m going to teach you everything you need to know about getting affiliates to promote for you

Key Benefits Of Module 1











Benefit #1:Learn My “standout” Methods.


If you’re a product creator then you know that getting affiliates to promote your stuff can oftentimes be a challenge. When there’s hundreds of other individuals doing the same thing it’s important to learn how to effectively standout or else you’re just another vendor looking to get people who don’t know you promoting your offer.
I’ll be showing you strategies and the psychology behind getting tons of affiliates sending traffic to your site causing sales to pour in like clockwork!
















Benefit #2:Learn CPA Traffic Generation.


Ever wanted to know what it’s like to have your own product on a cpa network where you haveTHOUSANDS of people seeing your offer daily? Sounds expensive right?
It can be, but I’ll be showing you secret funnel strategies that allow you to start on a small budget and create a quick return on investment while your affiliates keep a nice epc. Everybody wins and you don’t lose your shirt..
















Benefit #3:The $40,000 Affiliate Mailout.


It’s one thing having a bunch of small affiliates promoting your offer, but it’s a different story when you have SUPER Affiliates. I’ll be showing you how I managed to bring in one affiliate who brought in over $40,000 in sales to my offer in under 30 days and even more throughout the course of the launch.






Module 2: Bing Ads PPC and How To Get Cheap Clicks Even In The Most Competitive Niches
Whether you’ve been doing bing ppc already or “heard” about how great it is, I’ll be showing you some ninja strategies that allow me to bring in sales like clockwork with this search engine..

Key Benefits Of Module 2











Benefit #1: Proper Keyword Research and Adsets.


One thing we’ll discuss is how to effectively do keyword research and how not to over-complicate this process. Also, when it comes to adsets per campaign, you’ll be surprised at how many keywords I use which is totally opposite than what most “experts” recommend. I’ll be showing you why and the reason I have positive results doing it this way.
















Benefit #2: Proper Campaign Structure.


The main problem that many individuals face when it comes to doing ppc is getting overwhelmed because of various settings. I’ll be showing you the exact settings I use which results in a positive return on investment every single time.
















Benefit #3: Effective Ad Copywriting.


You can have the best keywords and proper settings, but if your ads are not written to get people clicking, then everything you have done would be in vain. I’ll be showing you how to have massive amounts of people clicking through to your offer and ready to buy!
















Benefit #4: Landing Page Secrets.


Should I send visitors to a blog post? Should I send visitors to a squeeze page? How do I increase my quality score? How do I get people BUYING when they land on my page? All of those questions and more will be answered






Module 3: How To Get FREE Targeted Traffic For MLM, Affiliate Or Even Your Own Offers
Discover my free traffic generation strategies that you can use to sell practically anything without spending a penny! 

Key Benefits Of Module 3











Benefit #1: Get On An Even Playing Field.


As you probably already know, when it comes to promoting some type of offers, according to the industry, it can be extremely difficult to do paid ads without getting your account closed.
With my free traffic generation strategies, you’ll learn how to be on an even playing field with people in other industries who are able to use paid ads BUT without you having to spend a dime.
















Benefit #2: Nonchalant Pitch Method.


Part of this training is going to teach you how to utilize a method that gets cold prospects BUYING what you offer without coming off as “spammy”.
There’s nothing worse than coming off as lame and destroying relationships so I show you a method that I use personally for getting no less than 600 targeted people seeing my offers monthly on a specific network without paying anything.
Oh and these people have MONEY to spend so don’t let that 3 digit number fool you..
















Benefit #3: Being Broke Is No Problem.


You can have the best keywords and proper settings, but if your ads are not written to get people clicking, then everything you have done would be in vain. I’ll be showing you how to have massive amounts of people clicking through to your offer and ready to buy!

Cock-A-Doodle Doo- Ex Egg Picker Turns Into Self Made 6 Figure Internet Entrepreneur
 
Ding dong..
The doorbell rang for the final time as I was in the shower and tried my best to hurry and answer as I had a VERY special package waiting to be delivered that day.
By the time I opened the door, I seen the fedex truck drive off and fortunately a receipt was left stating to pick up my package at the local post office. Filled with excitement, I quickly grabbed the keys to my 1998 Toyota Corolla and headed out.
“What can we do for you?” said the middle aged Caucasian man that was working in what seemed like one of the most gloomy post offices that I walked into in my entire 15 years of being on earth. I’m not sure if it was the poor lighting or the atrocious smell that gave me a weird feeling, but let’s just say it wasn’t the best environment for my precious package to be in.
“Yes, I just missed a delivery for Jeff Baxter and here’s the receipt” was my response to him. He went to the back and as he brought my package upfront,  I heard something that was like music to my ears..
“chirp..chirp..chirp” was the sound that came from the box that was handed to me which seemed like it weighed only a pound. Inside, there was 50 freshly born baby chickens that I ordered from a catalog that was given to me by a neighbor. I was always fascinated with animals and decided that I would give “raising chickens” a go for the first time.
Looks Like We Have A Guest..
Within my batch of new chickens there was about 5 roosters (males) to the 45 hens (females). I can remember like it was yesterday, being nearly 100 degrees outside, I went to go check up on the crew which was about 7 months old now and graduated from being inside a small room in the house to having their very own habitation outside. As I went to make sure that they had water,  I seen something out of the corner of my eye inside one of the chicken coops and turned out it was a SNAKE!
I immediately went to go and grab my .410 shotgun and by the time I returned he was gone!
I set out on a hunt.
I began to turn over every single board that was around the chicken pen and still no sign of him.
I circled around to the back of the pen where there was some 2×4’s which he could have slid under.
For some strange reason I felt like this was where he was hiding, so I made sure to be extremely careful and began to toss each board one by one.
As I got to the last board, I made sure my gun was ready and quickly moved it. BOOM! There he was, about 6 feet worth of snake curled up allowing me to get a perfect shot off.
After I made the kill, I noticed that the snake had a HUUGE lump towards his mid-section once I stretched him out. It looked like he swallowed a ball, but of course being green when it came to dealing with chickens I had no clue what I was about to witness.
I decided to cut this particular section open on the snake and lo and behold there was a perfectly rounded brown egg inside!
As far as I was concerned, it had not been cracked or contaminated so I washed it off to eat later on.
I mean c’mon ! No need to waste food even if it’s been inside the belly of a snake!
This Is How It All Started
Although I had just faced a pretty intense situation, I was super excited to know that my chickens started to lay eggs!
Primarily, it wasn’t even about trying to sell the eggs.
I just enjoyed eating something organic for the first time in my life.
I enjoyed going out to the chicken pen everyday to see how many eggs I could get. Oh and for my little “visitors” who liked to borrow what was mine, I decided to plant some golf balls around the chicken pen and let’s just say I never had a problem since.
With nearly 45 hens, I was getting a TON of eggs every single day and it was just way too much for myself and my family to consume so I decided to sell.
I did my research online and found out that I could sell organic eggs for up to $5 per dozen so that’s what I did.
People bought.
They didn’t care about the price.
They liked the taste of organic eggs that came from the hot gluteus maximus of a chicken that freely roamed and ate grasshoppers.
I sold out every single week and even started to buy eggs from another person who had free range chickens as well then turned around and sold for a higher price to keep up with demand.
I was a hustler.
I ordered more and more chickens until we couldn’t house anymore and it was at this time that the “entrepreneurial bug” was installed.
I enjoyed making people happy with my products.
I enjoyed making money with an honest gig that actually made people more healthy.
I Lost Interest In The Chicken Business But The Entrepreneurship Remained.
As I got older, I was no longer interested in selling eggs so my flock grew smaller and smaller as it was extremely difficult to keep chickens with coyotes around and of course with the extreme weather conditions in the summer.
I no longer replenished the flock with new chickens so eventually all had died out as years went on.
I was still an entrepreneur inside as I did everything from learning the skill of “cutting hair” and becoming one of the top barbers in my school to doing other gigs that resulted in me creating my own economy.
Long story short, as time went on, I stumbled upon “internet marketing” and seen how guys my age were making in a month what most people didn’t even make in a YEAR selling digital products.
It really intrigued me but at the same time I was always “skeptical” about the whole internet thing and could only think SCAM.
Fortunately, I came across individuals who I felt like I could trust and learned as much as I possibly could from them.
I began to create my own digital products around different subjects and sometimes they did well, sometimes they didnt!
As time went on I became better..
I learned more..
I had different subjects I could make products about,became better at selling and eventually went on to become a full-time internet entrepreneur.
Here’s What I Do Now and How I Can Help You
Today I help two types of individuals.
1.) Those who already have established businesses but are horrible at generating traffic, leads and sales from the internet.
2.) Those who want to learn the ropes to building their own digital based business from scratch.
My expertise includes copywriting, traffic generation ,lead generation and product creation.
I love what I do and it all started from a chicken catalog that was handed to me back when I was about 15 years old.
Today I’ve had the privilege to create multiple 6 figure online businesses and help a ton of individuals take their life and business to the next level.

Jeffrey Allen "Skunk" Baxter (born December 13, 1948) is an American guitarist, known for his stints in the rock bands Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers during the 1970s and Spirit in the 1980s. More recently, he has been working as a defense consultant and chairs a Congressional Advisory Board on missile defense.[1]

Early career[edit]
He was born in Washington, D.C.
While working at Manny's Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. For a short period during that year, Baxter was the bassist in a Hendrix-led band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, along with fellow Manny's employee Randy California. Baxter also worked as a guitar tech and amplifier repairman at Jack's Drum Shop on Boylston Street in Boston.
Baxter graduated from the Taft School[2] in Watertown, Connecticut and enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University[3] in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands.
Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.[4] Baxter joined the band for their third and final album, titled III.[5] After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart.[6][7]
With Steely Dan[edit]
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist. In 1972 he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer (and session player Elliott Randall on various tracks).
Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, Can't Buy a Thrill in 1972, Countdown to Ecstasy in 1973, and Pretzel Logic in 1974.[5]
With the Doobie Brothers[edit]
While finishing work on Pretzel Logic, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen's intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring, and to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on Vices as well as "South City Midnight Lady" on its predecessor, The Captain and Me. Baxter's first album as a full member of the group was 1975's Stampede. Baxter contributed an acoustic interlude entitled "Precis," significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar, and the guitar solo for the hit single "Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)".
While preparing to tour in support of Stampede, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald's vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter's jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album Takin' It to the Streets, 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line, and particularly 1978's Minute by Minute, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter's work on the album includes a noted performance at the end of "How Do the Fools Survive?".
In early 1979, Baxter and co-founding drummer John Hartman left the band.
Post-Doobie Brothers music career[edit]
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.
In 1982, he featured on Spirit's album Spirit of '84, released as The Thirteenth Dream outside of the USA.[8]
In 1984, Baxter sat in and played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites' Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney ("Tigger"), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ.[9] That same year, Baxter produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band's album Where the Beat Meets the Street on Columbia Records.
In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.[10]
In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and can be heard on the cast album. He was producer on a Bob Welch album in 1982, Eye Contact. In 1994 Baxter performed on the video game Tuneland. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video titled 'Guitar' (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc) where he travels the world and interviews respected guitarists he admires.
He continues accepting studio work; his most recent such work involved tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger's Language of the Heart, and The Beach Boys' That's Why God Made the Radio. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel B. Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration's Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow's band Beats Workin' at the Congressional Picnic held on the South Lawn of the White House.
JBL's Peter Chaikin interviewed CJ Vanston about his collaboration with Jeff Baxter on their forthcoming album, Skunk.[11][12]
Movies and TV[edit]
Baxter worked on King of the Hill (TV series) in 1997 composing songs for 3 episodes. "Peggy the Boggle Champ", "Hank's Unmentionables Problem", and "Square Peg". Also in 1997 he worked on two others as a composer, "The Blues Brothers Animated Series" (TV series), and "The Curse of Inferno" (TV series) . He composed work for " Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" (TV series) "Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat" in 1993. Composed for Pee-wee's Playhouse (TV series) "Tons of Fun" 1987. Beverly Hills, 90210 (TV series) "The Green Room" (1990) Credited soundtracks "Roxanne" 1987 writer and producer for the songs "Party Tonight", "Can This Be Love". "Class of 1984" 1982 "You Better Not Step Out of Line" / performer on "Suburbanite".
Baxter has appeared in a number of documentaries, including "Jan & Dean The Other Beach Boys" (2002), "The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Vol. 7 and 8" (1995), "American Bandstand's 40th Anniversary Special" (1995), TV series "What's Happening!!" Doobie or Not Doobie: Parts 1 and 2 with The Doobie Brothers (1978), "Emerson" (2013), "Turn It Up!" (2013), "Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who" (2007), "Overnight" (2003), "The Doobie Brothers: Let the Music Play" (2012), "The Making of 'Blues Brothers 2000" (1998) and "Guitar" (1991).[13]
Defense consulting career[edit]
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, Baxter's interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use, specifically data-compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices. His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to Aviation Week magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point he wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system. He gave the paper to California Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Backed by several influential Capitol Hill lawmakers, Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.
Baxter's work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He now consults to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, as well as for defense-oriented manufacturers including Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason he became sought after by the government.
"We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,"[14] Baxter has said. "My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at."
Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News Channel advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.
In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Rep. Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.[15]
In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC).

Early career[edit]
He was born in Washington, D.C.
While working at Manny's Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. For a short period during that year, Baxter was the bassist in a Hendrix-led band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, along with fellow Manny's employee Randy California. Baxter also worked as a guitar tech and amplifier repairman at Jack's Drum Shop on Boylston Street in Boston.
Baxter graduated from the Taft School[2] in Watertown, Connecticut and enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University[3] in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands.
Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.[4] Baxter joined the band for their third and final album, titled III.[5] After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart.[6][7]
With Steely Dan[edit]
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist. In 1972 he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer (and session player Elliott Randall on various tracks).
Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, Can't Buy a Thrill in 1972, Countdown to Ecstasy in 1973, and Pretzel Logic in 1974.[5]
With the Doobie Brothers[edit]
While finishing work on Pretzel Logic, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen's intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring, and to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on Vices as well as "South City Midnight Lady" on its predecessor, The Captain and Me. Baxter's first album as a full member of the group was 1975's Stampede. Baxter contributed an acoustic interlude entitled "Precis," significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar, and the guitar solo for the hit single "Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)".
While preparing to tour in support of Stampede, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald's vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter's jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album Takin' It to the Streets, 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line, and particularly 1978's Minute by Minute, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter's work on the album includes a noted performance at the end of "How Do the Fools Survive?".
In early 1979, Baxter and co-founding drummer John Hartman left the band.
Post-Doobie Brothers music career[edit]
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.
In 1982, he featured on Spirit's album Spirit of '84, released as The Thirteenth Dream outside of the USA.[8]
In 1984, Baxter sat in and played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites' Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney ("Tigger"), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ.[9] That same year, Baxter produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band's album Where the Beat Meets the Street on Columbia Records.
In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.[10]
In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and can be heard on the cast album. He was producer on a Bob Welch album in 1982, Eye Contact. In 1994 Baxter performed on the video game Tuneland. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video titled 'Guitar' (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc) where he travels the world and interviews respected guitarists he admires.
He continues accepting studio work; his most recent such work involved tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger's Language of the Heart, and The Beach Boys' That's Why God Made the Radio. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel B. Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration's Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow's band Beats Workin' at the Congressional Picnic held on the South Lawn of the White House.
JBL's Peter Chaikin interviewed CJ Vanston about his collaboration with Jeff Baxter on their forthcoming album, Skunk.[11][12]
Movies and TV[edit]
Baxter worked on King of the Hill (TV series) in 1997 composing songs for 3 episodes. "Peggy the Boggle Champ", "Hank's Unmentionables Problem", and "Square Peg". Also in 1997 he worked on two others as a composer, "The Blues Brothers Animated Series" (TV series), and "The Curse of Inferno" (TV series) . He composed work for " Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" (TV series) "Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat" in 1993. Composed for Pee-wee's Playhouse (TV series) "Tons of Fun" 1987. Beverly Hills, 90210 (TV series) "The Green Room" (1990) Credited soundtracks "Roxanne" 1987 writer and producer for the songs "Party Tonight", "Can This Be Love". "Class of 1984" 1982 "You Better Not Step Out of Line" / performer on "Suburbanite".
Baxter has appeared in a number of documentaries, including "Jan & Dean The Other Beach Boys" (2002), "The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Vol. 7 and 8" (1995), "American Bandstand's 40th Anniversary Special" (1995), TV series "What's Happening!!"

Defense consulting career[edit]
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, Baxter's interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use, specifically data-compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices. His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to Aviation Week magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point he wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system. He gave the paper to California Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Backed by several influential Capitol Hill lawmakers, Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.
Baxter's work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He now consults to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, as well as for defense-oriented manufacturers including Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason he became sought after by the government.
"We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,"[14] Baxter has said. "My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at."
Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News Channel advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.
In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Rep. Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.[15]
In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC).
Baxter was a member of an independent study group that produced the "Civil Applications Committee Blue Ribbon Study" recommending an increased domestic role for U.S. spy satellites in September 2005.[16] This study was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on August 15, 2007.[17]
Baxter is listed as "Senior Thinker and Raconteur" at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.[18]
Baxter is a Senior Fellow and Member of the Board of Regents at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.[19]

More recently, he has been working as a defense consultant and chairs a Congressional Advisory Board on missile defense.[1]

Early career[edit]
He was born in Washington, D.C.
While working at Manny's Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. For a short period during that year, Baxter was the bassist in a Hendrix-led band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, along with fellow Manny's employee Randy California. Baxter also worked as a guitar tech and amplifier repairman at Jack's Drum Shop on Boylston Street in Boston.
Baxter graduated from the Taft School[2] in Watertown, Connecticut and enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University[3] in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands.
Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.[4] Baxter joined the band for their third and final album, titled III.[5] After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart.[6][7]
With Steely Dan[edit]
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist. In 1972 he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer (and session player Elliott Randall on various tracks).
Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, Can't Buy a Thrill in 1972, Countdown to Ecstasy in 1973, and Pretzel Logic in 1974.[5]
With the Doobie Brothers[edit]
While finishing work on Pretzel Logic, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen's intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring, and to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on Vices as well as "South City Midnight Lady" on its predecessor, The Captain and Me. Baxter's first album as a full member of the group was 1975's Stampede. Baxter contributed an acoustic interlude entitled "Precis," significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar, and the guitar solo for the hit single "Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)".
While preparing to tour in support of Stampede, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald's vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter's jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album Takin' It to the Streets, 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line, and particularly 1978's Minute by Minute, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter's work on the album includes a noted performance at the end of "How Do the Fools Survive?".
In early 1979, Baxter and co-founding drummer John Hartman left the band.
Post-Doobie Brothers music career[edit]
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.
In 1982, he featured on Spirit's album Spirit of '84, released as The Thirteenth Dream outside of the USA.[8]
In 1984, Baxter sat in and played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites' Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney ("Tigger"), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ.[9] That same year, Baxter produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band's album Where the Beat Meets the Street on Columbia Records.
In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.[10]
In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and can be heard on the cast album. He was producer on a Bob Welch album in 1982, Eye Contact. In 1994 Baxter performed on the video game Tuneland. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video titled 'Guitar' (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc) where he travels the world and interviews respected guitarists he admires.
He continues accepting studio work; his most recent such work involved tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger's Language of the Heart, and The Beach Boys' That's Why God Made the Radio. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel B. Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration's Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow's band Beats Workin' at the Congressional Picnic held on the South Lawn of the White House.
JBL's Peter Chaikin interviewed CJ Vanston about his collaboration with Jeff Baxter on their forthcoming album, Skunk.[11][12]
Movies and TV[edit]
Baxter worked on King of the Hill (TV series) in 1997 composing songs for 3 episodes. "Peggy the Boggle Champ", "Hank's Unmentionables Problem", and "Square Peg". Also in 1997 he worked on two others as a composer, "The Blues Brothers Animated Series" (TV series), and "The Curse of Inferno" (TV series) . He composed work for " Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" (TV series) "Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat" in 1993. Composed for Pee-wee's Playhouse (TV series) "Tons of Fun" 1987. Beverly Hills, 90210 (TV series) "The Green Room" (1990) Credited soundtracks "Roxanne" 1987 writer and producer for the songs "Party Tonight", "Can This Be Love". "Class of 1984" 1982 "You Better Not Step Out of Line" / performer on "Suburbanite".
Baxter has appeared in a number of documentaries, including "Jan & Dean The Other Beach Boys" (2002), "The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Vol. 7 and 8" (1995), "American Bandstand's 40th Anniversary Special" (1995), TV series "What's Happening!!" Doobie or Not Doobie: Parts 1 and 2 with The Doobie Brothers (1978), "Emerson" (2013), "Turn It Up!" (2013), "Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who" (2007), "Overnight" (2003), "The Doobie Brothers: Let the Music Play" (2012), "The Making of 'Blues Brothers 2000" (1998) and "Guitar" (1991).[13]
Defense consulting career[edit]
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, Baxter's interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use, specifically data-compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices. His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to Aviation Week magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point he wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system. He gave the paper to California Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Backed by several influential Capitol Hill lawmakers, Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.
Baxter's work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He now consults to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, as well as for defense-oriented manufacturers including Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason he became sought after by the government.
"We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,"[14] Baxter has said. "My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at."
Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News Channel advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.
In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Rep. Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.[15]
In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC).
Baxter was a member of an independent study group that produced the "Civil Applications Committee Blue Ribbon Study" recommending an increased domestic role for U.S. spy satellites in September 2005.[16] This study was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on August 15, 2007.[17]
Baxter is listed as "Senior Thinker and Raconteur" at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.[18]
Baxter is a Senior Fellow and Member of the Board of Regents at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.[19]

Early career[edit]
He was born in Washington, D.C.
While working at Manny's Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. For a short period during that year, Baxter was the bassist in a Hendrix-led band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, along with fellow Manny's employee Randy California. Baxter also worked as a guitar tech and amplifier repairman at Jack's Drum Shop on Boylston Street in Boston.
Baxter graduated from the Taft School[2] in Watertown, Connecticut and enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University[3] in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands.
Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.[4] Baxter joined the band for their third and final album, titled III.[5] After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart.[6][7]
With Steely Dan[edit]
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist. In 1972 he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer (and session player Elliott Randall on various tracks).
Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, Can't Buy a Thrill in 1972, Countdown to Ecstasy in 1973, and Pretzel Logic in 1974.[5]
With the Doobie Brothers[edit]
While finishing work on Pretzel Logic, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen's intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring, and to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on Vices as well as "South City Midnight Lady" on its predecessor, The Captain and Me. Baxter's first album as a full member of the group was 1975's Stampede. Baxter contributed an acoustic interlude entitled "Precis," significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar, and the guitar solo for the hit single "Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)".
While preparing to tour in support of Stampede, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald's vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter's jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album Takin' It to the Streets, 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line, and particularly 1978's Minute by Minute, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter's work on the album includes a noted performance at the end of "How Do the Fools Survive?".
In early 1979, Baxter and co-founding drummer John Hartman left the band.
Post-Doobie Brothers music career[edit]
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.
In 1982, he featured on Spirit's album Spirit of '84, released as The Thirteenth Dream outside of the USA.[8]
In 1984, Baxter sat in and played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites' Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney ("Tigger"), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ.[9] That same year, Baxter produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band's album Where the Beat Meets the Street on Columbia Records.
In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.[10]
In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and can be heard on the cast album. He was producer on a Bob Welch album in 1982, Eye Contact. In 1994 Baxter performed on the video game Tuneland. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video titled 'Guitar' (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc) where he travels the world and interviews respected guitarists he admires.
He continues accepting studio work; his most recent such work involved tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger's Language of the Heart, and The Beach Boys' That's Why God Made the Radio. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel B. Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration's Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow's band Beats Workin' at the Congressional Picnic held on the South Lawn of the White House.
JBL's Peter Chaikin interviewed CJ Vanston about his collaboration with Jeff Baxter on their forthcoming album, Skunk.[11][12]
Movies and TV[edit]
Baxter worked on King of the Hill (TV series) in 1997 composing songs for 3 episodes. "Peggy the Boggle Champ", "Hank's Unmentionables Problem", and "Square Peg". Also in 1997 he worked on two others as a composer, "The Blues Brothers Animated Series" (TV series), and "The Curse of Inferno" (TV series) . He composed work for " Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" (TV series) "Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat" in 1993. Composed for Pee-wee's Playhouse (TV series) "Tons of Fun" 1987. Beverly Hills, 90210 (TV series) "The Green Room" (1990) Credited soundtracks "Roxanne" 1987 writer and producer for the songs "Party Tonight", "Can This Be Love". "Class of 1984" 1982 "You Better Not Step Out of Line" / performer on "Suburbanite".
Baxter has appeared in a number of documentaries, including "Jan & Dean The Other Beach Boys" (2002), "The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Vol. 7 and 8" (1995), "American Bandstand's 40th Anniversary Special" (1995), TV series "What's Happening!!"

Defense consulting career[edit]
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, Baxter's interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use, specifically data-compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices. His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to Aviation Week magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point he wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system. He gave the paper to California Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Backed by several influential Capitol Hill lawmakers, Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.
Baxter's work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He now consults to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, as well as for defense-oriented manufacturers including Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason he became sought after by the government.
"We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,"[14] Baxter has said. "My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at."
Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News Channel advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.
In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Rep. Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.[15]
In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC).
Baxter was a member of an independent study group that produced the "Civil Applications Committee Blue Ribbon Study" recommending an increased domestic role for U.S. spy satellites in September 2005.[16] This study was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on August 15, 2007.[17]
Baxter is listed as "Senior Thinker and Raconteur" at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.[18]
Baxter is a Senior Fellow and Member of the Board of Regents at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.[19]

While working at Manny's Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. For a short period during that year, Baxter was the bassist in a Hendrix-led band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, along with fellow Manny's employee Randy California. Baxter also worked as a guitar tech and amplifier repairman at Jack's Drum Shop on Boylston Street in Boston.
Baxter graduated from the Taft School[2] in Watertown, Connecticut and enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University[3] in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands.
Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.[4] Baxter joined the band for their third and final album, titled III.[5] After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart.[6][7]
With Steely Dan[edit]
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist. In 1972 he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer (and session player Elliott Randall on various tracks).
Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, Can't Buy a Thrill in 1972, Countdown to Ecstasy in 1973, and Pretzel Logic in 1974.[5]
With the Doobie Brothers[edit]
While finishing work on Pretzel Logic, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen's intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring, and to work almost exclusively with session players in the future. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on Vices as well as "South City Midnight Lady" on its predecessor, The Captain and Me. Baxter's first album as a full member of the group was 1975's Stampede. Baxter contributed an acoustic interlude entitled "Precis," significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar, and the guitar solo for the hit single "Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)".
While preparing to tour in support of Stampede, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald's vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter's jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album Takin' It to the Streets, 1977's Livin' on the Fault Line, and particularly 1978's Minute by Minute, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter's work on the album includes a noted performance at the end of "How Do the Fools Survive?".
In early 1979, Baxter and co-founding drummer John Hartman left the band.
Post-Doobie Brothers music career[edit]
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.
In 1982, he featured on Spirit's album Spirit of '84, released as The Thirteenth Dream outside of the USA.[8]
In 1984, Baxter sat in and played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites' Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney ("Tigger"), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ.[9] That same year, Baxter produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band's album Where the Beat Meets the Street on Columbia Records.
In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.[10]
In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He also appeared in the film Blues Brothers 2000 and can be heard on the cast album. He was producer on a Bob Welch album in 1982, Eye Contact. In 1994 Baxter performed on the video game Tuneland. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video titled 'Guitar' (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc) where he travels the world and interviews respected guitarists he admires.
He continues accepting studio work; his most recent such work involved tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger's Language of the Heart, and The Beach Boys' That's Why God Made the Radio. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel B. Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration's Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow's band Beats Workin' at the Congressional Picnic held on the South Lawn of the White House.
JBL's Peter Chaikin interviewed CJ Vanston about his collaboration with Jeff Baxter on their forthcoming album, Skunk.[11][12]
Movies and TV[edit]
Baxter worked on King of the Hill (TV series) in 1997 composing songs for 3 episodes. "Peggy the Boggle Champ", "Hank's Unmentionables Problem", and "Square Peg". Also in 1997 he worked on two others as a composer, "The Blues Brothers Animated Series" (TV series), and "The Curse of Inferno" (TV series) . He composed work for " Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories" (TV series) "Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat" in 1993. Composed for Pee-wee's Playhouse (TV series) "Tons of Fun" 1987. Beverly Hills, 90210 (TV series) "The Green Room" (1990) Credited soundtracks "Roxanne" 1987 writer and producer for the songs "Party Tonight", "Can This Be Love". "Class of 1984" 1982 "You Better Not Step Out of Line" / performer on "Suburbanite".

Defense consulting career[edit]
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, Baxter's interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software that was originally developed for military use, specifically data-compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices. His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to Aviation Week magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point he wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system. He gave the paper to California Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Backed by several influential Capitol Hill lawmakers, Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.
Baxter's work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He now consults to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, as well as for defense-oriented manufacturers including Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC"), Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has been quoted as saying his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason he became sought after by the government.
"We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,"[14] Baxter has said. "My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at."
Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News Channel advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.
In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Rep. Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.[15]
In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC).
Baxter was a member of an independent study group that produced the "Civil Applications Committee Blue Ribbon Study" recommending an increased domestic role for U.S. spy satellites in September 2005.[16] This study was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on August 15, 2007.[17]
Baxter is listed as "Senior Thinker and Raconteur" at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.[18]
Baxter is a Senior Fellow and Member of the Board of Regents at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.[19]
