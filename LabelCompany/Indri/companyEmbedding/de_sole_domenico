Details


La vergine del sole (The Sun Virgin) is a dramma serio which Domenico Cimarosa wrote for performance at the Russian Court during his tenure in St Petersburg as Maestro di cappella. The plot, by Ferdinando Moretti, revolves around the invasion of Peru (after the Mexican conquest) by the Spanish. A courageous soldier, Alonso Molina, outraged by the barbarian acts of the Spanish leader Pizzaro, has abandoned the Spanish army and fled to Quito to warn the king, Ataliba, and his sister, Aliloe, of their impending danger.Welcomed by the king and made a commander of his army, Alonso falls in love with Idalide, the daughter of Palmoro, a nobleman of the king.Much later, invited to the Temple of the Sun, Alonso is horrified to discover that his beloved Idalide has been ordered (by antique rule) to be one of the virgins of the gods, and discovers her at the sacrificial altar as the High Priest pronounces incantations. A volcano erupts, followed by an earthquake. More afraid for Idalide than for himself, Alonso enters the crumbling temple and rescues his beloved.
 In addition to performances in St Petersburg at both the Hermitage Theatre (where it probably had its prima in 1788) and at the Kamenniy Theatre on 26 October 1789, the opera was produced at Teatro Zagnoni in Bologna on 7 February 1790, in Warsaw on 3 July 1790, Brescia in 1790, and Madrid on 4 November 1790. It was heard in Lisbon on 25 July 1802 and again at St Petersburg in 1804. The most recent performance of record was at Teatro Valle in Rome during May of 1810.
 
 Because of the opera's dramatic story line, Cimarosa made full use of the St Petersburg orchestra, scoring the overtures for pairs of flutes, oboes, bassoons and horns in addition to timpani and strings. The exotic nature of the plot led the composer to write an overture much more chromatic and dramatic than anything he had written before. In addition, he included loud bursts of strings and timpani possibly to suggest the forthcoming volcanic eruption and earthquake. His unusual use of the timpani suggests, possibly, the native Peruvian sacrificial drums.
 
 This edition is based on the composer's holograph score which is today preserved in the library of the Conservatorio di musica 'S Pietro a Majella', Naples, under the shelfmark Rari 1-5-1. As is the case with all Cimarosa's autograph material the overture to La vergine del sole shows signs of having been composed at breakneck speed. Every conceivable notational shortcut is taken and his placement of articulation and dynamic markings is erratic. It has been necessary, therefore, to frequently interpret the composer's intentions and even at times to impose an editorial solution where his own thoughts are not clear. The timpani part is notated at pitch whereas the horns are written more conventionally in C in the autograph. In making sense of Cimarosa's score the style and notation of articulation and dynamic markings have been largely standardised throughout, and, where missing, markings have been reconstructed from parallel passages. These are indicated by the use of dotted slurs or brackets where appropriate. Obvious wrong notes have been corrected without comment; editorial emendations with no authority from the source are placed within brackets.

“Marketing is very important,” says the chairman of Tom Ford International, Domenico De Sole. “In luxury, you have to have an aesthetic, a vision for the brand. However, in the end, the product is everything.” (Photo by Tom Ford)








Exclusive Q&A: The boss of Tom Ford International discusses entrepreneurship, persistence, product quality, pragmatic creativity and the importance of thinking big.







Christian Barker: Together, you restored the fortunes of Gucci and built the company into one of the world’s pre-eminent fashion groups, and now you’ve established a multi-billion-dollar business in Tom Ford International. Suffice it to say, your partnership with Mr Ford is one of the most distinguished and successful in luxury. What is it about your personality and skillset that complements his personality and skillset?
Domenico De Sole: We’ve known each other for a long time. We’re very different, but we have the same vision about what a brand ought to be and what the vision of the brand should be — we’re very disciplined in understanding, especially the new company. We launched Tom Ford and everybody wanted to buy the products — but we wanted to keep it very exclusive. It’s a very complex universe. But we share the same vision and the same desire. I’m not a creative person, so I don’t design. One thing that helps me: Tom is a big persona in design and fashion, creativity. Everybody thinks of Tom as a creative director. The reality is he’s a very astute and rational person, and a very good businessperson. It’s very easy to have common ground with Tom, because he really understands. He understands business. If you’re creative, but not commercially aware, and nobody wants to buy your product, it’s useless.
The Tom Ford brand began with partnerships in eyewear, in fragrances. What was the strategy there?
 It was the type of products that Tom liked. Yes, it was a good financial base for the company. The key issue though, was that Tom liked them. You can’t force the designer to design products that he or she has no feeling for. It’s important to stay in an area that Tom would be comfortable in, that he really likes.
The quality level of all your products is stratospheric. I’m wearing one of your Private Blend fragrances, Azure Lime, which I put on at 8.30am and that will still be lingering when I get home at 8.30pm. Your garments and accessories, equally, are superbly constructed. It’s admirable, when so many fashion brands are all ‘smoke and mirrors’ — a veneer of luxury and glamour masking ordinary products.
 There are some businesses where marketing is very important. In luxury, you have to have an aesthetic, a vision for the brand. However, in the end, the product is everything. Of course, the stores must be consistent and all that — but if you peel that back, it’s the product. You can spend billions in marketing, but if the product is not consistent with the marketing, you won’t sell. You have to be clear about what the priority is. Tom has a great vision for the brand.
The Tom Ford suit is not only beautifully made, but incredibly distinctive in its shape, fit and details — a perfect melding of quality and aesthetics.
 Every great brand has to represent something. There are a lot of brands that make suits. But if we do suits like everyone else, there is no raison d’être. What Tom did [in creating the brand’s signature suit silhouette] was very exciting — it’s fashionable and it’s exciting. Even I wear it. I think you have to have a distinct look and distinct point of view. Otherwise nobody needed another brand to make nice suits.
One of the genius things about a Tom Ford suit is that its distinctive look pretty much functions as branding without a visible logo — I look at the lapels, the proportions, the nipped waist, the heroic shoulders and I know it’s a Tom Ford suit. Do you think that’s something that’s going to work in Asia, where more blatant branding seems to prevail?
 I think the Asian market has become a lot more sophisticated in the last few years. The brand is gaining much more traction. Menswear has always been strong in Asia. And we also have a very strong accessories market. In this market, accessories are the driver. I’m very bullish about Southeast Asia. With Gucci it was a very good business. Once you put together a good brand and a strong local customer base, it’s unbeatable.
Mr Ford recently stated his intention to grow the company into one of the five major luxury brands in the world. As chairman, the person responsible for overseeing that expansion, does that breadth of ambition daunt you, or does it excite you?
 At Gucci, a long time ago, a private equity firm owned the brand. It was not public yet. And I said [to the head of the equity firm]: “We’re going to be bigger than Chanel.” He said: “You’re crazy.” At the end of the day, you must have a great dream and great vision, or else you’ll never succeed.
Just a decade after founding the Tom Ford brand, you’re now doing roughly a billion dollars in sales annually. What advice would you give the founder of a start-up who aspired to generating similar revenue within 10 years of launching their business?
 My view is very simple — and that’s to stick it out. [In the early 1990s, before De Sole was appointed president, and Ford creative director] Gucci had been run into the ground. By the time we went public [in 1995], it was a really massive success. I recall my daughter asking me how we turned things around and I said: “Winners never quit.” I thought Gucci would be a great company. Even though it was broke, I always felt that if I stuck it out, the brand could be resurrected. And here we are now.

Domencio De Sole, the chairman of Tom Ford International, has also been named chairman of Sotheby’s. De Sole was named an independent director of Sotheby’s in 2013. In his new role as chairman of the board, De Sole will be working with Sotheby’s new president and CEO Tad Smith. Smith was formerly the president and CEO of The Madison Square Garden Company. This will be the first time that the roles of chairman and president will be separate for Sotheby’s. Smith will take on his role as president and CEO of Sotheby’s starting March 31st.
Prior to his role as the chairman of Tom Ford International, De Sole was the former president and CEO of the Gucci Group, which is now part of Kering. Under De Sole, the Gucci group went from a single failing label to acquiring brands like Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Stella McCartney, and Alexander McQueen. He eventually built the company into a $3 billion business. De Sole had planned to retire to his Hilton Head retreat with his wife Eleanore De Sole after 20 years in the business when he left Gucci Group, according to the Wall Street Journal, until Tom Ford lured him back into the fashion business. De Sole is also on the board of directors at Gap Inc. and Telecom Italia. In his latest role, he will be succeeding William F. Ruprecht, who had served as CEO of Sotheby’s since 2000.

Domenico De Sole Testimony Continues at Knoedler Trial - artnet News























































 

 






































Art World
Domenico De Sole’s Background Questioned on Day Four of Knoedler Forgery Trial
The defense grilled De Sole about Freedman's 11 Rothko experts.

The drama continued in Manhattan on Thursday at the trial of New York’s Knoedler & Company gallery, as plaintiff Domenico de Sole spent a second day on the witness stand, accusing defendant and art dealer Ann Freedman of fraud in the 2005 sale of a painting, for $8.3 million, that was purported to be by Mark Rothko but turned out to be fake.
Despite the massive scandal surrounding the demise of the gallery, which shuttered abruptly in 2011 following the discovery of an $80 million-dollar art forgery ring, the current case is the only lawsuit connected to the disgraced gallery to come to trial to date.
In January 2005, De Sole and his wife Eleanor finalized a deal to buy what they believed was an untitled 1956 Rothko. The canvas in question made a surprise appearance in court on Wednesday, January 27, in conjunction with impassioned testimony from De Sole.

There were several heated moments on Thursday as well, with De Sole and the defense attorney repeatedly butting heads as they attempted to speak over one another, and Judge Gardelphe angrily reminding the defense to raise “questions, not arguments.” Over and over, De Sole stressed that Freedman “did all the talking” during the sale and “said the painting was beautiful, a masterpiece.”
De Sole was allegedly told that the Rothko was one of two previously undiscovered works, the other by Jackson Pollock, that were part of a Swiss collection. He was told that the owner, originally from Mexico, had purchased the works directly from the artist with the assistance of esteemed dealer and art adviser David Herbert. He had since died, and his son, who wished to remain anonymous, was selling the art. (A key point in the case is whether Freedman told anyone that she personally knew the fictional Swiss collector, or if a personal relationship between the two was only implied.)

In fact, the purported masterpieces were being sold by Knoedler on behalf of Long Island art dealer Glafira Rosales. She allegedly conspired with her boyfriend, Jose Carlos Bergantinos Diaz, and his brother, Jesus Angel Bergantinos Diaz, to pass off works from a Chinese painter based in Flushing, Queens, as Abstract Expressionist originals by the likes of Rothko, Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell.
In 2013, after being indicted in a criminal case, Rosales cooperated with federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty. She is awaiting sentencing. The Diaz brothers were arrested in Spain in April 2014, but have not yet been extradited to the US. The forger, Pei Shen Qian, who was reportedly paid minimal sums for his work, has fled to China.
The defense seemed eager to pin the responsibility for determining the painting’s authenticity on the De Soles and Jim Kelly, the art dealer who helped arrange the transaction on the couple’s behalf.

The defense suggested that De Sole should have been suspicious of the list of 11 Rothko experts Freedman had cited as having approved the work, because it would seem like overkill to have more than a few people involved in such a process. Kelly effectively debunked this line of argument in the afternoon when he pointed out how impressed he was with Freedman’s apparent due diligence.
“She had done such a good job organizing these experts,” said Kelly. Christopher Rothko, the artist’s son, Rothko expert David Anfam, and Laila Nasr, a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, were among those cited by Freedman, and were all announced as potential witnesses during the trial’s opening on Monday.

Another key to the defense’s case appeared to be whether or not De Sole actually read the letter from Freedman sent before the purchase to reiterate her claims about the painting’s provenance and authenticity. De Sole was unable to definitively recall having personally read the letter, and had attested in a pre-trial deposition that he had not. “This forms such an important part of the lawsuit,” the defense claimed, for which the Judge Gardelphe quickly reprimanded him.
Although the defense pointed out that Freedman’s letter only claimed that the 11 experts had “viewed” the painting, not that they had authenticated it, both De Sole and Kelly were fairly certain that the dealer had used the word “authenticated” during their verbal conversations. Kelly noted that it was a “very stellar” list of experts, telling the court “it meant to me that these people had attested to its authenticity, that they agreed with Ann.”

The defense also attempted to draw a parallel between De Sole’s job as a Gucci executive and Freedman’s role as an art dealer, asking De Sole if Gucci salespeople were in the practice of assuring customers of the authenticity of their handbags. “We never were in the business of selling fake products,” said De Sole. “If there was a problem, we’d give the customer a refund.”
Just as a Gucci customer would never expect the luxury brand to peddle knock-off goods, De Sole had full confidence in the good name of the Knoedler gallery and Freedman, saying, “It never crossed my mind that this was a fake painting.” The defense also alluded to De Sole’s law degree, asking if he was a lawyer. “No,” said De Sole, “because I’ve been selling handbags for the last 35 years.”
Much of the afternoon was dedicated to testimony from Sharon Flescher, the executive director of the International Foundation of Art Research (IFAR). In late 2001, the organization’s art authentication research service was asked by collector Jack Levy to authenticate a purported Jackson Pollock he had purchased from Knoedler.

As soon as Freedman got word of Levy’s intentions, she called up Flescher to say that Knoedler would once again be making an annual contribution to the organization—even though it was just nine days before the year’s end—and to talk about Levy’s painting. Flescher’s notes from that conversation stated that Freedman alluded to experts who had “blessed” the painting, and claimed that it had passed to the Swiss collector through Filipino-born artist Alfonso Ossorio, a close friend and important patron of Pollock’s. (With regard to this painting, there was no mention of Herbert.)
Ultimately, IFAR was unable to find any evidence to support Freedman’s claims about the work’s provenance, noting in its final report that it was “inconceivable” that they had missed documents that linked the painting to Ossorio, who had worked closely with those compiling the artist’s catalogue raisonné. A panel of anonymous experts were ultimately split on whether or not the work appeared authentic, with one quoted in the report as saying, “It doesn’t ring true.”
Although IFAR did not definitively rule the Levy Pollock a fake, the implication was certainly that its findings should have been enough to cast doubt on all of the works Rosales was selling. (Previous testimony had already covered fake Richard Diebenkorn paintings that came to Knoedler via Rosales, and the doubts about their authenticity expressed by the artist’s daughter long before they were ever sold.)

Biography
Domineco De Sole is chairman of 

                        Tom Ford
 International, a role he has held since the company was founded in April 2005.
De Sole and Ford met whilst at Gucci, where the pair’s shared vision for the Gucci brand would become one of fashion’s greatest success stories. De Sole, as Gucci’s president, guided the brand from near bankruptcy, and played an instrumental role in building the Gucci Group, a luxury conglomerate that would eventually include: Yves 

                        Saint Laurent
, Bottega Veneta, Boucheron, Sergio Rossi, 

                        Stella McCartney
, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. De Sole’s presidency would also see him successfully defend an alleged hostile take-over bid by 

                        Bernard Arnault
’s LVMH.
De Sole exited Gucci, with Ford, in April 2004.
Although De Sole had intended to retire, he soon agreed, in 2005, to enter into business with Ford once again, claiming he “wouldn’t know what else to do if he didn’t work.” De Sole and Ford founded Tom Ford International through two licensing deals, one with Estée Lauder for beauty, and a second to create eyewear with the Marcolin Group.
The brand’s steady and astute expansion, which now includes womenswear and menswear, is a testament to De Sole’s thorough awareness of the challenges of today’s market, and the opportunities within it.
 
The seasoned executive has served on the boards of Gap, Procter & Gamble, Bausch & Lomb, Telecom Italia, and on the advisory board of Harvard Law School, his alma mater. De Sole left Procter & Gamble, prior to launching the Tom Ford fragrances, in order to avoid any conflict of interest, but the indefatigable executive took up a role on the board of Ermenegildo Zegna SpA instead.
He is known for his loyalty, modesty and geniality. He remains in contact with many of the designers from his days at the Gucci Group, including Nicolas Ghesquière, Stella McCartney and Thomas Maier.
De Sole and his wife Eleanore are keen art collectors and have two daughters together.

Auctions
Domenico De Sole Speaks About the Knoedler Fraud Trial
De Sole said he would have "walked away" in exchange for a refund.

The Knoedler forgery trial, in which collectors Eleanore and Domenico De Sole sued the now-shuttered Knoedler & Co. gallery and its former president Ann Freedman for $25 million, for the sale of a fake Mark Rothko painting, kicked off on January 25, and was expected to last about four weeks.
The trial ended sooner than expected. On Sunday, February 7, a little over two weeks after the plaintiffs began presenting their case with testimony and evidence, Freedman settled with the De Soles. Just a few days later, the gallery and its related holding company, 8-31 Holdings, settled with the plaintiffs. The De Soles, who testified independently, were in court each day from the start of the trial. However, on the morning of Wednesday February 10, when news of the settlement officially emerged, neither was present.
With the agreement having been largely hammered out on the preceding afternoon (February 9), Domenico De Sole had already departed for Atlanta for board meetings by Wednesday morning, according to his attorney, Gregory Clarick.

“I’m happy that we went to court,” De Sole told artnet News from his home in Aspen this past weekend about the trial overall, “as the truth was established.”
Of more than 10 lawsuits filed so far over the sales of fake paintings that were brought to Knoedler by Long Island dealer Glafira Rosales, the De Soles’ suit is the only one to make it to trial so far. Several more cases are pending.

In late 2010, after stories started to surface about fake paintings purportedly by Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock being sold through Knoedler, the De Soles hired forensic analyst James Martin to investigate their paintings.
“When Jamie Martin’s report, which I believed and trusted, came back that the Rothko was a fake,” said De Sole, “[Freedman, Knoedler, and 8-31 holdings] were insistent that this was not the case and that it was authentic. My point of view was, ‘Fine, if it’s authentic, give me my $8.3 million back and I’ll walk away. Now you can sell this authentic Rothko for more than twice as much, $18 million, or whatever and you can make a huge profit.’ When they absolutely refused to do that I knew that, one, the Rothko was definitely a fake, and two, they knew for sure that it was a fake.”
A painting sold by Knoedler as a Mark Rothko that turned out to be fake.
Freedman and Knoedler’s attorneys initially disputed the fact that the paintings were fake, offering theories about certain paint pigments being available to artists before being made commercially available, or casting doubt on methods used to analyze the works.
Indeed, between the time that the De Soles purchased the purported Rothko from Knoedler in 2004 and the time that they subjected it to forensic analysis via James Martin of Orion Analytical roughly seven years later, the market for Rothko, along with the broader contemporary art market, had soared.
For instance in 2007 at Christie’s New York, a 1950 Rothko painting White center (Yellow, pink and lavender on rose) shattered previous price levels when it sold for $72.8 million. The following year, also at Christie’s, a 1952 Rothko, No. 15, sold for $50 million. Rothko’s prices have risen even higher in the ensuing years. In 2014, a new record of $86.9 million for Orange, Red Yellow (1961), was set at Christie’s, New York.
This past May, another painting, No. 10 (1958), sold for $81.9 million at Christie’s New York, establishing the second highest auction price for the artist ever. To date, according to the artnet Price Database, seven Rothko paintings have been sold at auction for more than $50 million each. Two dozen works have sold for more than $20 million each, and 35 works have sold above $10 million a piece.
What is De Sole going to do now that the case has settled?
“I’m going to sleep for a few days,” he said.

Supports K@W's Leadership Content 


Domenico De Sole is chairman of Tom Ford International, the menswear brand that now includes beauty, accessories, fragrance and footwear. He is a lawyer by training, but made the transition to the fashion business when Gucci — one of his clients — hired him to join the company. That was in 1984. Over the next 20 years until his departure from Gucci in 2004, he engineered a remarkable turnaround, saving the company from hostile suitors and acquiring such key brands as Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. Indeed, in the fashion world, the standard phrase for managing a successful turnaround has become “doing a Gucci.” Knowledge@Wharton asked De Sole to talk about the fashion business in a down economy, the consumer mentality, leadership and how he has managed to be so successful in what might be considered a turbulent industry. 
An edited transcript of the conversation follows.
Knowledge@Wharton: Thank you for joining us.







Domenico De Sole: You’re welcome.
Knowledge@Wharton: My questions to you a year ago would have been very different than they are today.
Domenico De Sole: I’m sure.
Knowledge@Wharton: Given what’s going on in the economy in general — and in the fashion business, in particular — how’s business today? And what strategies are you adopting to minimize the downturn?
De Sole: Business — I’m talking about in general — is very difficult for all the luxury companies. They have been through an obviously huge crisis last fall that is continuing. I have been in the business a long time, and I have never seen anything that was so deep and so worldwide. Asia is still working reasonably well, China is still growing, Hong Kong is still growing, but every other country has had very difficult times. Business has been very, very weak. 
There are a lot of factors — obviously the general economic situation [is one]. Japan’s economy has been very difficult for a long time now, and this year particularly [so]. I was in Japan last week and it was all over the press that exports in Japan have declined 46% in the last quarter. So you can imagine how [hard] it is for the economy. 

Domenico De Sole, chairman of Tom Ford International, shares his perspective on the fashion business in a down economy

In the United States, it is a combination of factors impacting the luxury industry. The first one is certainly the general economic situation, the financial meltdown of this fall, but on top of that there is another factor occurring in the United States. At the beginning of November last year, one department store in particular that carries a lot of luxury brands suddenly went on sale. A very radical approach. Marking everything down 70%. This created a very complex situation because the whole fashion business — and all the great luxury companies — have stores in New York, so we were confronted with a very complicated situation. 
Some followed the lead and marked down products in a way which was really unprecedented. Obviously it’s very difficult to tell your consumers now that, in the spring season, products are full-price, that they are supposed to buy [at] full-price, something they were giving away three months ago. So I think in the United States there is an added factor that is creating a difficult time for luxury brands. 
But business is difficult everywhere, as I said, with the exception of China and Hong Kong. Korea actually is doing reasonably well because the won has depreciated so there are a lot of tourists who go to Korea to buy luxury goods. But by and large, it’s a very difficult climate. I sense, and actually I believe, that 2009 is going to be a very, very difficult year. I doubt that there’s going to be a recovery [in 2009]. And I think we probably will continue to have difficult times in 2010 with the situation improving towards the end of 2010/2011. So I have a rather realistic — I wouldn’t say pessimistic — view. 
However, there are really a lot of schools of thought about the long term.  I’ve been around for a long time and I always have always heard after horrible situations — like economic depressions or events like 9/11 — I’ve always heard: “Things have changed forever.” I just don’t believe it. I think that consumers — people — forget. It’s human nature. People are optimistic — most of them — by nature. So I am convinced that obviously we will do quite well. The luxury industry will come back. The real question that nobody knows [the answer to] is how long it’s going to take. Nobody knows. My guess is that it’s going to take some time. But long term, I’m quite optimistic.
Knowledge@Wharton: What kind of strategy would you suggest a luxury goods company follow?


Knowledge@Wharton High School






De Sole: The strategy for all luxury goods — and I think excellent managers understand this strategy — should be the traditional set of managing for cash in difficult times. Watch your costs very aggressively. But, at the time same, stay the course with the brand. Discounting prices really doesn’t make a lot of sense. At the end of the day, it is imperative for luxury companies to deliver good value. It doesn’t mean the price has to be lower. Just make sure that whatever is delivered is a good value — great quality, great fashion, great brand…. The savviest people know that the number one [strategy] is to stay the course.
Knowledge@Wharton: I know that attorneys are often hired by the people they represent. But to go from a job handling tax matters for a Washington, D.C. law firm to becoming CEO of Gucci, that’s quite a switch. Why did you make that move, and why do you think it worked so well over that 20-year time span?
De Sole: First of all, the move was really by chance. I was representing one side of the Gucci family. The company had a huge tax problem at some point back in the early 1980s. Some [family members] asked me to become president of Gucci America to help them resolve the tax issues, which I did. In the meantime, the American company had a lot of problems. So I fixed the problems and stayed there. The company did quite well, actually. When the last family member took over the company, unfortunately, he was not the best manager. In 1994, the old group went bankrupt — stopped paying employees — so the shareholders at the time, a private equity company, purchased the shares of Maurizio Gucci. The other members of the family asked me in 1994 to move from the United States to Italy where I became the CEO of Gucci Group. That [just] happened to me. There was no planning there. In fact, [at one point] in 1994, I considered going  back to be a lawyer until I got a phone call and I was asked to move to Italy to see if I could fix the company.
Knowledge@Wharton: You are credited with saving Gucci from bankruptcy — making it profitable and prestigious once again — by using what one newspaper called “American style management practices.” I’m wondering what those practices were and how you implemented them.
De Sole: I would say that has been defined very simply. The company was broke in 1994. I tried to liquidate business in a very rational, analytical way. Most important, I am a very driven person, and I think I had very clear ideas at that time because I had already served for several years as president of Gucci America. So I had a pretty good understanding of the company’s problems. I just parachuted into a situation which was catastrophic. But by the same token, I recognized that there were a lot of very competent people, and I thought that I turned out to be a good leader. I rallied them and made sure that everybody understood the direction we were going. I always was able to deal with people well. I came from a culture also in which I recognized talent, so I’m not afraid of surrounding myself with competent people. And most important, I was very lucky because the other survivor who was there as the company was collapsing was Tom Ford. They wanted to fire Tom Ford, but I thought that was really stupid. I thought Tom Ford was quite good.
Knowledge@Wharton: As a designer.
De Sole: As a designer. I said, ‘Well, I think this guy is great’. So I convinced Tom to stay — to become creative director of the company. It was a brilliant decision because Tom turned out to be probably the great designer of the last 50 years. And we work well together. But not only with him. We had a great team. I was able to get everybody on the same page. We had a very clear strategy. Everybody understood where we were going. And we made decisions very quickly. There was this great sense of urgency, and so everything worked out well. In fact, when I arrived in Florence from the United States after leaving Gucci America to take over the company, the CFO of InvestCorp, which was the owner of Gucci at the time, welcomed me in Florence. We were in the cafeteria and he said: “Well, I hope you can do something here because Gucci is an albatross around our neck.” Less than two years later, they sold the company and made $2 billion in profit. 
Knowledge@Wharton: There are stories about high-profiled, high-powered businessmen executives starting out together in a business relationship and then for some reason coming to blows. I know that you and Tom Ford bring different strengths to the current partnership at Tom Ford International, but that aside, what makes the relationship between the two of you work so well?
De Sole: First of all, there’s a great relationship of trust in the sense that I trust Tom 1,000% and I think he trusts me 1,000%. The second thing I think is that we have very deep respect. Tom is a creative genius. Also, I really do believe that in life, to be successful, you have to have knowledge of two important things: one, what you know, and two, what you don’t know. I’m totally aware that I’m not a creative person. I understand a collection. I can tell you if it’s going to sell, or not going to sell. I do very well with that. But I’m not a creative person. I wouldn’t know how to do it. I have a great immense respect for Tom and his expertise. So there is a very clear definition of roles.
Also, I have to tell you that I really have an extraordinary admiration for Tom. You see, as a businessman, you can learn about merchandise. You can learn about stores. You can learn to understand what is a good product, what is a bad product, what is a good fashion show, what is not a good fashion show. However, being creative is a totally different universe. I think creative people can see things that normal human beings cannot. So, and always, most importantly, I treat Tom with immense respect…. Businessmen are a dime a dozen. Creative people are truly extraordinary. 
Knowledge@Wharton: Do you have a sense of how social networking sites, viral marketing, buzz marketing, product placement, all these new marketing techniques — how they are changing the way we perceive and buy fashion?
De Sole: There are a lot of ways these days to get your story around. I would say that over the last year I’ve seen [some of them] become very, very important. It was started a long time ago with celebrities being dressed by designers. That [phenomenon] has become very popular, [helped] by all sorts of gossip magazines [covering] who’s wearing what, when. It has been spread [even more] by the Internet. So it has become much more prominent and important.
By the same token, I really do believe that excellent PR and the ability to project the image of the brand consistently is still very, very important. That’s one of the real great strengths of Tom. Not only do we have a great designer who can design beautiful clothes and wonderful accessories [but we have someone] with an amazing eye and amazing marketing ability. He’s done some of the greatest campaigns. I still buy old-fashioned magazines just to look at the ads. It’s amazing to me how many people now are redoing what we were doing with Tom in1994 and1995. Tom was really avant-guard. 
Knowledge@Wharton: Given all these marketing techniques though, do you feel that it’s more difficult to control the brand image?
De Sole: Yes and no. At the end of the day, it is very, very important to be very disciplined with everything you do. I think that can always be controlled. I think it’s up to the management of any brand to make sure that the image of the brand is always controlled. 
Knowledge@Wharton: In what ways do you think that the financial downturn has changed consumers? You started out talking about this, about how consumers are now pushing back on price. They are much more sale and discount conscious. Will this be a long-term change or, as you touched on earlier, might they revert back to their old ways once the recession is over?
De Sole: Again, nobody knows the real answer. But my instinct tells me that this difficult time is going to last. It’s not going to be fixed in a few months. I think that people obviously are very concerned. But my experience is that at the end of the day, the consumer forgets. People love luxury brands. Historically, if you think about it, during the Stone Age, people were buying bracelets and earrings made of stone. So it’s something that’s part of human nature. My sense is that things will get back to being good. The real issue is, that it’s going to last some time. I think that it’s going to be a year, or two, or three. But nobody knows. 
Knowledge@Wharton: Can you name two or three leadership qualities that you think an executive needs to manage successfully?
De Sole: Yes. First of all, I really do believe that the most important thing is to be able to communicate effectively with your own people…. I had this habit from day one that I would go into the cafeteria of the company in Florence, and I continued that throughout my career. Every two or three weeks I would talk to people — everybody, including cleaning people — and just tell them how the company was doing, what we were trying to do. I think it’s very important that everybody in the company understand what the mission is, what we are trying to do. Everybody is trying to be on the same page. I think that’s the most important thing in leadership.
Obviously the second thing would be to hire very competent people. That was a little bit natural for me because you have to understand I came from legal background. If you are in a law firm, it’s not very hierarchical. And if somebody was number one in his class at Harvard Law School, for example,  it doesn’t matter that he or she is young. There’s respect for intellectual ability. I always wanted to hire competent people. And I want to hear what they have to say. It’s very important for a leader to be open-minded and invite debate and [get] people to talk about the issues very openly. 
Also, the last family member who ran [Gucci] was doing a lot of things that I thought didn’t make any sense. So, in part, I learned a negative way just by looking at what was going on and [wondering] why these guys are doing this. I remember this one example: Every time there was a problem, this gentleman would try to find out who [had caused] it. That was basically silly. In a company, it is an issue of processes. If a mistake is made, I don’t care who’s done it. We have to understand why we made the mistake and just make sure that we look forward and don’t repeat it. This sort of hunt for the culprit I thought was very silly. 
So we had a great management team. We became really stars in the industry because of a phenomenal management team. We hired all the best people. It was a very open management style. My door was always open. I would talk to anybody. I tried to hire great people and let them do their job. We worked very well.
Knowledge@Wharton: What are your expansion plans going forward for Tom Ford International?
De Sole: We are a very young company. We opened — with really immense success — our first store in New York just a year and a half ago. We are now present in some of the best locations — Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus in the United States, Harrods in London. We opened a beautiful store in Milan last year. So the plan for the next year and half is to open in the United States in Beverly Hills and in probably Las Vegas. We’re looking at a project there. Obviously the most important step would be to expand in Asia. We’ll be opening this fall in Yoshikin in Tokyo and in the Galleria in Korea, which is like the Bergdorf Goodman of Korea, and then looking at China and Hong Kong. So that would be the next step…. I was really not expecting the economy to collapse, but that’s life, you know. You have to manage whatever comes your way.
Knowledge@Wharton: My last question is, what advice would you give to any man or woman who has just been named head of a fashion house?
De Sole: I would, because of the difficult times, manage for cash. But the most important thing is, some would say, just stay the course. You understand what your brand is all about. You can’t really start changing everything — that would be the worst thing to do. Stay the course. One thing I also found that was very, very important in our business — I spend an enormous amount of time visiting stores. I used to talk to the store people all the time. Because if you really want to know what is going on in the retail business, you should go and talk to the sales people. They are there. They see the customers every day. They know what is working. So my biggest advice is just devote the time [to do this]. At the end of the day, the store is the soul of the brand. You know, most people are not sophisticated about fashion. A brand is your store. For example, if you mention Chanel to people, they think immediately about the Chanel store. So traveling to stores, being in them, understanding the store, making sure the brand is properly presented — I think this is very important. If you want to be an effective CEO of a brand, devote time to understanding your market.

Domenico De Sole, Gucci's Savior



  The last of the family managers had also allowed the company to sell such vulgarities as plastic and canvas luggage with the Gucci name, and Gucci goods were then paled on sale not just in Gucci stores but in plebeian department stores.  De Sole took over in 1993.  He had previously decided to abandon the somewhat unpredictable business climate of Italy to build a legal career in American.  He first helped Maurizio Gucci with a problem in 1984, and at that time Gucci lured De Sole from his law firm in Washington, D.C. to be the leader of Gucci's American subsidiary through a tax investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, which he did successfully.  Investcorp, which also owns other luxury companies such as Ebel, a Swiss watchmaker, and Chaumet, a French jeweller, took over Gucci from the family in September 1993, and at that time De Sole was summoned back to Italy to take charge of the entire company ("The velvet revolution" 70).De Sole was faced with two immediate tasks when he took over stewardship of the company.  First, he had to continue with the much-needed housekeeping which Investcorp had already started by such actions as cutting product lines; improving quality (no more plastic); closing unprofitable outlets; overhauling  stock-control and ordering-systems; and selling a palatial office in Milan in order to move Gucci's headquarters back to Florence.  Second, he had the more difficult task of making the Gucci name desirable in the marketplace once more.  In this regard, he decided that the company should become a  modern fashion house rather than continuing to concentrate on "classics" such as loafer shoes decorated with a horse's bit (first made in 1962) or handbags with bent bamboo handles (produced since 1947).  De Sole then handed over creative control to Tom Ford, an American designer, and the latter's use of vivid satin and deep velvet was the success ...
