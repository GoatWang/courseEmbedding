Why ForSaleByOwner.com?


							Navigate your homeownership to a safe harbor by selling ‘by owner.’  
							Set the right price,  
							understand prevailing market trends through our blog,
							use our articles, special tools 
							and home finance information and calculators to chart your course.
							Make sure your buyer finds your house on line through our powerful listing services.
							It’s your ship. Be the captain!
						



Benefits of Buying & Selling By Owner






Buyers

							Homes for sale ‘by owner’ are often the best value in any neighborhood.  
							That is because owners have maximum negotiating flexibility, especially when they 
							don’t have a listing agent’s commission soaking up 3% or more of the sale 
							price. Of course, we encourage ‘by owner’ sellers to cover all or part 
							of the buyer’s agent commission, so there’s still no cost to you. And 
							check out our step-by-step guide to buying a house directly from the owner. 
						
Learn More »


Sellers

							Sell your home ‘by owner’ and it will stand out in any neighborhood. 
							You will be in control of marketing, pricing, 
							and negotiating — critical tasks that can’t be trusted to an agent who doesn’t 
							have your best interests at heart.
						

							Your first step to ‘sold’ is to make the most of ForSaleByOwner.com’s powerful 
							listing tools that ensure that your house 
							will ‘get found’ by buyers searching online right now for their next home.

Foreclosures For Sale



						The more foreclosures in the neighborhood, the greater their impact on the market value of all 
						neighborhood homes. You can track foreclosure rates through local legal notices and property 
						tax records; doing so will help you detect trends that will affect the value of your home.
						You can also search foreclosure listings on ForSaleByOwner.com

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...





Home Values & Sold Home Prices

Ever wonder, "how much is my house worth?" Search by state, city, zip code, or address to find homes recently sold in your neighborhood.
