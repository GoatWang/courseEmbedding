Alpine 4 Technologies Announces That Its Subsidiary ALTIA Has Successfully Concluded Its Pilot Program With Earnhardt Chevrolet

PHOENIX, July 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: ALPP), a technology and manufacturing holding company announced today that its subsidiary ALTIA has successfully concluded its 90 day pilot with Phoenix, AZ-based Earnhardt Auto Centers of its innovative 6th Sense Auto product platform. The pilot program was installed at the Earnhardt Chevrolet dealership in Chandler, AZ and performed well above expectations and will continue on in the store for the foreseeable future.  ALTIA is also in negotiations with several other large automotive groups regarding its 6th Sense Auto and BrakeActive aftermarket products and anticipates larger orders in late Q3 and Q4 2017.
6th Sense Auto is designed for the modern "connected car" and dedicated to helping large dealerships like Earnhardt improve their inventory management, engine diagnostics, service maintenance and personalized customer support through wireless, cloud-based software. 
Charlie Winters, Chairman of the Board and Alpine 4's Automotive Advisor had this to say: "The pilot program did not disappoint.  Our 6th Sense Auto product concluded with a 53% sell through rate in June on retail deals to the Earnhardt Chevrolet customer base and is expected to generate a steady stream of recurrent revenue for ALTIA and should expand when more dealership groups are signed on." 
With roughly 40 million new and used cars sold in the United States annually, ALTIA's market opportunity is very large and we believe that our 6th Sense Auto product is positioned to be a dominant player in this industry, noted Kent B. Wilson CEO of Alpine 4 Technologies.
About Earnhardt Auto Centers
Since 1951, the Earnhardt famly has been selling cars and trucks to people across the southwest United States. The company was founded by Tex Earnhardt who, at the age of 21, became the youngest Ford franchise owner in the U.S. Today, the Earnhardt family continues to own and operate the 23 dealerships and personally oversees their operations.

Jul 11 17
Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd. reported earnings results for the first quarter of 2017 and provided earnings guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2017. For the second quarter, the company revenue grew from $1.78 million in quarter four of 2016 to $2.45 million in quarter one of 2017. This came primarily from the acquisition of Horizon Well Testing and commitment to the oil field services industry. The company reported a loss Of $537,000. Most of the loss associated with quarter one of 2017 came from one primary but distinct reason, which was a result of the mobilization oil field services company Horizon Well Testing to service sites they work in. 

The company is anticipating to generate its first positive net earnings in quarter three of 2017, and believes the remainder of 2017 will also produce positive net earnings.

PHOENIX, Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: ALPP), a technology and manufacturing holding company initially targeting the national automobile dealership market, announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Elio Motors Inc. (OTCQX: ELIO) to provide the innovative high mileage vehicle manufacturer its 6th Sense Auto™ and BrakeActive products, as well as related manufacturing, data sharing and engineering resources. 








Elio Motors, based in Phoenix, is a high-profile startup vehicle manufacturer planning to launch an ultra-efficient, two-person three-wheel vehicle, the Elio, that will get up to 84 mpg with a set base price of $7,300*. The Elio, to be sold initially in the U.S. market, will be built at a former General Motors plant in Shreveport, LA. More than 64,000 customer reservations have been recorded for the Elio and the Company anticipates commercial mass production to begin in 2018.
Strong current demand is reflected by over 64,000 customer reservations. Management anticipates assembling the 100 S1 prototypes for real-world evaluation during 2017 with commercial mass production to follow in 2018.
The LOI between Alpine 4 and Elio Motors also includes the sharing of such things as sales data and user acceptance, and all data collected from the cloud-based 6th Sense Auto System. 6th Sense Auto is designed for the modern "connected car" and collects data on such things as inventory management, engine diagnostics, service maintenance and personalized customer support through wireless software. 
BrakeActive is an innovative, high-margin aftermarket programmable brake-light safety device. Its technology improves a vehicle's third brake light in order to substantially reduce or prevent rear-end collisions. According to the National Highway Safety Administration, rear-end collisions can be reduced by 90 percent if trailing vehicles have one additional second to react. BrakeActive assists in providing that extra time to react.
"We are putting together a team of world-class suppliers that are helping us meet our stringent cost, fuel efficiency, safety and performance goals," said Paul Elio, CEO of Elio Motors. "To create the most advanced vehicles on the global market in terms of modern engineering, rider comforts and fuel efficiency, we need suppliers like Alpine 4's subsidiary ALTIA and their cloud-based innovations and safety products." 
Both the Sixth Sense Auto product platform and the BrakeActive products are manufactured and engineered in-house by Alpine 4's subsidiary ALTIA.
"Creating a business relationship with an OEM vehicle manufacturer like Elio Motors is an important milestone for Alpine 4," said Alpine 4 CEO Kent B. Wilson. "Our goal is to provide our product portfolio to a variety of customers in the automotive industry. We are very excited to be working with such an important and high-profile company like Elio Motors, which promises to be a world leader in the high-efficiency subcompact market." 
About Elio Motors
Founded by car enthusiast Paul Elio in 2009, Elio Motors Inc. represents a revolutionary approach to manufacturing an ultra-high-mileage vehicle. The three-wheel Elio is engineered to attain a highway mileage rating of up to 84 mpg, while providing the comfort of amenities such as power windows, power door lock, air conditioning and cruise control, accompanied by the safety of multiple air bags and an aerodynamic, enclosed vehicle body. Elio's first manufacturing site will be in Shreveport, LA.

Alpine 4 Technologies Announces That Its Subsidiary ALTIA Has Successfully Concluded Its Pilot Program With Earnhardt Chevrolet
6th Sense Auto Product Platform Improves Inventory Management, Service Maintenance, Customer Support
PR Newswire
PHOENIX, July 12, 2017

PHOENIX, July 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: ALPP), a technology and manufacturing holding company announced today that its subsidiary ALTIA has successfully concluded its 90 day pilot with Phoenix, AZ-based Earnhardt Auto Centers of its innovative 6th Sense Auto product platform. The pilot program was installed at the Earnhardt Chevrolet dealership in Chandler, AZ and performed well above expectations and will continue on in the store for the foreseeable future.  ALTIA is also in negotiations with several other large automotive groups regarding its 6th Sense Auto and BrakeActive aftermarket products and anticipates larger orders in late Q3 and Q4 2017.
6th Sense Auto is designed for the modern "connected car" and dedicated to helping large dealerships like Earnhardt improve their inventory management, engine diagnostics, service maintenance and personalized customer support through wireless, cloud-based software. 
Charlie Winters, Chairman of the Board and Alpine 4's Automotive Advisor had this to say: "The pilot program did not disappoint.  Our 6th Sense Auto product concluded with a 53% sell through rate in June on retail deals to the Earnhardt Chevrolet customer base and is expected to generate a steady stream of recurrent revenue for ALTIA and should expand when more dealership groups are signed on." 
With roughly 40 million new and used cars sold in the United States annually, ALTIA's market opportunity is very large and we believe that our 6th Sense Auto product is positioned to be a dominant player in this industry, noted Kent B. Wilson CEO of Alpine 4 Technologies.
About Earnhardt Auto Centers
Since 1951, the Earnhardt family has been selling cars and trucks to people across the southwest United States. The company was founded by Tex Earnhardt who, at the age of 21, became the youngest Ford franchise owner in the U.S. Today, the Earnhardt family continues to own and operate the 23 dealerships and personally oversees their operations.
