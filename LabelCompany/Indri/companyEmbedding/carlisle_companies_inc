History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s.
With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company.
The end of the depression and the beginning of World War II forced changes upon the rubber industry. Japan cut off 95% of the natural rubber supply from the East Indies, forcing Carlisle, along with other companies, to seek other sources. In December 1945, Carlisle began to manufacture inner tubes using synthetic rubber.
Carlisle Tire and Rubber was purchased by Pharis Tire and Rubber Company in 1943 for $330,000. But significant losses followed and in 1949, the Board of Directors decided to liquidate the company. All Carlisle stock was distributed to the Pharis stockholders and the company was officially renamed Carlisle Corporation. In 1946, Carlisle purchased a company that produced molded friction products that are used on traditional brake shoes and thus began the starting point of what today is Carlisle Brake & Friction. This also ushered in a new phase for Carlisle as they began growing as a diversified manufacturing company.
Later developments[edit]
During the 1950s and 1960s, Carlisle continued to acquire a variety of other companies further diversifying their product mix to include insulated wire and cable, which today is known as Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Incorporated became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of "CSL." By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products.
In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials. In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products.
So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, was the formed what today is known as Carlisle Transportation Products.

So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, was the formed what today is known as Carlisle Transportation Products.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s.
With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company.
The end of the depression and the beginning of World War II forced changes upon the rubber industry. Japan cut off 95% of the natural rubber supply from the East Indies, forcing Carlisle, along with other companies, to seek other sources. In December 1945, Carlisle began to manufacture inner tubes using synthetic rubber.
Carlisle Tire and Rubber was purchased by Pharis Tire and Rubber Company in 1943 for $330,000. But significant losses followed and in 1949, the Board of Directors decided to liquidate the company. All Carlisle stock was distributed to the Pharis stockholders and the company was officially renamed Carlisle Corporation. In 1946, Carlisle purchased a company that produced molded friction products that are used on traditional brake shoes and thus began the starting point of what today is Carlisle Brake & Friction. This also ushered in a new phase for Carlisle as they began growing as a diversified manufacturing company.
Later developments[edit]
During the 1950s and 1960s, Carlisle continued to acquire a variety of other companies further diversifying their product mix to include insulated wire and cable, which today is known as Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Incorporated became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of "CSL." By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products.
In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials. In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products.
So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, was the formed what today is known as Carlisle Transportation Products.

How do you choose lawn tires for your machine with so many choices? The first place to start is by looking at the tires currently on your machine. What size and ply are currently installed? You should replace with the same size and ply whenever possible.  Remember that in order to mow evenly, your machine needs to be level. Replacing the tire on one side of your machine with a different size and/or style is going to cause problems.
The best place to start your search is by using our lawn tire size search selector at the top of this page. Search for the size on your machine, and then decide which lawn tire is best for you based upon traction, ply, and price.

Smooth Lawn Tires - Minimum Turf DamageThese smooth lawn tires have been specially designed to cause minimum turf damage on lawns, golf greens, and fairways. 
Smooth tires are designed with wide surface weight distribution for increased steering and traction. Many mower decks use smooth tread tires to prevent undue compaction of the grass prior to impact with the mower blades. 
Smooth tires are used many times for front casters on zero turn or ZTR mowers leaving no trace of their path while making sharp turns.

Garden Tractor Tires / Heavy Duty Lug tiresThe garden tractor tires displayed here are used for additional traction and wet terrain. Lug tires are not the best for turf, but in the case of severe terrain and wet turf where additional traction is needed.
These Lug tires work well on the rear of Garden Tractors, but are not recommended on zero turn mowers.

Garden Tractor Tire ChainsGarden tractor chains are designed to give extra grip in mud, snow and ice. If you use your lawn or garden tractor for moving snow, you need a pair of garden tractor tire chains. 
Our garden tractor tire chains are constructed of durable hardened steel and made to last.
Our tractor chains come in 2 link and 4 link cross chain spacing. What does this mean? 2 Link spacing means that there is a cross chain going across your garden tractor tire every 2 side chain links. Conversely, 4 link chains have a cross chain every 4 side chain links.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s.
With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company.
The end of the depression and the beginning of World War II forced changes upon the rubber industry. Japan cut off 95% of the natural rubber supply from the East Indies, forcing Carlisle, along with other companies, to seek other sources. In December 1945, Carlisle began to manufacture inner tubes using synthetic rubber.
Carlisle Tire and Rubber was purchased by Pharis Tire and Rubber Company in 1943 for $330,000. But significant losses followed and in 1949, the Board of Directors decided to liquidate the company. All Carlisle stock was distributed to the Pharis stockholders and the company was officially renamed Carlisle Corporation. In 1946, Carlisle purchased a company that produced molded friction products that are used on traditional brake shoes and thus began the starting point of what today is Carlisle Brake & Friction. This also ushered in a new phase for Carlisle as they began growing as a diversified manufacturing company.
Later developments[edit]
During the 1950s and 1960s, Carlisle continued to acquire a variety of other companies further diversifying their product mix to include insulated wire and cable, which today is known as Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Incorporated became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of "CSL." By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products.
In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials. In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products.
So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, was the formed what today is known as Carlisle Transportation Products.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s.
With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company.

On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Incorporated became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of "CSL." By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products.
In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials. In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products.
So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, was the formed what today is known as Carlisle Transportation Products.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
