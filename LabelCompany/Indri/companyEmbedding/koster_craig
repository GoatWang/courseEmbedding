                        Craig Koster did a superb job! I was very impressed with his interpersonal skills and anticipate that you are grooming Craig for some supervisory position. Great job Craig! Finally the home of our dreams!
                    

                            Scott P. –  BELLEVUE, NE | Sep. 2015
                    



                        Craig Koster is absolutely phenomenal. He is the single reason we pursued a loan with Guaranteed Rate. Again, deep gratitude and appreciation to Craig for his work.

                    

                            Richard E. – Sandy, UT | Feb. 2015
                    



                        Craig was awesome! He always went the extra mile with additional calculations to answer any questions that I had!
                    

                            Jason B. -- 8/27/2014
                    



                        Craig helped us finance a recent home purchase. He was incredibly helpful, and prompt in his service all the way through the long, sometimes complicated, process. My family and I really appreciate all the work Craig did on our behalf - his service was second to none. I would (and will) gladly recommend Craig to family & friends in need of a mortgage solution.

 About Craig


I became a licensed loan officer in 2001 and have been in the business ever since. I love my job. Saving people money every day and helping them reach their dreams is a delight!

                        The mortgage process: A visual aid 









                        3 ways our technology makes your life easier

Craig interview Q&A



                    How long have you been in the mortgage business and what inspired you to get into it?
                

                    A friend introduced the mortgage business to me in 2001 and I have remained ever since.
                

                    Who is your typical customer and what questions do they typically have?
                

                    Being in mortgages so long helps me to know there is no such thing as typical. Every borrower is different and their is no one size fits all in this. But they all want to know how to get a lower rate, lower fees, and a lower monthly payment. Those are answers I have.
                

                    What specific steps do you use to help your customers find the best home loan for them?
                

                    The online application gets us started but overlaying their application on top of their goals allows me to select a strategy that is individual to the client's needs and wants.
                

                    How long have you been in the mortgage business? What awards have you won?
                

                    I have been in the mortgage business for over 15 years and in that time I have received production awards and service awards, but my favorite award is a happy client. All other awards pale.
                

                    What are the pros and cons of a fixed rate mortgage versus an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM)?
                

                    They are both vehicles that yield specific outcomes. Your home is a large part of your financial portfolio and its debt instrument should be used in alignment with your financial objectives.
                

                    Tell us about a specific challenging borrowing situation and how you got the mortgage closed and funded.
                

                    Borrowers decided to take out a payday loan a couple weeks before closing. It created a very messy situation. By knowing the guidelines and loan programs I was able to switch loan programs to help it all make sense to underwriting. Lots of steps. Lots of time. Lots of love needed on that loan.
                

                    What advice would you give new or first time home buyers?
                

                    Very few people ever stay in their first home. Be prepared to give up some things on your want list for characteristics that make better "investment" sense. A great Realtor and loan officer can advise in your best interest.
                

                    Tell us about a mortgage product that consumers may not be aware of?
                

                    Down payment assistance programs. I know them all. One in particular lends 30% of the purchase price for families with disabilities. Outstanding!
                

                    How has the mortgage industry changed since you started, and what would you expect in the future?
                

                    Guidelines are constantly loosening and restricting to match default rates. I don't expect a complete return of stated income loans to the degree they once existed, but as our economy experiences future success consumer appetites will increase and investors will once again see potential profit with riskier loans. The past will repeat itself and guidelines will loosen again allowing for a return of a "subprime" market of sorts.
                

                    What can borrowers do to insure a smooth mortgage underwriting process?
                

                    World, national, and local economies have felt significant fiscal pains due to a lack of sufficient checks and balances. To rectify this in mortgage lending, the underwriting process has become extremely document heavy. It goes a long way to know that the amount of documentation required is the same for everybody. This is likely to get worse before it ever gets better. Providing everything that is requested as quickly as possible is the number one thing a borrower can do to insure a smooth transaction.
                

                    What do you enjoy doing most in your spare time when you are not helping people with their home loans?
                

                    I got married three years ago and having a family has been more rewarding than I could ever have imagined. My time off is spent with family and I wouldn't have it any other way.
                

                    Tell us something that makes you unique or something wacky, yet interesting about you?
                

                    Running marathons in short shorts is a little slice of heaven. Love it.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Product Description▼▲
In this landmark commentary, Craig R. Koester offers a comprehensive look at a powerful and controversial early Christian text, the book of Revelation. The author provides richly textured descriptions of the book's setting and language, making extensive use of Greek and Latin inscriptions, classical texts, and ancient Jewish writings, including the Dead Sea Scrolls. Rather than viewing Revelation as world-negating, Koester focuses on its deep engagement with social, religious, and economic issues while addressing the book's volatile history of interpretation. The result is a groundbreaking study that provides bold new insights and sets new directions for the continued appreciation of this text.
