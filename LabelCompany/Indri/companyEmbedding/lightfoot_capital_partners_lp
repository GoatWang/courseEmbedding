Lightfoot Capital Partners, LP Teams up With GE To Own Liquefied 
      Natural Gas Assets in Pascagoula, Mississippi






October 24, 2011 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lightfoot Capital Partners, LP is pleased to announce that it has teamed 
      up with GE Energy Financial Services, a unit of GE (NYSE: GE), to make a 
      strategic investment in the liquefied natural gas market.
    


      Lightfoot Capital will make a direct investment and own a 48 percent 
      interest in Arc LNG Holdings LLC, which will own a 20 percent interest 
      in Gulf LNG Energy’s terminal in Pascagoula, Mississippi. GE Energy 
      Financial Services, directly and indirectly, controls its 50 percent 
      stake in Gulf LNG while a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation controls the 
      other 50 percent and is the operator.
    

      In a related transaction, GE Energy Financial Services acquired a 
      general partnership interest and a 58 percent limited partnership 
      interest in Lightfoot Capital from certain of its existing investors. 
      Lightfoot Capital is the general partner and majority owner of Arc 
      Terminals LP, a leading independent operator of petroleum and refined 
      product terminals. Arc Terminals operates petroleum product terminals in 
      eight states, with an aggregate storage capacity of 3.6 million barrels.
    

      “Our partnership with GE and investment in Gulf LNG Energy underscore 
      our desire to make strategic investments in the U.S. energy logistics 
      and infrastructure sector,” said Vince Cubbage, CEO of Lightfoot 
      Capital. “We feel strongly that GE’s financial backing and expertise 
      within the energy sector will allow us to accelerate our growth strategy 
      within our existing markets as well as related energy logistics asset 
      classes.”
    

      “Our investment in Lightfoot Capital reflects our strategy of working 
      with experienced management in areas we know well and pursuing growth 
      platforms in critical US energy infrastructure,” said Dan Castagnola, a 
      Managing Director at GE Energy Financial Services in Houston.

GE Energy Financial Services is also involved in oil and gas production, from partnerships that own reserves to production platforms.

Arc Logistics Partners LP, an limited partnership formed
  by Lightfoot Capital to own and operate energy logistics assets,
  filed on Wednesday with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an
  initial public offering. The New York, NY-based company, which
  was founded in 2013 and booked $34 million in sales for the 12
  months ended June 30, 2013, plans to list on the NYSE under the
  symbol ARCX. Arc Logistics Partners LP initially filed
  confidentially on August 12, 2013. Citi and Barclays are the
  joint bookrunners on the deal. No pricing terms were
  disclosed.

GE Expands Critical US Energy Infrastructure Investment Portfolio by Acquiring Majority Stake in Petroleum Products Storage Operator









TEXAS, US, Oct 24, 2011 — 
GE Energy Financial Services, a unit of GE (NYSE: GE), is deploying its capital in critical US infrastructure and expanding into petroleum product terminals by investing $85 million to become a majority owner of Lightfoot Capital Partners, LP ("Lightfoot Capital").
GE Energy Financial Services purchased a 58 percent interest in New York–based Lightfoot Capital from an investment vehicle managed by an affiliate of Magnetar Capital ("Magnetar Capital"). Lightfoot Capital, in turn, is the majority–owner of Arc Terminals, which operates petroleum product terminals in eight states.
"Our investment in Lightfoot Capital reflects our strategy of pursuing growth platforms in critical US energy infrastructure, working with experienced management in areas we know well," said Dan Castagnola, a managing director at GE Energy Financial Services in Houston. "We are deploying our capital, expertise and potentially some additional assets to support Lightfoot Capital's transition into a successful Master Limited Partnership."
GE Energy Financial Services already holds an interest in a Master Limited Partnership, Regency Energy Partners, LP (NASDAQ: RGP), a midstream natural gas services provider. By investing in Lightfoot Capital, GE Energy Financial Services is expanding beyond midstream to petroleum product terminals, diversified across regions, sites, customers and products.
"GE Energy Financial Services' acquisition of a majority interest in Lightfoot Capital significantly expands our ability to both source and complete attractive acquisitions, and accelerates our growth strategy," said Vince Cubbage, the CEO of Lightfoot Capital.
In addition to GE, Lightfoot Capital's investors are Atlas Energy, LP (NYSE: ATLS), Magnetar Capital, Tortoise Capital Resources Corp. (NYSE: TTO) and Triangle Peak Partners Private Equity, LP, as well as funds and accounts under management by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC.
GE Energy Financial Services' current midstream equity and debt portfolio totals approximately $2.4 billion. It has invested in gas storage assets, a LNG regasification terminal and 40,000 miles of gas pipelines. GE Energy Financial Services is also involved in oil and gas production, from partnerships that own reserves to production platforms.
About GE
GE (NYSE: GE) is an advanced technology, services and finance company taking on the world's toughest challenges. Dedicated to innovation in energy, health, transportation and infrastructure, GE operates in more than 100 countries and employs about 300,000 people worldwide. For more information, visit the company's Web site at www.ge.com.

Lightfoot Capital forms partnerships with and provides growth capital, extensive financial and industry relationships, and significant M&A expertise to high–potential private companies. For more information, please visit www.lightfootcapital.com.
About Arc Terminals LP
Arc Terminals LP is an independent terminal company with approximately 3.6 million barrels of storage that receives and distributes petroleum liquid products throughout the United States via marine, pipeline, rail and truck.
