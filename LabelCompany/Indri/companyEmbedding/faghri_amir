                           Heat and mass transfer can be encountered in many applications ranging from design and optimization of traditional engineering
                              systems, such as heat exchangers, turbine, electronic cooling, heat pipes, and food processing equipment, to emerging technologies
                              in sustainable energy, biological systems, security, information technology and nanotechnology. The purpose of this textbook
                              is to present the subject of heat and mass transfer with a focus on the significant advances in the field in the last decade,
                              while emphasizing the basic, fundamental principles. It provides advanced, relevant materials in heat and mass transfer in
                              a single volume for undergraduate senior and graduate students instead of relying upon several books. Engineering students
                              in a wide variety of engineering disciplines - from mechanical and chemical to biomedical and materials engineering - must
                              master the principles of heat and mass transfer as an essential tool in analyzing and designing any system or systems wherein

                              The objective of this report is to examine the performance characteristics of heat pipes and phase-change materials with multiple
                                 localized heat sources as well as the fundamental problems related to their specific applications. A numerical analysis is
                                 presented for the overall performance of heat pipes with single or multiple heat sources. The analysis includes the heat conduction
                                 in the wall and liquid-wick regions as well as the compressibility effect of the vapor flow inside the heat pipe. The solutions
                                 are compared with existing experimental data for the vapor and wall temperatures at both low and high temperatures. In addition,
                                 the performance of heat pipes with localized heat input including the effects of axial and circumferential heat conduction
                                 under high and low working temperatures was investigated. The numerical results for block heating a heat pipe with low working
                                 temperatures indicate a good agreement with existing experimental data

                              Detailed analysis and experimental data presented in this report show that longitudinal groove designs are crucial to increase
                                 the heat transport capacity of miniature heat pipes. The steady state mathematical models of a miniature axially grooved heat
                                 pipe with micro grooves are developed where the importance of the interfacial phenomena at the surfaces of the ultra thin
                                 is emphasized. The predicted capillary and boiling limitations as well as thermal resistance are compared to detailed in-house
                                 experimental data on miniature and conventional axially grooved heat pipes. It is found that flat miniature heat pipes are
                                 easily capable of withstanding heat fluxes on the order of 100 W/sq cm at the evaporator wall. Advanced flat miniature heat
                                 pipes are suggested and modeled to further increase the maximum heat flux at the evaporator wall. Additional experiments carried
                                 out for the heat pipe evaporators with forced convection and heat fluxes in excess of 200 W/sq cm proved that capillary limitation
                                 is the limiting one for flat miniature heat pipes with micro grooves

                              A modified tube and shell heat exchanger is comprised of a tube of heat sink material having micro heat pipes extending outward
                                 into the volume between the tube and shell to enable the rapid and efficient transfer and storage of thermal energy into the
                                 heat sink from a liquid or gas circulated through the volume. Several embodiments of the invention include modifications to
                                 the heat pipes. An alternative embodiment reverses the location of the heat sink to fill the volume between the shell and

Faghri is the author of four books and has published more than 300 archival technical publications, including 200 journal papers.[1][3][5] He holds eight U.S. patents related to heat pipes, energy storage devices, and fuel cells.[1][2] Faghri serves on the editorial boards of eight scientific journals, including the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, the International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Heat Transfer Engineering, Frontiers in Heat and Mass transfer, and Frontiers in Heat Pipes in roles such as executive editor, editor-in-chief, founding editor, and honorary editorial board member.[1][4] In the 1980s, he unraveled complex thermal problems, including convection in the presence of phase-change materials for thermal energy storage in space.[1][3] This breakthrough led to a more rational design of cooling systems for NASA and the U.S. Air Force. In the 1990s, he developed high heat flux miniature heat pipes for commercial cooling of laptop computer chips, which have been a principal contributor to the ubiquitous presence of heat pipes for cooling microprocessors in present-day laptop computers.[1][3]
Career[edit]
Amir Faghri started his academic career at Aryamehr University (now Sharif University of Technology) in 1976. He was one of the founding faculty members and administrators who established Isfahan University of Technology in 1977. He served on the faculty of IUT until 1980 as the founding director of its Energy Division (now separated into the Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments). In 1981, he joined the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor to teach thermal and energy courses.[1] Following Berkeley, Faghri joined the faculty of Wright State University in 1982 and was promoted to Brage Golding Distinguished Professor in 1989. He developed a nationally-recognized heat transfer group and laboratory at WSU, interacting extensively with NASA and the U.S. Air Force.[1]
Faghri joined the University of Connecticut in 1994 and served as Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department from 1994â1998, United Technologies Corporation Chair Professor in Thermal-Fluids Engineering from 2004â2010, and Dean of the School of Engineering from 1998â2006.[1][4] During his tenure as Dean, he attracted corporate and alumni support to establish 17 endowed professorships, including 11 chair professorships. He increased total enrollment by 106%, increased the number of merit scholarships by approximately 200%, and added three new buildings/facilities. He also doubled the number of undergraduate degree programs from 6 to 12. Faghri was the founder of the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center (renamed later as the Center for Clean Energy Engineering) at the University of Connecticut.[1][3]
Honors and Awards[edit]
Amir Faghri has received many national and international honors and awards, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Thermophysics Award in 1998,[6] the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Heat Transfer Memorial Award in 1998,[7] the ASME James Harry Potter Gold Medal in 2005,[8] and the ASME/AIChE Max Jakob Memorial Award in 2010, which is considered the highest honor in the field of heat transfer.[3][9] Faghri has been a longtime fellow of the ASME and an elected member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering. He was also inducted to the Oregon State University Council of Distinguished Engineers in 1999.[10]
Books[edit]
Faghri has authored four books:

Faghri, A., Zhang, Y., and Howell, J. R. (2010). Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer. Global Digital Press, Columbia, MO. ISBN 978-0-9842760-0-4
Faghri, A., and Zhang, Y. (2006). Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems. Elsevier Academic Press. ISBN 978-0-12-370610-2

Faghri, A. (1991). Thermal Science Measurements. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. ISBN 978-0-8403-6802-7

His signature work, Heat Pipe Science and Technology, ranks as the most widely cited book on the subject of heat pipes by Google Scholar. His textbook, Transport Phenomena in Multiphase Systems, presented, for the first time, a unified fundamental treatise on all three forms of phase change â boiling and evaporation, melting and solidification, and sublimation and vapor deposition. His latest textbook, Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer, covers the subject of heat and mass transfer with a focus on the recent advances in the field.

Amir Faghri is an American professor and leader in the engineering profession as an educator, scientist, and administrator.[1][2][3] He is currently Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Distinguished Dean Emeritus at the University of Connecticut. Faghri served as Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department from 1994â1998, and Dean of the School of Engineering at the University of Connecticut from 1998â2006.[4] Faghri is well known for his contributions to the field of heat transfer. He is arguably the worldâs leading expert in the area of heat pipes and a significant contributor to thermal-fluids engineering in thermal energy systems.[1][3]

Education[edit]
Amir Faghri received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1974 and 1976, respectively. He received his B.S. degree from Oregon State University with highest honors in 1973.[1][3][4]
Technical Contributions[edit]
Faghri is the author of four books and has published more than 300 archival technical publications, including 200 journal papers.[1][3][5] He holds eight U.S. patents related to heat pipes, energy storage devices, and fuel cells.[1][2] Faghri serves on the editorial boards of eight scientific journals, including the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, the International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Heat Transfer Engineering, Frontiers in Heat and Mass transfer, and Frontiers in Heat Pipes in roles such as executive editor, editor-in-chief, founding editor, and honorary editorial board member.[1][4] In the 1980s, he unraveled complex thermal problems, including convection in the presence of phase-change materials for thermal energy storage in space.[1][3] This breakthrough led to a more rational design of cooling systems for NASA and the U.S. Air Force. In the 1990s, he developed high heat flux miniature heat pipes for commercial cooling of laptop computer chips, which have been a principal contributor to the ubiquitous presence of heat pipes for cooling microprocessors in present-day laptop computers.[1][3]
Career[edit]
Amir Faghri started his academic career at Aryamehr University (now Sharif University of Technology) in 1976. He was one of the founding faculty members and administrators who established Isfahan University of Technology in 1977. He served on the faculty of IUT until 1980 as the founding director of its Energy Division (now separated into the Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering Departments). In 1981, he joined the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting professor to teach thermal and energy courses.[1] Following Berkeley, Faghri joined the faculty of Wright State University in 1982 and was promoted to Brage Golding Distinguished Professor in 1989. He developed a nationally-recognized heat transfer group and laboratory at WSU, interacting extensively with NASA and the U.S. Air Force.[1]
Faghri joined the University of Connecticut in 1994 and served as Head of the Mechanical Engineering Department from 1994â1998, United Technologies Corporation Chair Professor in Thermal-Fluids Engineering from 2004â2010, and Dean of the School of Engineering from 1998â2006.[1][4] During his tenure as Dean, he attracted corporate and alumni support to establish 17 endowed professorships, including 11 chair professorships. He increased total enrollment by 106%, increased the number of merit scholarships by approximately 200%, and added three new buildings/facilities. He also doubled the number of undergraduate degree programs from 6 to 12. Faghri was the founder of the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center (renamed later as the Center for Clean Energy Engineering) at the University of Connecticut.[1][3]
Honors and Awards[edit]
Amir Faghri has received many national and international honors and awards, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Thermophysics Award in 1998,[6] the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Heat Transfer Memorial Award in 1998,[7] the ASME James Harry Potter Gold Medal in 2005,[8] and the ASME/AIChE Max Jakob Memorial Award in 2010, which is considered the highest honor in the field of heat transfer.[3][9] Faghri has been a longtime fellow of the ASME and an elected member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering. He was also inducted to the Oregon State University Council of Distinguished Engineers in 1999.[10]

Description


Engineering students in a wide variety of engineering disciplines from mechanical and chemical to biomedical and materials engineering must master the principles of transport phenomena as an essential tool in analyzing and designing any system or systems wherein momentum, heat and mass are transferred. This textbook was developed to address that need, with a clear presentation of the fundamentals, ample problem sets to reinforce that knowledge, and tangible examples of how this knowledge is put to use in engineering design.  Professional engineers, too, will find this book invaluable as reference for everything from heat exchanger design to chemical processing system design and more.




Key Features



Develops an understanding of the thermal and physical behavior of multiphase systems with phase change, including microscale and porosity, for practical applications in heat transfer, bioengineering, materials science, nuclear engineering, environmental engineering, process engineering, biotechnology and nanotechnology

Brings all three forms of phase change, i.e., liquid <--> vapor, solid <--> liquid and solid <--> vapor, into one volume and describes them from one perspective in the context of fundamental treatment 

Presents the generalized integral and differential transport phenomena equations for multi-component multiphase systems in local instance as well as averaging formulations. The molecular approach is also discussed with the connection between microscopic and molecular approaches

Presents basic principles of analyzing transport phenomena in multiphase systems with emphasis on melting, solidification, sublimation, vapor deposition, condensation, evaporation, boiling and two-phase flow heat transfer at the micro and macro levels

Solid/liquid/vapor interfacial phenomena, including the concepts of surface tension, wetting phenomena, disjoining pressure, contact angle, thin films and capillary phenomena, including interfacial balances for mass, species, momentum, and energy for multi-component and multiphase interfaces are discussed

Ample examples and end-of-chapter problems, with Solutions Manual and PowerPoint presentation available to the instructors






Readership


Senior undergraduate/graduate students in mechanical, chemical, and materials engineering; students in physical and life sciences taking courses in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and transport phenomena




Table of Contents

Contents:  Introduction to Transport Phenomena; Thermodynamics of Multiphase Systems;  Generalized Governing Equations: Local Instance Formulations; Generalized Governing Equations; Averaging Formulations; Solid-Liquid-Vapor Phenomena and Interfacial Heat and Mass Transfer; Melting and Solidification; Sublimation and Vapor Deposition; Condensation; Evaporation; Boiling; Two-Phase Flow and Heat Transfer; 1064 pages, 403 figures, 292 problems and 62 examples.
