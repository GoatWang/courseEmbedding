(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We meet the conditions set forth in General Instruction (I)(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K and have omitted specific information called for by this Item pursuant to General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. OpCo GP is a subsidiary of CPG formed in Delaware on December 5, 2007. Through the registration of CPG's senior notes, OpCo GP, as a guarantor of the notes, must comply with the reporting requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. OpCo GP has not had any assets, liabilities, operations or cash flows since its formation date. The formation transactions that occurred as part of the initial public offering of CPPL resulted in OpCo GP becoming the general partner of Columbia OpCo. Columbia OpCo owns substantially all of CPG's natural gas transmission and storage assets. CPPL owns a 15.7% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The remaining 84.3% limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo is owned by CEG, a 100% owned subsidiary of CPG. On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), among CPG, TransCanada PipeLines Limited, a Canadian corporation ("Parent"), TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("US Parent"), Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ("Merger Sub"), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada Corporation, a Canadian corporation and the direct parent company of Parent ("TransCanada"). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the "Merger") with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect the ownership of OpCo GP, but OpCo GP is indirectly managed by TransCanada after the Merger. CPPL Merger: On November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CPG ("Pony Merger Sub") and MLP GP. The conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the "GP Conflicts Committee") and the board of directors of the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP (collectively, the "CPPL unaffiliated unitholders"). The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the GP Board approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions at the special meeting of the unitholders. On February 16, 2017, the CPPL common unitholders voted to approve the CPPL Merger. The transaction closed on February 17, 2017 and as of that date CPPL became a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG. The CPPL Merger did not affect the ownership of OpCo GP. Consolidation of Columbia OpCo Under ASC 810, Columbia OpCo is determined to be a VIE. Additionally, it is determined that OpCo GP is not the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo because OpCo GP lacks a direct economic interest in Columbia OpCo and the various related party LP interest holders were determined not to be so closely associated that they should be aggregated. As CPPL has a significant economic interest in Columbia OpCo and has the power to direct the activities of Columbia OpCo through that interest and its  Table of Contents CPG OpCo GP LLC  ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)  100% ownership interest in OpCo GP, CPPL is determined to be the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo and consolidates Columbia OpCo in its financial statements.

1.    Basis
of Accounting Presentation

CPG OpCo
GP LLC ("OpCo GP") is a subsidiary of CPG formed in Delaware on
December 5, 2007. Through the registration of CPG's senior notes,
OpCo GP, as a guarantor of the notes, must comply with the
reporting requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. OpCo GP has
not had any assets, liabilities, operations or cash flows since its
formation date.

The
formation transactions that occurred as part of the initial public
offering of CPPL resulted in OpCo GP becoming the general partner
of Columbia OpCo. Columbia OpCo owns substantially all of CPG's
natural gas transmission and storage assets. CPPL owns a 15.7%
limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The remaining 84.3%
limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo is owned by CEG, a 100%
owned sub sidiary of CPG.

Consolidation
of Columbia OpCo

Under ASC
810, Columbia OpCo is determined to be a VIE. Additionally, it is
determined that OpCo GP is not the primary beneficiary of Columbia
OpCo because OpCo GP lacks a direct economic interest in Columbia
OpCo and the various related party limited partner interest holders
were determined not to be so closely associated that they should be
aggregated. As CPPL has a significant economic interest in Columbia
OpCo and has the power to direct the activities of Columbia OpCo
through that interest and it s 100% ownership interest in OpCo GP,
CPPL is determined to be the primary beneficiary of Columbia OpCo
and consolidates Columbia OpCo in its financial
statements.

Guarantees
of Debt. OpCo GP
and Columbia OpCo (together with CEG, the "Guarantors") have
guaranteed payment of $2,750.0 million in aggregated principal
amount of CPG's senior notes. Each Guarantor is required to comply
with covenants under the debt indenture and in the event of default
the Guarantors would be obligated to pay the debt's principal and
related interest. OpCo GP does not anticipate that any of the
Guarantors will have any difficulty maintaining compliance. The
guarantees of any Guarantor may be released under certain
circumstances.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CPG OpCo
GP LLC

 

Executive
Overview

OpCo GP
is a subsidiary of CPG formed in Delaware on December 5, 2007.
Through the registration of CPG's senior notes, OpCo GP, as a
guarantor of the notes, must comply with the reporting requirements
of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. OpCo GP has not had any assets,
liabilities, operations or cash flows since its formation
date.

The
formation transactions that occurred as part of the initial public
offering of CPPL resulted in OpCo GP becoming the general partner
of Columbia OpCo. Columbia OpCo owns substantially all of CPG's
natural gas transmission and storage assets. CPPL owns a 15.7%
limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo. The remaining 84.3%
limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo is owned by CEG, a 100%
owned subsidiary of CPG.

On March
17, 2016, CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”), among CPG, TransCanada PipeLines
Limited, a Canadian corporation (“Parent”), TransCanada
PipeLine USA Ltd., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“US Parent”), Taurus Merger Sub
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US
Parent (“Merger Sub”), and, solely for purposes of
Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement, TransCanada Corporation, a Canadian corporation
and the direct parent company of Parent
(“TransCanada”). Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1,
2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the
“Merger”) with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect
the ownership of OpCo GP, but OpCo GP is indirectly managed by
TransCanada after the Merger.

Proposed
Merger of CPPL by CPG: On
November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it had entered into an
agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of
CPG (“Pony Merger Sub”) and MLP GP.

The
conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the
“GP Conflicts Committee”) and the board of directors of
the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined
that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and
reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders
of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP
(collectively, the “CPPL unaffiliated unitholders”).
The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the the GP Board approve the
merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved
that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted
to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders
for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL
vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and
the merger transactions at the special meeting of the
unitholders.

CPG
indirectly owns, through its ownership of CEG, 100% of the
membership interests in MLP GP. CEG owns all of the subordinated
units (“CPPL subordinated units”) representing a 46.5%
limited partner interest in CPPL. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
Pony Merger Sub will merge with and into CPPL at the effective time
of the merger, with CPPL surviving, such that following the merger,
MLP GP will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG and the sole
general partner of CPPL, and CPG and CEG will be the only limited
partners of CPPL. Each CPPL common unit issued and outstanding as
of immediately prior to at the effective time of the merger will be
converted into the right to receive (i) $17.00 per CPPL common unit
in cash without any interest thereon plus (ii) an additional amount
of cash per CPPL common unit without any interest thereon equal to
the product of (x) the number of days from and including the first
day of the quarter in which the closing occurs through and
including the closing date multiplied by (y) $0.00217 per CPPL
common Unit (a daily distribution rate equal to the quotient of
$0.1975 divided by ninety-one (91)), plus (iii) an amount equal to
$0.1975 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon
if the record date for the CPPL’s quarterly cash distribution
with respect to the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in
which the closing occurs shall not have occurred prior to the
effective time of the merger (the "Merger Consideration").
Incentive distribution rights of CPPL, which are owned by CEG, will
be unchanged and remain outstanding as incentive distribution
rights of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be
delivered in respect thereof. CPPL subordinated units, which are
owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL
subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration
will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL
common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the
number of public common units being converted into the

	This Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 relates to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-209653) of Columbia
	Pipeline Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), Columbia Energy Group, a Delaware Corporation (CEG), CPG OpCo GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (OpCo GP) and CPG OpCo LP, a Delaware limited
	partnership (Columbia OpCo and together with CEG and OpCo GP, the additional registrant guarantors) filed on February 23, 2016 and amended by pre-effective Amendment No. 1 thereto on April 7, 2016 (as amended,
	the Registration Statement), which registered the Company and the additional registrant guarantors offer to exchange (the exchange offer) up to $500,000,000 principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2018, $750,000,000
	principal amount of 3.30% Senior Notes due 2020, $1,000,000,000 principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2025 and $500,000,000 principal amount of 5.80% Senior Notes due 2045, in each case which had been registered under the Securities Act of
	1933, as amended (the Act), for any and all of the Company and the additional registrant guarantors outstanding $500,000,000 principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2018, $750,000,000 principal amount of 3.30% Senior Notes due
	2020, $1,000,000,000 principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2025 and $500,000,000 principal amount of 5.80% Senior Notes due 2045, respectively, which had not been registered under the Act. The offer contemplated by the Registration Statement
	expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 12, 2016.

	As a consequence of the Merger, the Company has terminated all offerings of its securities under its existing registration statements under

	registrant guarantors 2.45% Senior Notes due 2018 not issued in the exchange offer, $100,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company and the additional registrant guarantors 3.30% Senior Notes due 2020, and $1,300,000 in aggregate

CPPL subordinated units, which are owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the number of public common units being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties anticipate that the merger will close in the first quarter of 2017 and that CPPL will pay the regular quarterly cash distributions to unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of $0.1975, with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly distribution to occur no later than 30 days and 42 days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter.  Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  Commercial Growth and Expansion   Gibraltar Pipeline Project. We expect to invest approximately $260 million to construct an approximately 1 MMDth/d dry gas header pipeline in southwest Pennsylvania. We expect this to be the first of multiple phases with an initial in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a final in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2017.   Utica Access Project. We invested approximately $50 million to construct 4.7 miles of 24-inch pipeline to provide 205,000 Dth/d of new firm transportation to provide Appalachian production access to liquid trading points on Columbia Gas Transmission's system. This project was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016.   Millennium Lateral. We intend to invest approximately $20 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to construct approximately 8 miles of 16-inch pipeline to a new power plant situated near Wawayanda, New York. This project will provide up to 127,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity and will be placed into service in the second quarter of 2017.   Leach XPress. This project will provide approximately 1.5 MMDth/d of capacity from the Marcellus and Utica production regions to the Leach compressor station located on the Columbia Gulf system, TCO Pool, and other markets on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $1.4 billion, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017.   Rayne XPress. This project will transport approximately 1 MMDth/d of southwest Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system from the Leach, Kentucky interconnect with Columbia Gas Transmission towards the Rayne compressor station in southern Louisiana to reach various Gulf Coast markets. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $420 million, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017.   Cameron Access Project. This project, which involves an investment of approximately $300 million, will provide 800,000 Dth/d of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf system to the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. We expect the project to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2018.   WB XPress. This project, which involves an investment of approximately $0.9 billion, will expand Columbia Gas Transmission's WB system in order to transport approximately 1.3 MMDth/d of Marcellus production to pipeline interconnects and East Coast markets, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Mountaineer XPress. This approximately $2.0 billion project will provide new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica production. The project will provide up to 2.7 MMDth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Gulf XPress. Gulf XPress will provide 860,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity for Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system. This project involves an investment of approximately $0.7 billion and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Central Virginia Connector. This project will provide 45,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system to a new point of delivery in Virginia. This approximately $13 million project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.   Millennium Eastern System Upgrade. We intend to invest approximately $135 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to expand eastward flow capacity by 223,000 Dth/d to Ramapo and other nearby points on the system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued) CPG OpCo LP  In 2013, the FERC approved the modernization settlement entered into by Columbia Gas Transmission and its customers that provides recovery and return on an investment of up to $1.5 billion over a five-year period to modernize its system to improve system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. The modernization program includes, among other things, replacement of aging pipeline and compressor facilities, enhancements to system inspection capabilities and improvements in control systems. Columbia Gas Transmission placed approximately $320 million in modernization investments into service during 2015. In January 2016, the FERC approved Columbia Gas Transmission's third annual filing for recovery of the revenue requirement under this program. In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional $1.1 billion over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. Items Affecting Comparability of our Financial Results The historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the following reasons:   Upon the closing of CPPL's IPO, short-term borrowings-affiliated and a portion of the long-term debt-affiliated (including current portion of long-term debt-affiliated) have been transferred to an affiliate of CPG and the related interest expense is no longer being incurred.   We are a limited partnership treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. We are subject to state and local income taxes in certain jurisdictions. The Predecessor's tax expense was determined on a separate return basis. Accordingly, we expect our tax expense to be significantly reduced subsequent to CPPL's IPO as compared to that of the Predecessor.   We incurred additional costs as a result of the Merger. We incurred $110.4 million of Merger related costs within operation and maintenance and property and other taxes, including employee related expenses of $101.3 million. Additionally we incurred a Merger related impairment charge of $11.9 million. These costs are included in "Operation and maintenance" and "Impairment of long-lived assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited).
