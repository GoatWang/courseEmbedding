He retired as the Chief Executive Officer for the Mid-Atlantic Banking Region at Wachovia Corporation in 2006, and previously served as President of Virginia Banking, Head of Trust and Investment Management, and in various positions in North Carolina banking including Regional Executive, Area Executive, City Executive, Corporate Banking and Loan Administration Manager, and Retail Banking Branch Manager for Wachovia.

Today, our team is better prepared than ever to address even the most complex financial challenges. We have expanded our capabilities across asset classes and financial markets, giving our clients broad access to an ever-changing world of financial opportunity.

Our role as an investment banking company is to support those relationships with value-added financial expertise, products and services. We are proud to be a local firm with a national presence.

We have staying power. With a strong capital base and a heritage of excellence that is more than 47 years strong, we know that financial stability and proven management expertise are prerequisites to serving our clients in good economic times and bad.

He has served as CEO and as a director of Park Sterling Corporation (NASDAQ: PSTB), a bank holding company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, since its formation in August 2010 and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Park Sterling Bank, a regional financial services company, since its initial public offering in August 2010. From 1974 until June 2006, Mr. Cherry served Wachovia Corporation and its principal Wachovia Bank in various leadership positions, including as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the Mid-Atlantic Banking Region at Wachovia Corporation, President of Virginia Banking, and Head of Trust and Investment Management.
