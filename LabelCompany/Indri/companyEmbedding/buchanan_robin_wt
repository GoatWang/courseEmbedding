BUCHANAN'S FAMILY















Buchanan's 12






                                                    A classic for more than 130 years, Buchanan’s DeLuxe is a 12-year old scotch whisky that has one of the world’s most iconic and awarded luxury Scotch whisky brands. 
                                                











Buchanan's Master






                                                    Winner of double gold medal in the 2014 World Spirits Competition in San Francisco, Buchanan’s Master is a blend of malts, at least one from every region in Scotland, hand-picked by our Master Blender: Keith Law.

                                                    Maximum expression of the House of Buchanan's. Its blend includes whiskies aged for at least 18 years in oak barrels that previously held sherry.
