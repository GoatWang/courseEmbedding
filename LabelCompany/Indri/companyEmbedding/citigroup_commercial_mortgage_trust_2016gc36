                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                    Global Credit Research - 15 Dec 2016
                







Approximately $857.7 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, December 15, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has 
affirmed the ratings on eight classes in Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
Trust 2016-GC36, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates as follows:

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Feb

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the seven P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class, Class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor 
or WARF) of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.8% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the December 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.3% to $1.152 
billion from $1.155 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 58 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 9.98% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans constituting 59.4% of the pool. There 
are no loans that have an investment-grade structured credit assessment 
or that have defeased.




Three loans, constituting 3.1% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




There are no loans that have liquidated from the pool or that are currently 
in special servicing.




Moody's received partial year 2016 operating results for 93% of 
the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 119.6%, 
compared to 119.7% at Moody's last review. 
Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit 
assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced 
and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects 
a weighted average haircut of 17% to the most recently available 
net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted 
average capitalization rate of 9.6%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.39X and 0.87X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 29% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the 5 Penn Plaza Loan ($115 million -- 
9.9% of the pool), which represents a pari passu portion 
of a $260 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by 
the borrower's fee simple interest in a 26-story, Class 
A- office building located on 8th Avenue between West 33rd and 
West 34th Streets in New York, NY. The building is LEED Gold 
Certified and measures 650,329 square feet (SF), of which 
17,180 square feet (SF) is comprised of ground floor retail space, 
and 11,198 square feet (SF) is comprised of miscellaneous non-revenue 
concourse and sub-concourse space. All remaining area is 
comprised of office space. As of November 1, 2015, 
the property was 97.2% leased to 31 office tenants and 2 
retail tenants. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 114.8% 
and 0.82X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is the Sheraton Denver Downtown Fee Loan ($110 
million -- 9.5% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of a $180 million mortgage loan. The 
non-controlling Note A-2, having a balance of $70,000,000 
was contributed to the CGCMT 2016-GC37 trust. The loan is 
secured by a leased fee interest associated with a 4.38-acre 
parcel of land located at 1550 Court Place in Denver, CO. 
The subject parcel generates revenue through a 99-year ground lease 
dated December 9, 2015. The non-collateral improvements 
are represented by the Sheraton Denver Downtown, a 1,231-key, 
full-service hotel that was constructed in 1959 and renovated in 
2008-2010. For the twelve months ending September 30, 
2015, the non-collateral hotel was operating at occupancy, 
ADR, and RevPAR of 77.0%, $153.02, 
and $117.76, respectively. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 115.9% and 0.63X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Austin Block 21 Loan ($108.7 
million -- 9.4% of the pool), which represents 
a pari passu portion of a $148.3 million mortgage loan. 
The non-controlling Note A-2 having a balance of $39.5 
million was contributed to the CGCMT 216-GC37 trust. The 
loan is secured by the borrower's fee simple interest in a 37-story, 
369,842 square foot (SF), mixed-use development located 
in Austin, TX. The Property is directly across the street 
from City Hall and attached to the ACL Live at the Moody Theatre. 
The Property consists of (i) a 251-room W Austin Hotel, (ii) 
a 2,750-seat, 86,757 square foot (SF), 
live music, entertainment and private event venue space and (iii) 
56,643 square foot (SF) of retail and office space. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 146.3% and 0.84X, 
respectively, compared to 147.9% and 0.83X 
at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 58 fixed rate mortgage loans secured 
by 104 mortgaged properties. The ratings are based on the collateral 
and the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.39x is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.31x, but lower than other conduit/fusion 
transactions rated by Moody's during 2015. The Moody's Stressed 
DSCR is 0.87x, which is lower than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92x.




The pooled Trust loan balance of $1.156 million represents 
a Moody's LTV ratio of 119.7%, which is higher 
than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% 
and higher than most pools securitized during 2015. There are two 
loans in the pool with subordinate debt, in the form of mezzanine 
debt. With the subordinate debt the Moody's total debt LTV ratio 
rises to 122.7%.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 0 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.15, which is better than 
the average score calculated for other rated by Moody's rated conduit 
pools since 2009.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 20.5. The transaction's 
loan level diversity profile is lower than the scores calculated for most 
multi-borrower pools that Moody's has rated since 2009. 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property level 
Herfindahl score is 21.3.




This deal is structured with super-senior Aaa (sf) classes having 
30% credit enhancement. Although the additional enhancement 
offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection 
against pool loss, the super-senior structure is credit negative 
for the carved out Class A-S certificate which immediately supports 
the super-senior classes. If the support certificate were 
to take a loss, the loss would have the potential to be quite large 
on a percentage basis relative to Moody's idealized Aaa (sf) loss 
target. Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability 
of default in recognition that their loss-given default is higher.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan 
that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance." 
Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
14.4%, and 23.5%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated Aaa (sf) classes would be Aaa, Aa2, 
and A1, respectively; for the currently rated Aa2 (sf) class, 
Aa3, A2 and Baa2, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities 
are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate 
over time; rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation 
of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in 
the initial rating process differed. The analysis assumes that 
the deal has not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the 
ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated 
standpoint. Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration 
in the ratings process, so the actual ratings that would be assigned 
in each case could vary from the information presented in the Parameter 
Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's and (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF426624.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

but excluding any DVD, CD-ROM, computer diskette or any other electronic media that may accompany the printed version thereof,

      the end of this ratings action commentary.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are slightly worse than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively, are 
      slightly worse than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages of 1.20x and 
      105.5%. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the conduit portion of the 
      pool (net of investment-grade credit-opinion loans) are 1.14x and 
      112.2%, respectively.


                                        








Diverse Pool: The 10 largest loans comprise 44.9% of the pool, which is 
      better than the YTD average of 54.5% for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals. The largest loan in the pool is 8 Times Square & 1460 Broadway at 
      8.21% of the pool. The respective loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) scores of 319 and 375 are better than 
      the YTD averages of 421 and 494 for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals.


                                        








Below-Average Amortization: Eleven loans comprising 42.3% of the pool 
      are full interest-only. This is worse than the average when compared to 
      other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 23.3% for 2015 and 32.1% 
      for YTD 2016. Additionally, there are 19 loans comprising 28.4% of the 
      pool which are partial interest-only, which is better than the 2015 and 
      YTD 2016 averages of 43.1% and 34.7%. Overall, the pool is scheduled to 
      pay down by 8.8% which is worse than average when compared with the 
      averages of 11.7% for 2015 and 10.5% YTD 2016 for other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      deals.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.32% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI), for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P6 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.


                                        








Fitch assigns ratings and Ratings Outlooks to the transaction as follows:

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided “as is” without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.


                                        








For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-C2; Presale Issued
























NEW YORK, Aug 08, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2016-C2 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.


                                        








Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:


                                        








--$20,227,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$15,097,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$170,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$189,298,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$31,793,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$456,873,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$68,531,000b class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$30,458,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$35,027,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$33,504,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$32,743,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$32,743,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$9,137,500ac class E-1 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$9,137,500ac class E-2 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$18,275,000ac class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$5,330,000ac class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$23,605,000ac class EF 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.


                                        








a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.


                                        








b) Notional amount and interest-only.


                                        








c) The class E-1 and E-2 certificates may be exchanged for a related 
      amount of class E certificates, and class E certificates may be 
      exchanged for a ratable portion of class E-1 and E-2 certificates. 
      Additionally, class E-1, E-2, F-1 and F-2 certificates may be exchanged 
      for a related amount of class EF certificates, and class EF certificates 
      may be exchanged for a ratable portion of each class of class E-1, E-2, 
      F-1 and F-2 certificates. A holder of class E-1, E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and 
      G-2 certificates may exchange such classes of certificates (on an 
      aggregate basis) for a related amount of class EFG certificates, and a 
      holder of class EFG certificates may exchange that class EFG for a 
      ratable portion of each class of the class E-1, E-2, F-1, F-2, G-1 and 
      G-2 certificates.


                                        








The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 4, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $2,665,000 class F-1, 
      $2,665,000 class F-2, $5,330,000 class G-1, $5,330,000 class G-2, 
      $10,660,000 exchangeable class G, $34,265,000 exchangeable class EFG, 
      $8,376,511 class H-1, $8,376,811 class H-2, or the $16,753,022 
      exchangeable class H certificates.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 44 loans secured by 53 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $609,165,022 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, MC-Five Mile 
      Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Walker & Dunlop Commercial Property 
      Funding I CB, LLC.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 81.9% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 86.5% of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.15x and 108.5%, 
      respectively. This is slightly worse than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 
      average Fitch DSCR of 1.16x and the YTD 2016 average Fitch LTV of 
      107.5%. Excluding the credit opinion loan (9.8% of the pool), the Fitch 
      DSCR and LTV are 1.10x and 111.3%, respectively.


                                        








Investment Grade Credit Opinion Loan Represents 9.8% of the Pool: One 
      loan, Vertex Pharmaceuticals HQ (9.8% of the pool) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.4% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-C2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.   Financing from $50,000 to $750,000 for purchase and refinance loans in first lien position; $50,000 to $500,000 for lines of credit, equity loans, and refinance loans in second lien position. Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.
