LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:GDEN) ("Golden Entertainment" or "the
      Company"), announced today that the Illinois Gaming Board has approved
      the Company's application for a video gaming terminal ("VGT") operator
      license. This action by the Illinois Gaming Board allows a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Golden Entertainment to operate VGTs in liquor licensed
      establishments, including bars, restaurants, truck stops and certain
      fraternal and veterans organizations. According to statistics provided
      by the Illinois Gaming Board, as of May 2017 there were over 26,000 VGTs
      operating in over 6,000 locations throughout the state.
    
Blake L. Sartini, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Golden
      Entertainment, commented, "We thank the Illinois Gaming Board for its
      consideration and approval of our license application and look forward
      to participating in the state's growing distributed gaming market. Given
      our significant experience and success in distributed gaming operations,
      including our position as the largest operator in Nevada and the second
      largest in Montana, we believe we can help current and new
      establishments that feature VGTs optimize their patrons' entertainment
      experience. Illinois is an important and growing market for distributed
      gaming where we are considering both organic and acquisition
      opportunities to establish our presence."
    

      The approval in Illinois marks the fourth state where Golden
      Entertainment is licensed. The Company is also licensed in Nevada,
      Montana and Maryland. In Nevada, Golden Entertainment is the state's
      largest operator of distributed gaming with more than 7,500 devices in
      nearly 700 locations. The Company is also Nevada's largest traditional
      tavern operator with 56 locations and operates three casinos in Pahrump.
      In Montana, Golden Entertainment has distributed gaming operations that
      cover nearly 2,900 devices in 290 locations. In Maryland, Golden
      Entertainment operates the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Western Maryland.
    

      On June 12, 2017Golden Entertainment announced that it entered into a
      definitive agreement to acquire American Casino & Entertainment
      Properties LLC, which owns three properties in Las Vegas including the
      Stratosphere Casino, Hotel & Tower, Arizona Charlie's Decatur and
      Arizona Charlie's Boulder, as well as the Aquarius Casino Resort in
      Laughlin, NV. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory
      approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.
    
About Golden Entertainment, Inc.

      two divisions - distributed gaming and resort and casino operations.

      four casino properties, more than 50 taverns and operates approximately

      forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks and
      uncertainties that may change at any time, and readers are therefore
      cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those
      expressed in any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause
      actual results to differ include, among other things: the Company's

      failure to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies and other
      benefits of the ACEP transaction; stockholder litigation in connection

      integrate ACEP's businesses, and other acquired businesses; changes in
      national, regional and local economic, political and market conditions;
      legislative and regulatory matters (including the cost of compliance or
      failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations); increases in
      gaming taxes and fees in the jurisdictions in which the Company
      operates; litigation; increased competition; the Company's ability to
      renew its distributed gaming contracts; reliance on key personnel
      (including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and
      Chief Strategy and Financial Officer); the level of the Company's
      indebtedness and the Company's ability to comply with covenants in its
      debt facilities; terrorist incidents; natural disasters; severe weather
      conditions; the effects of environmental and structural building
      conditions; the effects of disruptions to the Company's information
      technology and other systems and infrastructure; factors affecting the
      gaming, entertainment and hospitality industries generally; and other
      risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's filings with the SEC,
      including the "Risk Factors" section of the Company's Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company undertakes
      no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of
      new information, future developments or otherwise. All forward-looking

Stratosphere, Aquarius now BW Premier

				July 18, 2017 3:00 AM
				by
				Robert Mann 
Best Western Hotels & Resorts has announced that the Stratosphere Casino, Hotel and Tower and the Aquarius Casino Resort, both currently owned by American Casino and Entertainment Properties, will join Best Western’s rapidly expanding soft brand, BW Premier Collection. Best Western officials note this is the largest deal in Best Western’s 70-year history.
Las Vegas-based Golden Entertainment recently acquired American Casino and Entertainment Properties. The purchase is likely to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Golden Entertainment’s portfolio now includes three casinos in Pahrump and 50 taverns, as well as slot routes in Nevada and Montana and a casino in Maryland. The pending Golden Entertainment purchase also includes the two Arizona Charlie’s casino/hotels in Las Vegas.
“It’s a very exciting period for Best Western Hotels & Resorts as we will now offer two new and thrilling travel destinations for our guests,” said Ron Pohl, senior vice president and COO of Best Western Hotels & Resorts in a company release. “Whether you’re looking for exhilarating sights and gaming options, world-class dining and entertainment at your fingertips or just an unforgettable guest stay, these hotels provide it all. In addition, this fantastic partnership will allow travelers visiting these landmark properties to take advantage of our award-winning Best Western Rewards loyalty program, one of the richest loyalty programs in the industry.”
Launched in late 2015, BW Premier Collection will allow the properties to maintain their iconic identities in both Las Vegas and Laughlin, according to Best Western.
The term “soft branding” in the hospitality industry generally refers to a chain or franchise organization affiliation that has a hotel relying primarily on its individual identity rather than that of the chain or organization. The hotel gets to access the chain’s reservation system, but the formal connection is somewhat understated and indirect.

Stratosphere, Aquarius now BW Premier

				July 18, 2017 3:00 AM
				by
				Robert Mann 
Best Western Hotels & Resorts has announced that the Stratosphere Casino, Hotel and Tower and the Aquarius Casino Resort, both currently owned by American Casino and Entertainment Properties, will join Best Western’s rapidly expanding soft brand, BW Premier Collection. Best Western officials note this is the largest deal in Best Western’s 70-year history.
Las Vegas-based Golden Entertainment recently acquired American Casino and Entertainment Properties. The purchase is likely to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Golden Entertainment’s portfolio now includes three casinos in Pahrump and 50 taverns, as well as slot routes in Nevada and Montana and a casino in Maryland. The pending Golden Entertainment purchase also includes the two Arizona Charlie’s casino/hotels in Las Vegas.
“It’s a very exciting period for Best Western Hotels & Resorts as we will now offer two new and thrilling travel destinations for our guests,” said Ron Pohl, senior vice president and COO of Best Western Hotels & Resorts in a company release. “Whether you’re looking for exhilarating sights and gaming options, world-class dining and entertainment at your fingertips or just an unforgettable guest stay, these hotels provide it all. In addition, this fantastic partnership will allow travelers visiting these landmark properties to take advantage of our award-winning Best Western Rewards loyalty program, one of the richest loyalty programs in the industry.”
Launched in late 2015, BW Premier Collection will allow the properties to maintain their iconic identities in both Las Vegas and Laughlin, according to Best Western.
The term “soft branding” in the hospitality industry generally refers to a chain or franchise organization affiliation that has a hotel relying primarily on its individual identity rather than that of the chain or organization. The hotel gets to access the chain’s reservation system, but the formal connection is somewhat understated and indirect.

Why Could Golden Entertainment Inc (GDEN) Not Be As Efficient As Its Industry?



Cameron Brookes 


            				July 15, 2017			        


 Golden Entertainment Inc’s (NASDAQ:GDEN) ROE of 9% over the past year, compared to its industry’s 25.49%, indicates that investors would have been better off choosing the broader industry in terms of returns generated on their committed capital. However, there is more to a company’s ROE than just the blunt-final-figure. That’s why I always advise investors to analyze the ROE at a much lower level and consider the numerous factors that affect a company’s past performance. Check out our latest analysis for Golden Entertainment 
Peeling the layers of ROE – trisecting a company’s profitability
 ROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator.Generally, an ROE of 20% or more is considered highly attractive for any investment consideration. Although, it’s more of an industry-specific ratio as the constituents share similar risk profile.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 ROE above the cost of equity estimate indicates value creation, which apparently is the only reason shares rally. The cost of equity can be estimated through a popular and Nobel-prize winning method called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). With a few sets of assumptions, the CAPM pegs GDEN’s cost of equity at 8.47%, compared to its ROE of 9%.


 Golden Entertainment (NasdaqGM:GDEN) Last Perf Jul 15th 17
 
                         Using Dupont Analysis, we find out that ROE is composed of three ratios: profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. The method reflects the impact of change in key figures in both the income statement and the balance sheet. The analysis provides a bird’s-eye view on the strengths and weaknesses of the company.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 A reflection of how net profit margin has affected ROE in the past can be seen in the trend of income and revenue. An investor can gauge a fair estimate of how it’s going to play out in the future by looking at the analysts’ forecasts in the years ahead.The asset turnover for a capital intensive industry such as bricks-and-mortar retail would be substantially lower than the e-commerce retail industry. A comparison with the industry can be drawn through ROA, which represents earnings as a percentage of assets. Golden Entertainment’s ROA stood at 2.5% in the past year, compared to the industry’s 9.98%.
 

 Golden Entertainment (NasdaqGM:GDEN) Historical Debt Jul 15th 17
 
 The last but not the least is the financial leverage. It’s an important ratio as a company can hide its poor operating and asset-use efficiency by increasing leverage. Thus, along with ROE, we should look at the Return on capital, which reflects earnings as a percentage of overall capital employed, including debt. For GDEN, ROC stood at 3% versus the industry’s 12.31%.
Why is ROE called the mother of all ratios
 On the surface, ROE appears to be a simple profitability ratio indicating the return an investor should expect. However, for a sound investment consideration, it should still appear good when a company’s debt profile, profit-revenue trend, and leverage are considered. What do the analysts think about Golden Entertainment’s ROE three-years ahead? I recommend you see our latest FREE analysis report to find out!

Sh*t You May Have Missed While Miss Behave-ing….yeah.		 



Posted By: BigAzMarty
July 14, 2017



It’s Sh*t You May Have Missed for the week ending July 14, 2017.
Hey all! BigAZMarty here, back and refreshed and ready to put out the news on our favorite place, Las Vegas!
1. This past weekend Planet Hollywood had to close up portions (and then clean up) after a fire water pipe broke which flooded the Mezzanine Level and part of the casino floor as well as flooding one of the hotel’s Elevator banks. Read/watch KTNV here. Some of the shows (namely Crazy Girls and Sin City Comedy) had to be temporarily postponed while the clean up continued. UPDATE: According to EATER Vegas here, the damage to Planet Dailies (PH’s 23-hour cafe) will require a full remodel and won’t be opening back up until Oct 1. Not sure how this will affect Room Service since it’s basically a subset of the Planet Dailies menu. Jeez, nice to know that their Facility Maintenance Department is still horrible.
2. Hard Rock Casinos and Loews Hotels have announced a data breach and customer information may have been stolen all due to a 3rd party reservation system used by both hotel chains. Read ZDNet here. Check your credit reports folks if you’ve had or are booked a stay in the system when it was breached. UPDATE: LVRJ reporting that a third Hotel chain has been compromised… Trump Hotels. Read LVRJ here.
3. Caesars has announced the opening of Caesars Studios, it’s that big white tent out the back of Paris/Bally’s. It’s a large production facility and they’re already recording “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” there. Read PRNewswire here.
4. Caesars has also announced two new executive hirings to become more aggressive in international development and M&A’s once the bankrupt CEOC has cleared its re-organization. Read PRNewswire here.
5. Ouch…and we hope he’s recovering nicely as MGM Exec Bobby Baldwin fell down two flights of stairs at the Aria Resort. Read LVRJ here.
6. The Blackstone Group has picked up more Las Vegas Real Estate, this time in specialty retail. They have purchased the World Market Center near the North Vegas Outlets near Downtown. For you aspiring room designers and flippers this is the biggest showroom of furniture in the Western US. Read LVRJ here.
7. Renderings of the soon to be Front Yard at Ellis Island on Koval Lane have surfaced via TravelVegas (MarC of course) here and LVRJ here. Hard to believe this is a family run business and they’ve purchased Super 8 (next door) and remodeling those rooms while doing this expansion all at the same time. Since most of the Koval Lane hotels have been eaten up by Caesars Entertainment and leveled on the north side of Koval, Ellis Island will have really good night sight lines of the strip.
8. Westgate gets a $2.2M decision on the case of the non-paying Exhibit A Circle LLC that had the Elvis Memorabilia on display at the Westgate when Elis Presley Way was freshly renamed. Read LVRJ here. The property case is still up as that lawsuit was on hold until the rent issue was dealt with.
9. LVRJ has an interesting article on how Golden Entertainment will be a “great fit” as owners of The Stratosphere, both AZ Charlies and the Laughlin Aquarius. Read LVRJ here. Personally, I just can’t wrap my head around going from Slot Route, Pubs, and some small Pahrump casinos to buying some large LV and Laughlin properties. Maybe it’s Dotty’s envy as they own the Boulder City Hoover Dam Lodge and Laughlin River Lodge.
10. SLS is having an interesting HR week or two, after hiring a lot of Aliante’s people (read LVRJ here) they lose the top two guys they hired back in January, read LVRJ here. Alex Merulo’s group will be taking over on gaming approval in the 3rd Quarter….suggestion to him is to buy the All Net Arena Land and expand as a large Sahara.
11. Kats via LVRJ reports that Cirque du Soleil has merged with Blue Man Group, read here. I’d say MGM is set to pay just one company now for their main everyday resort entertainment….the only exclusion is Excalibur and Monte Carlo (soon to be Park MGM/NoMad).
12. For you that missed 4th of July fireworks here is the YouTube link from Robin’s coverage at Caesars Palace here.
13. Vital Vegas has a nice pictorial on the demo of Palace Station’s old hotel wings here. Wrapped in an OJ wrapper as well…too funny. This will clear the space for the new tower that will be between the existing tower and the I-15.
14. MarC via FrontDeskTip also has a fairly concise list of Caesars improvements in Las Vegas here. The convention space is interesting because the Caesars Studio is back there as well behind Bally’s. Of note, a small sportsbook at The Cromwell opening back near check-in at the former high roller slot area. My wife and I have stayed there at Cromwell and the casino floor on the north side is fairly underutilized. I’d seriously move the Video Poker to the North Side and Slots to the South Side. At least that would give the casino floor some consistency.
15. Eater Vegas has coverage of The Cromwell’s new 24-hour Quick Serve option, Eatwell here. A $12 Italian? Really? They should have put in an Earl of Sandwich instead.
16. Downtown Grand is expanding even further with the announcement of another hotel tower per Eater Vegas here. It will be eight stories and mimics the existing tower look but will be a lot longer and lower than the existing towers. An additional 495 rooms to be part of the resort on the 4th Street side between Ogden and Stewart Aves.
17. WTF, this ACEP deal while selling it to Golden Entertainment is, well, just odd. So The Stratosphere and Laughlin’s Aquarius will be BW Premier locations in an affiliation with Best Western. Read Commercial Property Executive here. For you that did not know there is already a Best Western on the strip, Casino Royale between Harrah’s and Venetian is the only other casino/hotel on the strip to carry the Best Western name (Best Western Plus). Arizona Charlies (both locations) are excluded from the deal.
18. Bally’s finally has a new show in the former Drai’s club (now called the Back Room) and it’s called the “Miss Behave Gameshow.” It’s really different than what was originally said about it, read here at LV Sun.
19. LV Weekly’s Best Of 2017 results are in, read here. The easiest way to navigate is that gray box to the right to get to the categories you want to read. For those of you that have never tried In-N-Out burgers (Best Burger winner) you MUST eat them fresh as there is a huge difference in taste if they’ve sat in a bag for too long…especially the fries…and read here for the “secret” menu for it. My choice is a Double Double Animal Style with an extra slice of cheese (think of it as tasty glue to hold it all together).
20. Remnants of Whisky Sky Bar at Green Valley Ranch have been made over along with the check in area, read here at LVWeekly via LVSun for details on the new Lobby Bar. Somehow windows to the outside are a break with Las Vegas tradition, which is, never let them see the outside from the bar or the casino floor.
21. Industry Weekly (LVSun) has the big shows by date for this upcoming weekend here. I think Bruno is the big draw but Wiz has that YouTube video which has taken the most music video watches title recently.
22. Robin via Niche via LVRJ reports Britney has donated $1M to Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation Britney Spears Campus read here. All from ticket sales from P”iece of Me” at Axis Theater…lets hope she resigns that residency to continue the charitable work in Nevada.
23. Robin also has Hooters International Swimsuit Invitational coverage at The Palms, he hasn’t yet posted the final photos yet so here is his preview.
24. Casino.org reporting more approvals for Caesars CEOC re-org (OpCo remains Caesars and PropCo REIT goes to Bond and Debt Holders) specific for New Jersey and Atlantic City here. Of note, there is the tidbit about the CEOC coming out of bankruptcy in September pending all regulatory and stockholder approvals.
25. Finally, we know where the Mayweather/McGregor fight will be held and what date, Aug 26 at T-Mobile Arena (expect a huge upswing in surge parking at nearby MGM parking garages). According to LVRJ’s article here they had to move the Big3 basketball games to MGM Garden Arena for that date. Pay per view price is $89.95
So that’s it for this week’s edition of Las Vegas news and updates. Now to our Editor-In-Chief, Michael Movestro, for our stuff and more.

#16 – correct me if I am missing something here but does the Downtown Grand really need 495 more rooms? The one time I was there it was d-e-a-d. And I am not sure to smile or cry that there is another something in Vegas that is going to be called The Quad.

From what we’ve heard the new Citrus pool events at Downtown Grand are a huge success and part of why they are looking to add more rooms and amenities.  I see it as they are still trying and evidently it’s starting to stick enough to expand the property now to gain more profits.  That and the fact it’s the next closest resort to Zappos isn’t a bad thing either.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



B Value | A Growth | B Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Golden Gaming and Lakes Entertainment Merger Closes
 


 

 




 





 


LAS VEGAS and MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Golden Entertainment, Inc. (formerly Lakes Entertainment, Inc.) (NASDAQ:   LACO) announced today that the merger between Sartini Gaming, Inc. ("Golden Gaming") and a subsidiary of Lakes Entertainment, Inc. has closed, after receiving various approvals from the Lakes' shareholders at the company's annual meeting on July 29. In connection with the merger, Lakes has been renamed Golden Entertainment, Inc.  
The all-stock transaction unites two renowned and respected brands in the gaming space. The newly combined company operates approximately 9,250 slot machines and video lottery terminals in Nevada and Maryland across four casino properties, 48 taverns and 670 route locations. Golden Entertainment's headquarters is now based in Las Vegas, Nevada.
"Today is a truly monumental and meaningful day for our company, our team members, our business partners and the markets we collectively serve," said Blake L. Sartini, the newly-appointed President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Golden Entertainment, Inc. "With Golden Entertainment, we now have a national, diversified gaming company with strong assets across the country. And with this infrastructure, we look forward to further enhancing our unique blend of distributed gaming, casinos and taverns."
Lyle Berman, former Chairman of Lakes Entertainment Inc. stated, "Our cash along with the Rocky Gap Casino, when combined with the diverse operations of Golden Gaming, provides an exciting growth opportunity for our existing and future shareholders. The combined company's refinanced debt will provide an immediate benefit in company net income and free cash flow."
Lakes issued an aggregate of 8,229,908 shares of its common stock in connection with the merger, of which 7,772,736 shares (subject to post-closing adjustments) were issued to The Blake L. Sartini and Delise F. Sartini Family Trust, the sole shareholder of Golden Gaming. The company's common stock continues to be traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market and its trading symbol, effective August 4, 2015, will be changed from "LACO" to "GDEN".
In connection with the closing of the merger, the size of the board of directors of the combined company was increased from five to seven. Larry Barenbaum and Ray Moberg resigned from the formerly Lakes Entertainment board. Subsequently, Blake Sartini was appointed the new Chairman of the Board of Golden Entertainment, and the remaining three vacancies were filled by the following appointees:

Mark Lipparelli – Chief Executive Officer of Gioco Ventures, a strategic advisory and product development firm serving the gaming, investment, technology and entertainment industries across the globe. Lipparelli also currently represents State Senate District 6 in the Nevada Legislature, a post he has held since December 2014. Lipparelli is a board trustee of the University of Nevada Foundation, board member of the National Center for Responsible Gaming and served as a board member and Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board between 2009 and 2012. 
Robert Miodunski – former Chief Executive Officer of American Gaming Systems from 2010 until its acquisition by Apollo Entertainment in late 2014. Miodunski also previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Gaming Corporation from 2001 to 2004 and President of United Coin from 1994 to 1999. From 2005 to 2008, Miodunski served on the board of directors of Elixir Gaming Technologies, Inc. 
Terrence Wright – Chairman of the Board and majority owner of Westcor Land Title Insurance Company, a company he founded in 1991 and which is licensed to issue policies of title insurance throughout the United States. Wright is currently on the board of Southwest Gas Corporation, is an emeritus member and past chairman of the University of Nevada Las Vegas Foundation Board and is the past chairman for the Nevada Development Authority, the Nevada Land Title Association and the Nevada Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization.
Messrs. Sartini, Lipparelli, Miodunski and Wright join existing directors Lyle A. Berman; Timothy J. Cope (formerly President and Chief Financial Officer of Lakes) and Neil I. Sell on the Golden Entertainment board. The company's newly-appointed management team consists of Sartini; Chief Financial Officer Matthew W. Flandermeyer; and Chief Operating Officer Stephen A. Arcana.
Golden Entertainment also announced today the successful syndication and closing of a new $160 million senior secured credit facility, comprising a $120 million senior secured term loan (which was fully drawn at closing) and a $40 million senior secured revolving credit facility (of which $25 million was drawn at closing). The new facility matures in 2020. Borrowings under the new facility bear interest, at the company's option, at either (1) the highest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the Eurodollar rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or the administrative agent's prime rate as announced from time to time, or (2) the Eurodollar rate for the applicable interest period, plus an applicable margin based on the company's leverage ratio ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% for Eurodollar loans and 0.75% to 1.75% for base rate loans. Net proceeds from the new facility were used to repay and discharge all of the outstanding senior secured indebtedness of Golden Gaming as well as Lakes' outstanding Rocky Gap indebtedness. The interest rates under the new senior secured credit facility, which are lower than previously anticipated, are expected to result in significant interest savings compared to Golden Gaming's prior interest expense. Capital One and KeyBank National Association acted as the joint lead arrangers and joint book runners for the new facility. Capital One acted as administration agent and KeyBank National Association acted as syndication agent in connection with the new facility.
Macquarie Capital served as Lakes' exclusive financial advisor. Gray, Plant, Mooty, Mooty & Bennett, P.A. served as legal counsel to Lakes. Union Gaming Advisors, LLC served as Golden Gaming's financial advisor. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to Golden Gaming. Hunton & Williams LLP served as legal counsel to the lenders.
