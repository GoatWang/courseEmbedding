Bio
 
About


 Mr. Baum grew up in Houston, Texas. His youth was spent working afternoons and weekends as a laborer unloading furniture trucks and delivering orders, and eventually as a salesperson and manager. His formative years were spent working with good people who did not have formal educations or much material wealth, but who were honest, striving, and hard-working, relying on common sense to guide their lives. Today, Mr. Baum continues to see the world through the prism of his youth and the lessons he learned back in Houston.In 1990, after graduating from Sharpstown High School, a public school profiled in a PBS Frontline documentary entitled Dropout Nation, Mr. Baum went into the highly competitive retail furniture business. At the age of 20, after his acceptance to attend the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Mr. Baum sold just about everything he owned to pay for his college experience. Two and a half years later, he graduated cum laude from UTA.  Following graduation from UTA, Mr. Baum completed his juris doctor degree and in the spring of 1998 he passed the California Bar. After practicing law for a short period and with a desire to marry patient advocacy with the pharmaceutical business, Mr. Baum started an online pharmacy business called YesRx, which served HIV-positive Californians. Through the success of his interest in YesRx, Mr. Baum capitalized his first fund and began a 10-year period managing capital as a principal investor, participating in more 200 financings in U.S. private and public companies. Throughout his professional career, Mr. Baum has worked to align his professional interests with his personal values. This commitment led to the founding of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY) in 2011 to provide patients, physicians and private and public payors with lower cost, high-quality compounded drugs as alternatives to expensive branded and generic drugs.When Martin Shkreli, former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, infamously acquired the marketing rights to the infectious disease drug Daraprim® and immediately raised its price by more than 5,000%, Mr. Baum was outraged and quickly led his team to develop a lower-priced compounded alternative.  Using the same core ingredient as Daraprim®, Imprimis combined it with another medication commonly taken with the medication and priced it at 99 cents per pill, compared to Turing’s cost of $750 per pill. During this time frame, Mr. Baum became a nationally-known advocate for lowering drug prices. Numerous articles were written about Mr. Baum and Imprimis and their story went viral. Imprimis became a model of how a small public company could take on big pharma and create market-based competition for drugs that benefited from artificially created monopolies.In the years leading up to the extensive 99 cent alternative to Daraprim® news coverage, Imprimis had developed novel compounded formulations (Dropless® and LessDrops®) for use following cataract surgery that today are saving the elderly population of America hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Dropless has changed the landscape of post-cataract surgery care because it allows many patients to avoid weeks of tedious and expensive post-surgical eye drops. Mr. Baum and Imprimis intend to continue leveraging this record of success by bringing new, affordable compounded drug innovations to market for Americans suffering from glaucoma (SimpleDrops®) and dry eye disease. Mr. Baum firmly believes the result of Imprimis’ efforts will be greater competition in the U.S. prescription pharmaceutical market, lower consumer prices for certain critical medicines, and greater access to safe, affordable drugs for all Americans.The Imprimis business model is delivering value for both patients and Imprimis shareholders.  Imprimis’ revenues have more than doubled during 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 and growth for 2017 and 2018 should accelerate. As a result of this performance, in 2016, Imprimis was named the 4th fastest growing pharma/biotech and the 12th overall fastest growing U.S. company according to Deloitte’s 2016 Technology Fast 500™ Ranking of the fastest growing companies in North America.In 2016, Mr. Baum was inspired to write a 75-page monograph on the issue of U.S. drug pricing policy and an Op-Ed piece on the same issue was published in the Wall Street Journal.  Later that year, Mr. Baum was invited to Oxford University to debate James Greenwood, head of BIO, the largest international pharmaceutical lobbying group. Mr. Baum’s debate in favor of the proposition, Big Pharma Prioritizes Profits Over Patients, won by one of the largest margins in the Oxford Union's nearly 200-year history.  In 2017, Mr. Baum was honored to author another Wall Street Journal Op-Ed piece on the issue of drug pricing which included proposed solutions to create competition for prescription drugs.Building Imprimis has involved many ups and downs. Many of the key decisions Mr. Baum has faced have been abstracted in a multi-part business school case (Case A, Case B, Case C, Case D) published by Harvard Business Publishing which is taught at Harvard Business School under the direction of Professor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell in his course on business strategy.In May of 2017, Mr. Baum was honored to give the College of Liberal Arts commencement address at UT Arlington, his alma mater (BA, cum laude, 1995).In June of 2017, Mr. Baum was named Entrepreneur of the Year™ for the San Diego region life sciences category by Ernst & Young LLP. In June of 2017, Mr. Baum announced a $20M Series A financing for Eton Pharmaceuticals, a spin-off company of Imprimis, which will be dedicated to forging competition for many high impact sterile injectable drug products that lack competition in the marketplace.In addition to serving as a Director on the Imprimis Board of Directors, Mr. Baum currently serves as a Senior Advisor to Curology, Inc., a VC-backed dermatology pharmaceutical company.  He is the Audit Committee Chairman of Ideal Power, Inc. (NASDAQ: IPWR) and is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Mr. Baum is married to a former U.S. Navy officer, has two children and resides in Del Mar, California.

Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acquires Intellectual Property Assets from Buderer Drug Company
June 20, 2013 9:12 am | Comments Off on Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acquires Intellectual Property Assets from Buderer Drug Company

Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY) today announced it has completed the acquisition of intellectual property (IP) rights related to certain proprietary innovations from the compounding pharmacy operations of Ohio-based Buderer Drug Company. The acquisition allows Imprimis to pursue the commercial development of these proprietary innovations and also provides Imprimis with a right of first refusal on additional Buderer Drug Company intellectual property and drug development opportunities.
Buderer Drug Company, which has served the needs of patients and physicians in Ohio since 1878, is a compounding pharmacy member of PCCA. This IP acquisition is the first to emerge from the Imprimis-PCCA relationship.
“Buderer Drug Company is a leading compounding pharmacy organization in the United States, and we are extremely pleased to announce this asset purchase,” said Mark L. Baum, Imprimis CEO. “This new relationship, which could lead to up to three new development programs, is a good example of our plan to begin to leverage our agreement with PCCA into proprietary IP that may ultimately lead to the FDA approval of new medicines to address unmet patient needs. We are in the process of preparing filings with the USPTO related to the acquired assets and intend to communicate with the marketplace with more specificity in the near-term. Ultimately, we intend to develop and commercialize any drug development assets we decide to pursue by utilizing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway has the ability to significantly reduce both cost and duration of the FDA approval process, bringing quality medications more quickly to patients who need them.”
“We are excited at the potential development and commercialization prospects of our ideas. We believe that Imprimis understands and appreciates the important role of the compounding pharmacist in the healthcare system. Further, Imprimis understands that the ideas we generate come from a ‘boots on the ground’ approach – dealing directly with doctors and their patients to address specific and often unmet patient needs. We also appreciate that some drugs are demonstrably difficult for compounders to make and that often times additional research and development is required before a drug can be used in humans, including more formal pre-clinical and clinical research.  We are looking forward to strengthening the bond between our companies and working toward bringing these medicines through the FDA approval process, and then to the marketplace, where they can help people with a myriad of different medical conditions,” said Matt Buderer, R.Ph., Vice President and Chief Compounding Pharmacist with Buderer Drug Company.
Compounding pharmacies work with physicians to develop medications for individual patients. Examples are alternative dosage strengths, or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles.
Access to these formulations may be limited if patients don’t live near a compounding pharmacy or cannot cover the out-of-pocket costs or if their physician is simply unaware of compounding options available to them. Baum said, “Commercialization of formulations developed by Buderer Drug Company by taking them through a regulated FDA process would in the long run allow more patients to benefit from these medications. At the same time, Imprimis respects the rights of pharmacists and physicians to continue to serve their patients’ needs. Imprimis believes having an FDA-approved derivative of compounding’s innovations will enhance the overall acceptance of compounding and develop new opportunities for compounders to serve patients.”
Gus Bassani, Pharm.D., Vice President of Consulting, R&D and Formulations with PCCA, and also an Imprimis board member, said, “Buderer Drug Company and its novel drug technologies are just one example of the depth of creativity and innovation possessed by PCCA’s members. We’ve desired to create a pathway for our members’ innovations that have commercial potential to get FDA approval. Imprimis has developed this pathway for PCCA pharmacy members and we hope to see more in the future.”
Baum added, “We will continue to be open to the ideas, innovation and unique ‘proximity to the patient’ of the more than 4,000 compounding pharmacy members that are a part of the proprietary PCCA network worldwide.”
About Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the commercial development of compounded drug formulations. Through its exclusive strategic relationship with Professional Compounding Centers of America (PCCA), the largest compounding pharmacy organization inNorth America, Imprimis expects to use its proprietary Accudel drug delivery technologies, as well as proprietary drug formulations for new indications and market data obtained through PCCA, to identify and pursue pharmaceutical development opportunities where there is a significant unmet medical need utilizing the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Imprimis’ most near term drug candidate, Impracor, is a Phase III product candidate that utilizes the Accudel topical cream formulation to deliver the active drug ketoprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), through the skin directly into the underlying tissues where the drug exerts its localized anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.
About Professional Compounding Centers of America, Inc. (PCCA) PCCA is the independent compounding pharmacist’s complete resource for fine chemicals, equipment, devices, flavors, ACPE-accredited training and education, pharmacy software, marketing, business and pharmacy consulting assistance.

Pharmaceutical Company Obtains Exclusive US Commercial Rights

Biotech Stocks News Apr 28, 2015 0 929 



In the world of pharmaceuticals, companies are always trying to expand and further develop new products by obtaining exclusive rights to the patent. Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IMMY) a pharmaceutical company that is dedicating their efforts on the creation and commercialization of proprietary compounded drug developments, announced Tuesday that they now have the exclusive US commercial rights to the patented compounded alkalinized lidocaine and heparin for the treatment of interstitial cystitis, also more commonly known as painful bladder syndrome.
Imprimis was able to obtain the non exclusive US licensing rights for Hep-Lido-A from Urigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc in October of last year. Imprimis with their license agreement had the choice to change to an exclusive license during the six month and one year anniversary period from the time of the agreement. “We are pleased to now have the exclusive US commercial rights for our patented Hep-Lido-A formulation. In 2014, physicians wrote more than 80,000 prescriptions of Hep-Lido-A, generating an estimated $5.5 million in sales.  In due course, we plan to capture substantially all of these legacy prescriptions, and have already begun sales to existing prescribers for their chronic care patients.  Our focus going forward is to continue to serve the existing Hep-Lido-A prescribers and patients, and importantly to share their experiences with new prescribers and their patients in order to significantly grow this business.  We have a positive and uplifting message we intend to share with new patients who are suffering with IC,” said Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis.
Mr. Baum added his input, “Over the last several months, we have been busy building relationships with IC thought leaders and new physician customers.  We are recruiting a team of seasoned urology sales and marketing professionals with experience and relationships in the IC community to lead our commercial activities.  Our team is witnessing firsthand how Hep-Lido-A is benefiting patients and we are inspired and passionate about helping the millions of patients suffering with this debilitating chronic condition.  We have partnered with leading IC advocacy organizations and our Defeat ICTM education campaign is gaining traction within the IC patient and physician communities.  It is a very exciting time for our company and we look forward to exhibiting at the American Urological Association annual meeting next month in New Orleans and visiting with members of the urology community.”

Mark L. Baum, Esq.  on File No. 4-500




Subject: File No. 4-500
From: Mark L. Baum, Esq.
Affiliation: The Baum Law Firm, Inc.

May 2, 2005


Jonathan G. Katz
Secretary, Securities Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549

Barbara Z. Sweeney
Senior Vice President and Corporate Secretary, NASD
1735 K Street, NW
Washington DC 20006-1500;

Dear Mr. Katz and Ms. Sweeney:

 

As a legal representative of numerous OTC traded companies, as a shareholder of many OTC listed companies and as a American concerned with the integrity of the US public securities marketplace, please accept this electronic message in support of an amendment to the rules affecting short position reporting by NASD member firms.

 

The cornerstone of the US securities market is transparency and fairness.  With greater transparency, the listed companies, financial institutions that finance these businesses and that buy and sell securities issued by these businesses, as well as the existing and future shareholders of these companies, will have the freedom to access critical information that can make or break an investment decision.  

 

The bottom line is that in this day and age, post-Enron/Worldcom/Tyco/Adelphia/AIG (� and so on), how in the world can policymakers deny the marketplace information about Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (an OTC listed business) that is available about Microsoft (a Nasdaq listed business) or any other non-OTC listed company.  

 

There is no issue in my recent memory that I believe, if acted upon, will help foster the kind of confidence and sense of market integrity that will lead to a more efficient, productive and fair OTC public securities marketplace.

 

I strongly urge you to make this rule change and continue the spirit of reform that is helping to insure that our markets are the beacon of light for the burgeoning global economy.

 

Respectfully submitted, 

 

Mark L. Baum, Esq.
