Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

                Transition to new firm said to start in first half of 2017
            



                Strategy said to be unchanged from current Asia macro focus
            



Alphadyne Asset Management LLC, a New York-based hedge-fund manager overseeing $4.8 billion in assets, will separate its Asia team into a new firm, said a person with knowledge of the matter.Bart Broadman, a co-founder of Alphadyne and chief investment officer of its Asia strategy, will be CIO of the new Singapore-based firm, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the information hasn’t been publicly disclosed. The transition will begin in the first half of 2017 and the new firm will retain its current investment focus on economic trends in Asia by trading in areas such as interest rates and foreign exchange, the person said.Eric Teo, the chief operating officer at Alphadyne’s Asia unit, declined to comment.




The Asia team, as a separate firm, is expected to manage a similar amount to the $2 billion it oversees now, including a $1 billion allocation from Alphadyne’s global fund, the person said.

Some of the region’s largest hedge-fund firms have resulted from spinoffs from global managers. Graticule Asset Management, the Singapore-based hedge-fund manager headed by Adam Levinson that had $4.2 billion of assets in September, emerged from Fortress Investment Group LLC’s Asia macro business early last year. Symmetry Investments, the Hong Kong-based firm led by Guo Feng, came from Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management and had $2.6 billion in assets as of February.“Spinouts make sense if an experienced manager wants more autonomy and more of a say in managing money and running a hedge fund,” said Will Tan, a managing director at Principle Partners Pte in Singapore, who specializes in recruiting for hedge funds. “And if it’s a high-profile manager, running his or her own show will also help in raising money from investors.”




Alphadyne’s Singapore unit is starting on its own as the hedge fund industry is struggling with investor redemptions and lackluster returns. Asia’s hedge funds suffered the highest withdrawals globally in October, with investors pulling $2.3 billion, or 1.3 percent of the region’s assets, according to data from Eurekahedge Pte.Alphadyne, which also has a third office in London, was founded in 2005 by Broadman and Philippe Khuong-Huu, who were colleagues at JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to the firm’s website. Investors include pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, investment consultants and sovereign wealth funds.




Before joining Alphadyne, Broadman spent 16 years working at JPMorgan, mainly in Asia, according to the Alphadyne website. His roles included serving as chairman of the management committee for the region and as global head of interest-rate derivatives.

Company Description


Alphadyne Asset Management conduct two main types of trading. The first is directional or macro trading, which generally involves taking positions that express a view on the future direction of a market parameter, such as an interest rate, a foreign exchange rate or the level of a market’s volatility. The second is relative value trading, which generally involves taking positions intended to exploit temporary anomalies in the relative values of similar instruments or markets, and general patterns of correlation between such instruments or markets. Some trades represent a combination of directional and relative value trading. While their primary focus is on interest rate and foreign exchange markets, as well as related volatility markets. Alphadyne Asset Management also trades in credit, equity and commodity markets. The firm mainly uses plain-vanilla interest rate swaps, Treasuries and other sovereign bonds, bond and interest rate futures, foreign exchange forwards, and related exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC) options. Secondary instruments include: credit default swaps, exchange-traded options on broad equity market indices and futures and options on indices of single commodities (such as gold and oil) or on baskets of commodities.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
