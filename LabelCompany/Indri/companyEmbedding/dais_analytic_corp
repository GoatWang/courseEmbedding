All Dais applications utilize the company’s breakthrough polymer technology. Drawing from the same family of polymer plastics, Dais has designed superior products that address heating & cooling, water and energy needs.
 

ConsERV™ & NanoAir™ HVAC products create a new generation of heating/cooling equipment, eliminating emissions from fluorocarbon refrigerant (CFC/HCFC) commonly used in HVAC and refrigeration. ConsERV™ & NanoAir™ HVAC present the opportunities for market leadership with breakthrough technology. Dais’ value proposition for the ConsERV™ & NanoAir™ HVAC applications is the ability to deliver improved heating, cooling, and refrigeration energy efficiencies while reducing the associated carbon footprint by more than 50%.
NanoClear™ clean water systems revolutionize water desalination and wastewater treatment with an eco-friendly, affordable, and simple process. This process is scalable to almost any size. Commercially available Dais nano-materials have the control and selectivity to remove virtually any substance, providing affordable, abundant, and energy-efficient clean water.
NanoCap™ ultracapacitors offer the potential of an energy storage unit capable of replacing the internal combustion engine. This ultracapacitor can dramatically improve power delivery in both consumer electronics and in a “smart grid” power transmission. With the advent of an energy storage device scalable for small or large projects, electricity from intermittent electricity generators like solar panels and wind turbines could be stored on an individual, community, or societal level. Such storage would allow the steady and predictable release of renewable electricity into the grid, greatly advancing electricity delivery.

Dais Analytic Corporation, a commercial nanotechnology materials company selling its Aqualyte membrane nanomaterial with engineered processes for use addressing needs in the worldwide air, energy and water markets, today announced it has received an order for delivery of its first NanoClear product targeted to be used in for the growing market for the estimated 88.6 million cubic meter/day desalination market of water. NanoClear is a revolutionary water cleaning architecture enabled by the features in Dais`s nanomaterial -- Aqualyte. According to www.gwi.com, 2016 is was the third consecutive year that the international desalination market has seen year-on-year growth.
The desalination project is one of three projects that Aquabaero is undertaking with NanoClear systems. The other two systems will be used in projects that focus on NanoClear`s proven ability to clean industrial wastewater.
"Dais`s entrance into the desalination market is the result of 3 years of research into how to optimize our NanoClear system for the desalination process," says Tim Tangredi, CEO and President of Dais. "We believe NanoClear`s ability to use waste heat to generate potable water that is a 1,000 times cleaner than global standards require and our ability to handle wastewater concentrated up to 3X 3 times the normal limit of a reverse osmosis system uniquely positions the Company to establish higher performance standards for desalination projects," continued Tangredi.
"The market for desalination is diverse and there are specific applications where NanoClear is particularly suited," said Brian Johnson, Chief Technology Officer for Dais. "Membrane used in NanoClear can handle higher levels of salinity than conventional reverse osmosis systems and the surface of our membrane inherently resists bacterial and fungal growth. This makes NanoClear the right choice for specific market segments."
The desalination project is one of three projects that Aquabaero is undertaking with NanoClear systems. The other two systems will be used in projects that focus on NanoClear`s proven ability to clean industrial wastewater.
NanoClear`s benefits compared to standard reverse osmosis systems include simpler plant engineering, lower initial and operating costs, safe separation of numerous contaminants from the dirty wastewater stream, and high quality product water.(c)  2017 Times of Zambia.
