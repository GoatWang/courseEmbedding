A commitment to sustainability is at the foundation of everything we do.












We build sustainability into everything we do.



Our visionWe believe in minimizing the environmental impact of our buildings.
Read moreWe go through great efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of the construction and operation of our buildings, enhancing our client’s comfort, health and financial savings.We aim for the highest level of performance in energy and water efficiency, waste management, tenant engagement, environmental construction, sustainable building operations, green building certifications, materials selection and community involvement.Our track recordFrom awards to certifications, our commitment to sustainability is making an impact.

We will also include at least two pollinator-friendly plants in any new landscape installations.Certifications: Participate in the LEED EB Volume Program and certify eligible existing buildingsNew DevelopmentCertifications: To ensure our sustainability policies are implemented, all ground-up construction will pursue LEED Gold certification or better, and all major renovations will pursue LEED Silver certification or betterMaterials: To reduce impacts on human health and our environmental footprint throughout our supply chain, materials purchased for and disposed of during our projects will meet the rigorous standards in this policy: Construction Materials Sustainability Policy.Total materials used in development projects will achieve at least 20% recycled content.

Read moreWaterIn 2015, the result of our interior and exterior projects was an overall decrease in water use like-for-like by 8.9%, an impressive achievement, bringing our total reduction from 2012 levels to 10%. While we executed a variety of water-saving projects, we believe this large reduction was largely driven by legislation restricting outdoor watering as a result of the drought. Completed a major turf removal project in Long Beach that resulted in a savings of over 3 million gallons from 2014 levels, a 13% reduction in campus consumption overall. We also completed a major irrigation retrofit in 11 San Diego buildings, resulting in another 3 million gallon annual savings and an 18% reduction in overall consumption. Our reclaimed water infrastructure saves nearly 22.3 million gallons of potable water annually.Recycling and CompostingWe achieved an office waste diversion rate of 54% in 2015, a 3% increase from 2014 levels. Waste diversion is waste that is recycled or composted.Green CleaningThe high performance of our green cleaning program was verified via the LEED for Existing Buildings Volume Prototype certification process. The cleaning products we use meet the relevant LEED environment standard, either GreenSeal or the California Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) limit. Our vacuums achieve the Carpet and Rug Institute Seal of Approval, and we use microfiber cloths and rags to capture additional dirt to improve air quality. In 2015, we have expanded our use of aqueous ozone to 11 buildings in San Diego, which eliminates the need to use most cleaning chemicals.Janitors are the eyes and ears of a building, and have the ability to report energy and water waste as well as noncompliance with recycling practices, but janitors are not a population that is typically included in sustainability discussions. The US Green Building Council Los Angeles Chapter (USGBC-LA), Building Skills Partnership (BSP), Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the Building Owners and Managers Association of Greater Los Angeles (BOMA-GLA) created a Green Janitor Education program to provide training on sustainability topics like vampire power, turning off lights, and reporting leaks. We piloted this training in our 800,000 square foot Long Beach campus, and the program was so popular and successful that we scaled it to our entire Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego portfolios, over 4.9 million square feet, or 40% of our portfolio and 88 total janitors. Janitors reported not only implementing enhanced sustainability practices at work, but also bringing those practices, like making sure to turn off unneeded lights, home as well.Electric Vehicle Charging StationsWe support the mainstream adoption of electric cars, so we have been expanding our network of electric vehicle charging stations. We added an additional 17stations in 2015, for a portfolio total of 52 stations. 2015 EV charging highlights include: 646 unique users, 45.7 tons of CO2 saved, 12,394 gallons of gasoline saved and EV charging stations installed at every new development project.Energy EfficiencyWhen it comes to reducing building energy use, we get results.
Read moreThe energy management projects we implemented in 2015 reduced overall portfolio energy use by 3.7% and will save nearly 8.2 million kilowatt-hours annually. This is equivalent to planting 144,904 trees and letting them grow for 10 years. We were able to achieve these results via the implementation of both traditional and innovative energy efficiency projects, including demand response strategies, installation of HVAC oil fouling removal technologies, lighting system retrofits, installation of Variable Frequency Drives, elevator modernization projects, retrocommissioning and energy auditing. A great example of a retrocommissioning project is our 303 Second Street building (740,747 square feet) which went through retrocommissioning in 2014 and then spent 2015 implementing findings. Through working with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) on the incentives, the building was able to reduce its energy use by 10%, over two million kWh, and received a rebate of over $86,000 from the utility for doing this work.1US Environmental Protection Agency.

Read moreThe Leadership in Energy Efficient and Environmental Design certification process is designed to address the entire lifecycle of a property, taking into account issues like site design, low-impact development, water and energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, materials and resources used in construction, and innovative responses to unique building or site conditions. In recent years, we’ve built all our new development projects to LEED specifications and achieved Gold or Silver certification levels for several buildings.We are also actively pursuing LEED certification for LEED Platinum, Existing BuildingFremont Lake Union Center/801 N 34th Street, SeattleKey Center, BellevueLEED Gold, Existing BuildingSkyline Tower, Bellevue 100 First Street, San Francisco​303 Second Street San Francisco201 Third Street, San FranciscoLEED Platinum, Core & Shell 350 Mission, San Francisco333 Brannan, San FranciscoLEED Gold, Core & Shell Westlake Terry/320 Westlake Avenue N, SeattleWestlake Terry/321 Terry Avenue N, Seattle360 Third Street, San Francisco331 Fairchild Drive, Mountain ViewMountain View Campus, Mountain ViewSunnyvale Campus/505 Mathilda Avenue, SunnyvaleSunnyvale Campus/555 Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale​Liberty Station, San Diego The Heights at Del Mar/12790 El Camino Real, San DiegoLEED Silver, Core & ShellKilroy Airport Center/2260 E Imperial Highway, El Segundo2211 Michelson Drive, Irvine Kilroy Sabre Springs/13480 Evening Creek Drive, San DiegoLEED Certified, Core & ShellFremont Lake View, Seattle​1633 26th Street, Santa Monica LEED Platinum, Commercial Interiors​Kilroy Airport Center/2260 E Imperial Highway, El SegundoLEED Gold, Commercial Interiors Westlake Terry/321 Terry Avenue N, Seattle401 Terry*, Seattle 331 Fairchild Drive, Mountain ViewKilroy Hollywood Regional Office* at Sunset Media Center, Los Angeles​LEED Silver, Commercial InteriorsMission City Corporate Center/​2375 Northside Drive*, San Diego LEED Gold, New ConstructionSunnyvale Campus/605 Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale LEED Silver, New ConstructionKilroy Airport Center/3880 Kilroy Airport Way, Long Beach *LEED certification covers partial building.BOMA 360 CertificationEleven of our buildings are BOMA 360 certified.
