Our mission is to be at the forefront of cfDNA technology and bioinformatics. We offer revolutionary diagnostics developed by doctors for doctors, to detect cancer early, precisely monitor & actively manage.TECHNOLOGYIn recent years many new scientific findings concerning cancer research have been reported, which have led not only to new therapies but also to new diagnostic methods. Today we know that in a very large number of cases a tumour is indicated by substantial changes in the genetic material of the degenerated cells. This difference between the genetic material of the tumor cells and the normal cells of the body can be detected with modern procedures.Many tumors release their cellular content such as DNA into the bloodstream e.g. due to cell death. These tumour-specific changes, at sufficiently high concentration, can be detected and quantified as cell-free tumour DNA in the blood.Cancer is a disease in which mutations in the genomic DNA of an individual cell lead to a disruption of the normal checks and balances (homeostasis), which in normal state ensure that cell multiplication is matched closely to the body’s needs. A cancer cell has lost the ability to respond to homeostatic needs and continues to divide relentlessly, in one or multiple (metastatic) sites, e.g. driven by positive (oncogene) or lack of negative (suppressorgene) influences.These mutations in the already developed tissue/organ (somatic) cells lead to cancer (e.g. breast, lung, colon) and in the overwhelming majority of adult cancers this follows after the accumulation of multiple mutations. There is evidence suggesting that aneuploidy, which appears as amplifications and/or losses of large sequences of genetic material, develops earlier than the bulk of mutations, which occur in single DNA base pairs**. This aneuploidy is a major hallmark of genomic changes in malignant cell transformation, which occurs early and is the underpinning foundation of our CNI scoring assays.The blood analysis to determine cell-free tumour DNA is a new tool, which can help in the assessment of the efficacy of drug therapies in tumour diseases. The CNI-Score we provide is reflecting the amount of circulating tumour DNA.NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCINGNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a method which allows scientists to determine the sequence of the whole human genome, and such DNA “mapping” can now be performed on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood that is derived from dying (“turning-over”) cells. Indeed such cfDNA is continuously entering the bloodstream, with a turnover half life of some minutes, before the body digests and recycles the constituents. What has been appreciated is that tumor-derived cfDNA circulates in the bloodstream with concentrations varying from below 1% to more then 80% and can be differentiated from normal DNA by the mutational “fingerprint”-best detected by the ‘defining’ gains and losses (DNA Copy Number Instability or CNI score).After sequencing of the cfDNA the individual fragments are uniquely mapped to the human genome according to their respective sequence. Fragment counts per genomic region are compared to the distribution obtained in normal reference samples. Genomic regions with fragment counts that significantly deviate from this normal distribution represent regions with gains and losses present in the tumor genome. These regions can be compared in the serial sampling and can indicate e.g. the appearance of a new probably more aggressive cancer clone. This information can provide actionable information. NGS of cell-free DNA in Healthy HumansBeck, J. et al. Profile of the circulating DNA in apparently healthy individuals. Clin Chem. 2009; 55: 730-8.Circulating nucleic acids (CNAs) have been shown to have diagnostic utility in human diseases. The use of mass sequencing and bioinformatics provides the basis for new diagnostic approaches that use CNAs as biomarkers for both malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Breast Cancer cfDNA with NGSBeck J, Urnovitz HB, Mitchell WM, Schütz E.  Next generation sequencing of serum circulating nucleic acids from patients with invasive ductal breast cancer reveals differences to healthy and nonmalignant controls. Mol Cancer Res 2010; 8:335-42.Chronix has first used the NGS technology for investigation into the use in breast cancer with very promising results. Prostate Cancer Blood TestSchütz, E., et al. Chromosomal Instability in Cell-Free DNA Is a Serum Biomarker for Prostate Cancer. Clinical Chemistry 2015; 61: 239-248.Tumor-specific cell free DNA (cfDNA) present in serum and plasma provides a real-time, easily accessible surrogate. We demonstrated variations in the number of  cfDNA sequences circulating in the serum of patients with prostate cancer compared with healthy controls.MANAGEMENT Howard B.

Gains and losses of large chromosome sections that are present in the genome of cancer cells are detected and combined in a comprehensive copy number instability (CNI) score that can indicate tumor existance, remission or progression. Chronix blood tests are suitable for therapy monitoring for patients with chemotherapy or immunotherapy and for relapse monitoring after tumor resection (CNI MONITOR), screening (CNI SCREEN) and/or 2nd opinion regarding eventual tissue biopsis (CNI 2nd OPINION).WHY OUR TESTS ARE SO EFFECTIVE? Safe Noninvasive Testing Very High Efficiency Whole Genome Testing×Safe Noninvasive TestingA blood sample of 16mm is taken. Non-invasive and without radiation, safe for those pregnant and nursing mothers.Close×Very High EfficiencyA blinded clinical trial conducted by Chronix Biomedical to study a group of patients undergoing cancer treatments showed, that the CNI MONITOR test is suitable for therapy monitoring for patients with chemotherapy or immunotherapy and for relapse monitoring after tumor resection- CNI MONITOR predicted outcome results 6-9 weeks earlier than radiography.CNI score based predictions of a therapy failure were correct in 89% of times (positive predictive value, PPV) when based on the change from baseline to cycle 2. When data from another sample obtained prior to cycle 3 was included the prediction of progressive disease was correct in 100% of the cases.In clinical practice conventional biochemical tumor markers are often used during therapy to assess drug efficacy. When compared to the early prediction of outcome gained by CNI score, a highly significant lower accuracy was found.Weiss, G.J., et al. “Changes in tumor cell-free DNA copy number instability (CNI) predict therapeutic response in metastatic cancers.” Cancer Research 76.14 Supplement (2016): 3138-3138.Close×Whole Genome TestingAdvantages of this new technology, are that we can now look at the entirety of the body and its health state relating to cancer. Current scanning and tissue biopsy can only look at a specific part of the body, such as the lung or prostate, and is usually only carried out on presentation of symptoms.CloseOncologists opinionsorder testscontact usCHRONIX NEWS   chornixadm    2017-07-14T09:24:27+00:00 Liquid biopsy – a cancer test that detects the disease at an early stageA liquid biopsy is a test for cancer, to which the material is obtained by simple blood extraction.

The study compares the accuracy of Chronix’s CNI-based test at predicting a clinical response, as early as after the first cycle of chemotherapy compared to CA19-9, a commonly used biomarker.   chornixadm    2017-06-06T06:15:52+00:00 Chronix Biomedical presents positive data on prognostic test in head/neck cancer study data at ASCOStudy finds CNI score to be a stronger predictor of time to recurrence in head and neck cancer than current method based on lymph node invasion. The study enrolled 54 patients undergoing surgery for this cancer type and evaluated the Chronix test as a predictor of time to progression in comparison with the current method based on the degree of tumour invasion of lymph nodes (pN status).READ MOREVIDEOS   chornixadm    2017-07-14T08:31:33+00:00 Madappa N.
