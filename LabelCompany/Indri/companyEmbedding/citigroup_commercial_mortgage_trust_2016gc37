                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

 PART II
� OTHER INFORMATION  Item�2. Legal Proceedings. 
Disclosure from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee:

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (�DBTCA�) and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (�DBNTC�) have been sued by
investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities (�RMBS�) trusts. 
On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a
derivative action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of
contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA�s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class
action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint
alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19,
2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are governed by pooling and servicing agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in
the motion to dismiss. On March 22, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in federal court. In the amended complaint, plaintiffs assert claims in connection with 62 trusts governed by indenture agreements. The amended complaint alleges that
the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $9.8 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive motions with
respect to the amended complaint. Discovery is ongoing.  On March 25, 2016, the BlackRock plaintiffs filed a state court action in
the Superior Court of California, Orange County that involves 513 trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, alleging three causes of action: breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; and breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of
interest. Plaintiffs purport to bring the action on behalf of themselves and all other current owners of certificates in the 513 trusts. The complaint currently names only DBTCA as a defendant, even though DBTCA is the trustee for only one of the
513 trusts. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $85.1 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBTCA has not yet been served with the
complaint. Discovery has not yet commenced.
 On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank
A.G. (collectively, �IKB�), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a Summons With Notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. It appears that IKB may assert
claims for violation of the TIA, violation of New York�s Streit Act, breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and unjust enrichment. IKB appears to allege that DBNTC and DBTCA
are liable for over U.S. $274 million of damages. DBNTC and DBTCA accepted service of the summons with notice. IKB must file a complaint by May 27, 2016. Discovery has not yet commenced. 
DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA�s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing
paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction.

      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $7,816,000 class G or the $28,657,724 class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 54 loans secured by 64 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $697.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, 
      The Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.6%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool has higher leverage statistics than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average (WA) Fitch 
      debt service coverage ratio of 1.04x is below both the YTD 2016 average 
      of 1.14x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's weighted average (WA) 
      Fitch LTV of 115.3% is above both the YTD 2016 average of 108.7% and the 
      2015 average of 109.3%.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 56.1% of the 
      pool by balance. This is in line with the YTD 2016 average of 56.2% and 
      greater than the 2015 average of 49.3%. The pool's average concentration 
      resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 419, which is comparable 
      to the YTD 2016 average of 430, but worse than the 2015 average of 367.
    

      Good Primary Market Exposure: Seven out of the top 10 properties 
      totaling 39.7% of the pool are located in the central business districts 
      of primary markets including New York, Denver, Los Angeles and Austin.
    

      Above-Average Hotel Exposure: There are six loans, representing 16.2% of 
      the pool, that consist of hotel properties, plus a mixed-use building 
      with a hotel component that makes up 5.7% of the pool. This is higher 
      than the YTD 2016 average of 14.9% and the 2015 average hotel 
      concentration of 17%. Hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 
      2016-GC37 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 54 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Fitch Rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6; Outlook Stable
























NEW YORK, Dec 15, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6, Commercial 
      Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-P6. Fitch has assigned 
      ratings and Rating Outlooks. A full list of rating actions follows at 
      the end of this ratings action commentary.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are slightly worse than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively, are 
      slightly worse than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages of 1.20x and 
      105.5%. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the conduit portion of the 
      pool (net of investment-grade credit-opinion loans) are 1.14x and 
      112.2%, respectively.


                                        








Diverse Pool: The 10 largest loans comprise 44.9% of the pool, which is 
      better than the YTD average of 54.5% for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals. The largest loan in the pool is 8 Times Square & 1460 Broadway at 
      8.21% of the pool. The respective loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) scores of 319 and 375 are better than 
      the YTD averages of 421 and 494 for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals.


                                        








Below-Average Amortization: Eleven loans comprising 42.3% of the pool 
      are full interest-only. This is worse than the average when compared to 
      other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 23.3% for 2015 and 32.1% 
      for YTD 2016. Additionally, there are 19 loans comprising 28.4% of the 
      pool which are partial interest-only, which is better than the 2015 and 
      YTD 2016 averages of 43.1% and 34.7%. Overall, the pool is scheduled to 
      pay down by 8.8% which is worse than average when compared with the 
      averages of 11.7% for 2015 and 10.5% YTD 2016 for other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      deals.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.32% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI), for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P6 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.


                                        








Fitch assigns ratings and Ratings Outlooks to the transaction as follows:

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided “as is” without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.


                                        








For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia

Fitch to Rate CGCMT 2016-GC37 Commercial Mortgage Trust; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate CGCMT 2016-GC37 Commercial Mortgage Trust; Presale Issued
    





April 05, 2016 01:49 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2016-GC37 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$21,993,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,474,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$175,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$227,379,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,462,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$526,255,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,868,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,947,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,868,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$106,814,000b class EC 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,999,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,210,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,210,000ac class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,105,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,816,000c class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 1, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $7,816,000 class G 
      or the $28,657,724 class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 54 loans secured by 64 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $697.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, 
      The Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.6%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool has higher leverage statistics than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average (WA) Fitch 
      DSCR of 1.04x is below both the YTD 2016 average of 1.14x and the 2015 
      average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch LTV of 115.3% is above both the 
      YTD 2016 average of 108.7% and the 2015 average of 109.3%.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 56.1% of the 
      pool by balance. This is in line with the YTD 2016 average of 56.2% and 
      greater than the 2015 average of 49.3%. The pool's average concentration 
      resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 419, which is comparable 
      to the YTD 2016 average of 430, but worse than the 2015 average of 367.
    

      Good Primary Market Exposure: Seven out of the top 10 properties 
      totaling 39.7% of the pool are located in the central business districts 
      of primary markets including New York, Denver, Los Angeles and Austin.
    

      Above-Average Hotel Exposure: There are six loans, representing 16.2% of 
      the pool, that consist of hotel properties, plus a mixed-use building 
      with a hotel component that makes up 5.7% of the pool. This is higher 
      than the YTD 2016 average of 14.9% and the 2015 average hotel 
      concentration of 17%. Hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 
      2016-GC37 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 54 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
