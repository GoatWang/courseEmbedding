At an offering price of $18.75 per share, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us from the sale of our common stock in the offering will be approximately $24.0
million (or approximately $27.7 million if the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional shares of common stock from us), after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including but not limited to, contributing capital to Community Bank
and supporting organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions of whole banking
institutions or branch locations, should appropriate acquisition opportunities
arise. Currently, we do not have any agreements, arrangements or understandings
regarding any possible acquisitions.


The Bank faces strong competition in the attraction of deposits and in the
origination of loans. Its most direct competition for deposits and loans comes
from other banks, savings and loan associations and tax-exempt federal and state
credit unions located in its primary market area. There are currently 13
FDIC-insured depository institutions operating in the tri-county area including
subsidiaries of several large, regional and national bank holding companies.
According to statistics compiled by the FDIC, the Bank was ranked first in
deposit market share in the tri-county area as of June 30, 2012, the latest date
for which such data is available. The Bank faces additional significant
competition for customers’ funds from mutual funds, brokerage firms, and other
financial institutions. The Bank competes for loans by providing competitive
rates, flexibility of terms and service, including customer access to senior 
decision makers. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety 
of account types, convenient office locations and competitive rates. Other 
services offered include tax deferred retirement programs, brokerage services 
through an affiliation with Community Wealth Advisors, cash management services 
and safe deposit boxes. The Bank has used targeted direct mail, print and online
advertising and community outreach to increase its market share of deposits, 
loans and other services in its market area. It provides ongoing training for 
its staff in an attempt to ensure high-quality service.


Company Description
Tri-County Financial Corporation, headquartered in Waldorf, Maryland and
organized in 1989, is the bank holding company for Community Bank, a
Maryland-chartered commercial bank subject to supervision and regulation by the
Federal Reserve and the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation


 (the
“Maryland Commissioner”). Community Bank was founded in 1950 as Tri-County
Building and Loan Association of Waldorf, a mutual savings and loan association.
In 1986, the Bank converted to a federal stock savings bank and, in 1997,
converted to a Maryland-chartered commercial bank and adopted its current name.

Community Bank provides an array of financial products and services for
businesses and retail customers primarily through its ten full-service offices
located in Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s Counties in Southern Maryland (the
“tri-county area”) and one full-service branch office in King George County,
Virginia. In addition, Community Bank originates loans through loan production
offices in La Plata and Prince Frederick, Maryland and Fredericksburg, Virginia.
Community Bank focuses its commercial business generation efforts on targeting
small and medium sized businesses with revenues between $5.0 million and $35.0
million headquartered in Southern Maryland and in King George County and
Fredericksburg, Virginia. In addition, Community Bank services the retail
banking needs of the communities surrounding its 11 full-service branch
locations with a full array of retail deposit and loan products. Community
Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) to the maximum
permitted by law.

Effective October 18, 2013, Community Bank will change its name to “Community
Bank of the Chesapeake.” This new name reflects Community Bank’s recent
expansion into the Northern Neck of Virginia and will align the Bank’s name with
its strategy of being the premier community banking institution throughout the
Chesapeake Bay region. In addition, Tri-County Financial will change its name to
“The Community Financial Corporation,” to better align the parent company name
with the bank name.
