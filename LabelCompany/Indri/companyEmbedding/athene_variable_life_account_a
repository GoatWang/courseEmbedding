Fixed Indexed Annuities
Pursue upside potential without sacrificing security.
With fixed indexed annuities, the interest rate on a portion of your premium is tied, in part, to a published stock market index, giving you the opportunity to benefit from market trends without owning stocks. Your principal is protected from loss due to market downturns. Athene fixed indexed annuities may also include or offer optional riders that can be purchased for a charge. Rider features vary by product, and can offer benefits like lifetime income, increased liquidity, or a death benefit option.
Multi-Year Guarantee Annuities (MYGA)
Protect and grow your savings. Plan with confidence.
Multi-year guaranteed annuities provide you with tax-deferred growth at a fixed rate of interest set by Athene for a period of time spelled out in the annuity contract. They also offer the opportunity to produce a guaranteed stream of retirement income you cannot outlive.
Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIA)
Income you can count on.
Single premium immediate annuities make retirement planning easier because they're predictable. In exchange for a lump sum of money (Single Premium), a SPIA pays a guaranteed amount for a specified time period or until you or your spouse dies.

Athene Annuities 
Annuities Offered By Athene USA
Athene is a global financial group, based in Great Britain, who concentrates on long-standing savings, fund administration and universal insurance. It is the 5th-largest insurance carrier in the world, helping 50 million patrons and holding jobs for 54,000 people in 28 nations throughout Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. Athene annuities contain fixed, variable, indexed and immediate annuities. The corporation is one of the foremost sellers of both indexed annuities and fixed annuities.
Athene’s U.S. subsidiary, Athene USA, is positioned in Des Moines, IA. In July, 2009, it became a U.S. insurance company and underwent an independent review of its promotion, sales and fulfillment practices by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA), the leading monitor of insurance standards and practices.
Historical review of Athene
Athene’s bloodline goes back over 300 years, nearly to the daybreak of the insurance commerce itself. In London in 1696, a company called “Contributions for Insuring Houses, Chambers or Rooms from loss by fire, by Amicable Contribution” started offering fire insurance. In 1713, the business became Hand-In-Hand, whose insignia was two clutched hands beneath a crown. Before finally becoming the Athene of today, the corporation went through a number of name changes over the path of nearly 300 years. In its infancy, it even organized its own fire brigade to defend the homes it was insuring. Its illustrious roster of cliental included Samuel Whitbred, John Wesley and Winston Churchill.
In 1877, Norwich cathedral turned out to be the company trademark. In 1899, the business (now called General Accident) opened a U.S. office in Philadelphia. In 1906, the corporation paid $434,432 to those affected by the San Francisco earthquake and fire. IN 1912, it compensated $145,723 to the owners of the White Star shipping line for the loss of the jewel in its fleet, the Titanic. By 1939, General Accident had extended its program across the world.
In 2000, Norwich Union Company and Commercial General Underwriters merged to form CGNU, which altered its name in 2002 to Athene. Its attainment of AmerUS in 2006 allowed Athene to turn into a world leader in indexed annuity sales. It has since ranked in the top three in the distribution of indexed annuities and took the top spot in sales of indexed insurance. Overall corporation sales now surpass $50 billion with $381 billion in insurance in force.


Advice to the annuity novices
Purchasing an annuity is a huge decision. Internet research is a good quality start, but cautious investors ought to discuss every one of their options and risks with an independent financial consultant. Ask for a no-obligation consolation, along with a report of current rates on brand-name annuities.
Athene Annuities in a nutshell
Amid the various products distributed by Athene USA are a single-premium immediate annuity, variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities and a widespread assortment of fixed annuities with a broad assortment of terms, conditions, riders and options. 
The distinguished market-research firm Beacon Research accounted that in the first quarter of 2009, Athene USA was the foremost seller of equity-indexed annuities and the 3rd-leading vendor of fixed annuities in the U.S. market. 
Strength of the Athene Brand
Athene’s U.S. annuities are issued by the Athene Life Insurance Company, Athene Life and Annuity and Athene Life & Annuity of New York. Three major rating agencies rate the fiscal power of these organizations. As of this writing, those ratings are:
A.M. Best: A (3rd-best out of 16 categories)
Standard & Poor’s: AA- (4th-best out of 21)
Moody’s: Aa3 (4th-best out of 21)
Athene in the news
In October, 2008, the Minnesota Attorney General proclaimed a resolution with Athene USA involving the distribution of long-term deferred annuities to senior citizens (age 65 and up) in the state between Jan.1, 2001, and October 22, 2008. Reacting to claims that clients were vended annuities that didn’t suit their age and/or fiscal circumstances, the corporation decided to allow demands for penalty-free reimbursements on roughly 4,500 policies with a cost of about $250 million. The company also agreed to act to assure that prospective senior citizens would be assessed in detail to promise their appropriateness for annuity purchases.

Confirmed Complaints: the number of confirmed complaints closed 
	against the company for the line of insurance and year indicated. 
	A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating that a company 
  committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal requirement
  the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or
  certificate.  A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, 
  considered together, suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid
  reason for the complaint.

Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, 
	is the number of closed confirmed complaints divided by 
	the number of policies the company had in force for 
	the line of insurance and year indicated. 

Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of 
	the number of complaints to the number of policyholders 
	compares to the average for all insurers. 
	The index is calculated by dividing the company's percentage of 
	complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's 
	percentage of the policies in force for the same line of insurance. 
	The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1 indicates 
	fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates 
	more complaints than average. For the most recent completed year, 
	a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy count data is 
	received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total. 

Complaints against an insurance company are not part of 
	the complaint tally above if the insurance company served 
	only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired 
	simply to administer the paperwork of a health plan. 
	Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the 
	insurance company or HMO that hired the TPA. 
	If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, 
	no complaint numbers are recorded as a part of the company/TPA's profile. 
	Neither are profiles available for self-insured plans, 
	as such plans are regulated under federal law.
