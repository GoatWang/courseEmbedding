Abstract
This review of the state of research on product development as of the mid-1990s finds that it is quite fragmented, and sets out to create a framework by which to view the literature. Most empirical research can be grouped into three views of the nature of the product development process: rational plan, communication web, or disciplined problem solving. Based on the prior research, a model of success factors is developed, which highlights the value of various stakeholders, or agents, and distinguishes between success in the process and a successful product.        The focus on product development as successful when rationally planned identified the value of organizational characteristics such as cross-functional teams and product champions, and the importance of market conditions. Research on the role of communication, within the product development team and externally, focused on the importance of a communication strategy and the need for gatekeepers and boundary spanners on the team. The disciplined problem solving approach emerged first in studies of Japanese product development processes. This approach requires strong leadership and a clear vision. With a clear goal in mind, and input from various functions, there is also autonomy to experiment, going through multiple problem solving iterations.          These research streams overlap, and from that commonality a model is developed herein that emphasizes the importance of such factors as cross-functional teams, strong leadership, resource availability and information flow. Three issues for future product development research are (1) the role of senior managers; (2) the organization of work (e.g., improvision vs planning); and (3) the connections and dependencies between the development process, market factors, effective products and financial performance.

Customer Reviews










February 25, 2016Standing Sun LIVE presentsKirby Brown& Kathleen SieckAbout Kirby Brown:Kirby Brown was born in East Texas and moved to rural Damascus, Arkansas at age two. His formative years on the farm kept him occupied bottle-feeding calves, fishing for crappie, and shelling peas. His taste for music was also fostered here, being exposed to gospel, bluegrass, and the classic country his grandfather would strum in the evenings.After the divorce of his parents, Kirby and his dad, a closeted poet, would spend visits diving into film, music, and the nuances of American Poetry. He became as much interested in reading Whitman and Frost as he was in grade school or spending time with his friends. This fresh form of expression would become the bedrock on which Kirbyâ€™s artistic life would be built.When he was nineteen, his first true love and his best friend died in separate incidents. Through the long process of grieving, Kirby found an outlet for his pain in writing songs. Fearing that he too might die before his time in that same small town, Kirby moved to Dallas and bunked with fellow musicians. An offer to tag along on tour put Kirby on an eight-month road trip through what seemed like every town in America. Immediately after coming off the road, Kirby was offered an opening slot at House of Blues in Dallas. Soon after, Kirby released his first independent record, Child Of Calamity.He found a new stride and began sharing bills and festivals with artists including Willie Nelson, The Flaming Lips, Leon Russell, and The Avett Brothers.About Kathleen Sieck:"I love where we come from. I love that I know it won't rain from April to October, I love fresh tamales in December, I love the pre-seven am cowboy rush at the Longhorn cafe in town, I love the grapevines climbing in clean rows up the flanks of the hillsides, rust-red beneath the autumn mist. I love simple country music - not the kind on the radio, but the kind you used to hear growing up in the dusty bench seat of the ranch truck, with the head of an australian shepherd resting on the open window sill. The kind of music where Mr. Cowboy Man seemed like he just pulled up right next to you, no frills, to tell you a little something about life - while wearing his awesome vintage 1950's jean jacket and sporting an old nylon string guitar. I write music that reflects my life as a Californian, as a Christian, as a mother and a lover and a wife. I write music to go on a back porch, mostly, and sometimes a front porch or a church or a bar or someplace, but mostly I write music about the toils and exultations of this beautiful and difficult life we are in.It's a short life, so we should sing while we have the breath for it."Doors open 7pm/Show starts 7:30$12 Standing Room / $17 Reserved SeatingFood by Tipsters Catering Food Truck!All Ages Show!Tickets areWILL CALL and will not be mailed.
