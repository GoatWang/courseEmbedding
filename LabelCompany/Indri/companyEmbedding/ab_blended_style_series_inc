The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryN/AFund FamilyN/ANet AssetsN/AYTD ReturnN/AYieldN/AMorningstar RatingN/A1Inception DateInvalid DateFund OperationsLast DividendN/ALast Cap GainN/AHoldings TurnoverN/AAverage for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseLTDRXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)N/AN/AProspectus Net Expense RatioN/AN/AProspectus Gross Expense RatioN/AN/AMax 12b1 FeeN/AN/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/AN/AMax Deferred Sales LoadN/AN/A3 Yr Expense ProjectionN/AN/A5 Yr Expense ProjectionN/AN/A10 Yr Expense ProjectionN/AN/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
