Beaumont Financial Partners — Investment Methodology
















Investment MethodologyInvestment CommitteeAsset Allocation StrategyDominant Benefit Theory Ongoing Economic Analysis




Investment Methodology
We believe that a “top down” asset allocation driven investment approach with superior global macroeconomic insight leads to top tier risk-adjusted investment results. Our competitive advantage lies in our ability to identify and select specific investments that will benefit from these value creating themes and construct customized portfolios to match client’s investment objectives.
Our methodology starts with considering all asset classes from a global macroeconomic standpoint to determine themes that we think will offer the best prospects on a risk/reward basis. Included in our screening are factors such as historical market data, global demographic analysis, balance of trade and national debt comparisons, budget/deficit calculations, currency purchasing power parity analysis, global interest rates; and general supply/demand analytics across a wide spectrum of commodities and materials. This work generates the themes/ sectors that we believe present the best investment opportunities for our clients and shape our rigorous asset allocation modeling.
Once these themes and related sectors are identified, we do more fundamental or “bottom up” research and analysis on the specific investments (i.e., individual securities, mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds, etc.). For the core equity component of client portfolios, we tend to focus on companies that have a history of generating significant free cash flow and sharing that cash flow with investors via their dividends. We prefer companies that have a long history of increasing their dividend annually and have a modest dividend payout ratio. In sectors that are more speculative, our analysis might focus on the value of a company’s assets and the discount these assets are valued at relative to the company’s stock price. Other value catalysts we look for include management changes, stock buyback plans, sectors that are consolidating, mispriced stocks due to market overreactions, and improving business models.
	      Portfolios are constructed by the relationship managers using investments identified by the investment committee. Each client portfolio is designed to fit within the risk tolerance, time horizons and other client criteria so that the allocation of the portfolio brings comfort to each individual. Periodic client portfolio reviews monitor client allocations to ensure allocations are appropriate. Through this process we strive to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns to each client.

Investment Committee
Beaumont’s Investment Committee typically meets weekly. Each session begins with a discussion of the macroeconomic environment with particular attention to major developments or news since the prior meeting. A review of the firm’s positions (by asset class and category) follows. The final portion of the meetings is devoted to specific buy, sell, hold decisions result from the meeting’s deliberations and advance materials.

Beaumont Financial Partners — Services




















Services
We surround our core expertise in investment management with in-depth, in-house tax preparation and financial planning services. In those areas, we operate much like a primary care physician. We listen carefully. We perform in-depth diagnostic analysis, prescribe a knowledge-based “treatment” plan and coordinate its implementation. In doing so, we work collegially with our client’s other advisors or, if requested, we will introduce them to specialists in myriad disciplines. 
Investment Management
Beaumont’s main business is managing investments for our clients. We are a fee-based advisory firm specializing in macroeconomic analysis as well as fundamental equity selection. For more information, please go to Investment Methodology. 
Estate and Financial Planning
We believe that everyone should plan before they invest. “You got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going, because you might not get there.”— Yogi Berra. All of Beaumont’s relationship managers have financial, income, and estate planning expertise; we form our portfolios based on each clients’ planning needs.
Income Tax Preparation
We prepare returns for about 40% of our clients. If an established tax preparer relationship is in place we do not seek to destroy this but rather will work collegially with your accountant. However, many clients like “one stop shopping” the ease and cost efficiency of in-house tax preparation. 
Consolidated Investment Statements and Reviews
Most clients have never seen all of their investments aggregated and categorized in one report. Beaumont’s proprietary reporting system will give you year to date performance on each security, each account, and each group (i.e., personal/trust versus retirement accounts) as well as all accounts totaled together. We also show your beginning basis and ending asset allocation and compare this against your long term allocation strategy. All of this information helps us monitor and measure your progress. 
Qualified Plan Consulting
There are many advantages to implementing a retirement plan. Whether you have Schedule C income, a professional practice, your own business, or access to other qualified plans, Beaumont seeks to optimize the tax advantages and savings opportunities available to you. Many clients ask us to manage their outside retirement plans as part of their combined asset allocation.
Strategic Business Alliances
Beaumont maintains multiple strategic business alliances with firms having recognized expertise in the following areas:

Corporate Trustees
 Venture Capital
 Private Equity
 Banking and Credit
 Mortgage Banking
 Life Insurance
 Property and Casualty Insurance
 Mergers and Acquisitions
 Consulting Services to family and closely held businesses
 Legal (including residential purchase and sale, corporate matters, general litigation, and family law)

Our intention in maintaining these alliances is to provide our clients with the opportunity to access the finest resources available when a product or service may be appropriate for their situation. To maintain total objectivity, Beaumont receives no compensation from any of our strategic business alliances.
