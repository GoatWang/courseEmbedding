Optical Transceivers

Transceivers and Transponders for Datacom and Telecom ApplicationsFinisar's broad product selection and innovative technology have made us the optical module manufacturer of choice for all major networking equipment vendors worldwide. We have taken a leading role in transforming the datacommunications and telecommunications equipment market from utilizing discrete optical components to leveraging the design and pay-as-you-grow flexibility offered by pluggable modules. Our products are fully compliant with Ethernet, Fibre Channel, Infiniband, SONET/SDH/OTN, CPRI and PON standards and operate at data rates in excess of 100 Gb/s. They are capable of distances ranging from very short reach within a data center to campus, access, metro, and long-haul reaches. They feature outstanding performance over extended voltage and temperature ranges, while minimizing jitter, electromagnetic interference (EMI) and power dissipation.
Finisar's Patented Digital DiagnosticsFinisar's transceivers feature a microprocessor and diagnostics interface that provide performance information on the data link. Users can remotely monitor - in real-time - received optical power, transmitted optical power, laser bias current, transceiver input voltage and transceiver temperature of any transceiver in the network. These digital diagnostic functions provide network managers with a highly accurate, cost-effective tool for implementing reliable performance monitoring.

					Full Description



Finisar Corporation (Finisar), incorporated on October 1, 1999, is a provider of optical subsystems and components that are used in data communication and telecommunication applications. The Company's optical subsystems consist of transmitters, receivers, transceivers, transponders and active optical cables, which provide the fundamental optical-electrical or optoelectronic interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in these networks, including the switches, routers, and servers used in wireline networks, as well as the antennas and base stations used in wireless networks. These products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuits and optoelectronic packaging to provide a means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than one gigabit per second (Gbps), to more than 100 Gbps, over distances of less than 10 meters to more than 2,000 kilometers, using a range of network protocols and physical configurations.Finisar supplies optical transceivers and transponders that allow point-to-point communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or, bundled with multiplexing technologies, can be used to supply multi-terabit per second (Tbps), bandwidths using approximately 100 or more wavelengths on the same fiber. The Company also provides products known as wavelength selective switches (WSS). WSS are switches that are used to dynamically switch network traffic from one optical fiber to multiple other fibers without first converting the optical signal to an electronic signal. WSS products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards that plug into a system chassis referred to as a reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM). The Company's line of optical components consists of packaged lasers and photodetectors for data communication and telecommunication applications. Its manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and it utilizes internal sources for many of the key components used in making its products, including lasers, photodetectors and integrated circuits (ICs). It sells its products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of storage systems, networking equipment and telecommunication equipment, and to their contract manufacturers.The Company's optical subsystems and components are integrated into its customers' systems and used for fiber optics-based data communication and telecommunication networks. Finisar's family of optical subsystem products are based on the Ethernet, fiber channel, optical transport network (OTN) and synchronous optical networking/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH). Its optical subsystem products perform various functions with data integrity and support a range of protocols, transmission speeds, fiber types, wavelengths, transmission distances, physical configurations and software enhancements. Its optical subsystem products include a microprocessor with embedded software that provides customers real-time monitoring of transmitted and received optical power, temperature, drive current, and other link parameters for each port in their systems.For data communication applications that rely on the Fiber Channel standard, the Company provides a range of optical subsystems for transmission applications at 1 to 16 Gbps. For data communication applications that rely on the Ethernet standard, it provides a range of optical subsystems for transmitting signals at 1 to 100 Gbps using the small form-factor pluggable (SFP), SFP+, 10 gigabit small form factor pluggable (XFP), X2, quad small form-factor pluggable (QSFP), QSFP28, C form-factor pluggable (CFP), CFP2, CFP4 and other form factors. For OTN and SONET/SDH-based telecommunication applications, it supplies optical subsystems that are capable of transmitting at 0.155, 0.622, 2.5, 10, 40, 100 and 200 Gbps. It also offers a line of optical subsystems for telecommunication applications using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technologies. Its products include coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM), transceivers in the SFP form factor and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), transceivers in the SFP, SFP+, XFP, and CFP form factors. These products include both fixed wavelength transceivers and tunable transceivers that are capable of dynamically tuning across a range of wavelengths in the C- and L-Bands.The Company has access to technology for the manufacture of a number of active and passive optical components, including vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs); Fabry-Perot (FP), lasers; distributed feedback (DFB), lasers; tunable lasers; positive intrinsic negative (PIN), detectors; integrated waveguide detectors; Mach Zehnder Modulators; fused fiber couplers; isolators; filters; polarization beam combiners; interleavers, and amplifiers. These optical components are used internally in the manufacture of its optical subsystems. The Company sells some of these components in the merchant market to other subsystems manufacturers. It also offers products used in building fiber-to-the-home/curb networks and for parallel optics applications, such as backplanes for switches and routers.Finisar offers WSS and ROADM linecard products for wavelength management in DWDM telecommunication networks. These capabilities are made possible in part through the use of its liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), technology, similar to that used in miniature projectors. This technology provides a WSS capable of operating on both 50 and 100 gigahertz (GHz) International Telecommunications Union (ITU), grids, based on its Flexgrid technology. In addition, this LCoS-based architecture offers the capability for in-service upgrades of functionality and integration of additional system functionality, including route and select, drop and continue, channel monitoring, and channel contouring features. Its WSS and ROADM linecard product offering ranges from 1x2, 1x4 and 1x9 products up to higher output fiber port counts in its 1x23 and 2x1x20 products.The Company competes with Foxconn, JDS Uniphase, Oclaro, Sumitomo, CoAdna, Oplink and Nistica.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
