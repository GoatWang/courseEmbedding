How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Dailey Paul L carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Dailey Paul L currently holds license 0000942 (Construction Financial Officer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Dailey Paul L



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Dailey Paul L



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Dailey Paul L



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

I tried different amounts to see if I was putting too much or too little on, and nothing seemed to help. My hair would look wet and feel greasy until I washed it again, which would then repeat the process. It somehow made my hair feel much less clean than before I washed it every time. I really tried this many times before finally giving up and returning it. Luckily that was a quick and easy process so I can have good hair care again. Only plus side was the conditioner did detangle and slightly reversed some of the super greasy/heavy feeling left by the shampoo.Hair Type:Wavy HairBottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/27/2017 5.0Great product - totally smoothes thick medium length hair!

No. 6562.

Harold Brown, Boston, Mass., for appellee.
Before ALDRICH, Chief Judge, McENTEE, Circuit Judge, and CAFFREY, District Judge.
McENTEE, Circuit Judge.


1
Plaintiff, Paul L. Flanagan, d/b/a Paul L. Flanagan and Sons, is a trucker and hauler of sand, gravel, stone and other similar materials.  In the spring of 1963, defendant, Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., engaged a general contractor to construct a parking lot for it at its plant in Needham, Massachusetts.  There was a hill or ledge on this site which had to be removed at the beginning of the job.  Although the general contractor was obliged to level off the hill, he was not required under his contract to truck the ledge material away.  Plaintiff alleges that on May 27, 1963, which is the date the parking lot job was commenced, the defendant made an oral agreement with him whereby he agreed to supply the trucks and haul this ledge material away and the defendant agreed to pay him for this work at the rate of $13 per hour per truck.  Plaintiff proceeded immediately with the hauling operation which extended over two periods: May 27 to June 10, 1963 and June 17 to July 1, 1963.  In the performance of this work he used his own trucks and trucks rented from others, as was his practice on jobs of this size.  Plaintiff claimed that the entire job took a total of 1932 1/2 truck hours work for which he billed defendant at the rate of $13 an hour.  This amount, plus an item of $145 for bulldozer hire, which was not disputed, came to $25,267.50.  Defendant refused to pay this bill.  Whereupon plaintiff brought suit in the Massachusetts Superior Court for breach of contract.  The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on the ground of diversity.  The jury found for the plaintiff in the full amount of his claim.  This is an appeal by the defendant from the judgment entered by the district court based on the jury verdict.  Defendant's principal ground of appeal is that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of the best evidence rule; that this evidence should have been excluded and a verdict should have been directed for the defendant.


2
Plaintiff offered the following evidence in support of his claim, all of which he alleged is based on daily truck hour slips on tally sheets made at the site of the job which recorded the number of trucks on the job and the number of hours worked by each truck: (1) Exhibit A in the declaration filed in this case, which he says is a summary of the data contained in the invoices and the tally sheets.  (2) A number of photostatic copies of bills and invoices sent to plaintiff by other truckers for the rental of their trucks on this job.  (3) Copies of two bills sent by plaintiff to defendant, one in the amount of $12,521 for work done during the first period and the other reflecting the total amount of $25,267.50 due for both periods.  The contents of these two bills is identical with the claim set forth in Schedule A of the plaintiff's declaration (supra).


3
Plaintiff testified that the data contained in the above exhibits is the same as that contained in the tally sheets.  In the course of the trial when plaintiff was asked whether the information contained in these exhibits was the same as that contained in the tally sheets, defendant objected on the ground that this was secondary evidence and thus was barred by the best evidence rule.  At this point, the trial court inquired as to whether the plaintiff had those tally sheets, to which he replied that he knew he had some at home but was not sure whether he had them all.  The court then suggested that he bring in those that he had.  Later in the course of the trial this line of inquiry was resumed by plaintiff's counsel and again defendant objected.  The court allowed plaintiff's testimony that the information contained in the invoices 'checked out' with that contained in the tally sheets.  The defendant adequately objected.  None of the tally sheets were ever produced at the trial.


4
It is well settled that the best evidence that is obtainable in the circumstances of the case must be adduced to prove any disputed fact.  United States v. Alexander, 326 F.2d 736 (4th Cir. 1964).  Here, the plaintiff's claim is based on performance of the work.  The best evidence of his performance is the truck hour records (tally sheets).  Those records were made for the very purpose of recording this performance.  Instead of producing these records plaintiff offered the secondary evidence of their content enumerated above.  In proving the terms of a writing, which terms are material to the issues in the case, the original writing must be produced unless it is shown to be unavailable for some reason other than the serious fault of the proponent.  McCormick, Evidence 196 (1954).  Upon a proper showing of the unavailability of the original writing, secondary evidence of its contents may be received.  However, secondary evidence of the content of the original is not admissible unless the proponent of the testimony shows that a reasonable and diligent search has been made for the original without success.  See Simpson & Co. v. Dall, 3 Wall. 460, 70 U.S. 460, 475, 18 L. Ed. 265 (1865); Toho Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. v. American Pres.  Lines, Ltd., 265 F.2d 418, 423, (2d Cir. 1959).  See also Fauci v. Mulready, 337 Mass. 532, 540, 150 N.E.2d 286 (1958).


5
From a careful examination of the evidence in this case we feel there is not sufficient proof that the original tally sheets in question were in fact unavailable or that a reasonable search had been made to find them.  Although plaintiff stated that it was not his practice to keep these tally sheets after checking them with the truckers' invoices, he did testify on several occasions that he knew he had some of them at home and that he would bring into court what he had.  This he did not do.  It is also apparent from the evidence that plaintiff had tally sheets in his possession when he conferred with officials of the defendant in June 1963, at which time he knew there was a dispute concerning the work and payment for it.  Although plaintiff stated in open court that he would make a search for the tally sheets there is little if any evidence that he in fact made such a search and there is no evidence at all as to the extent of any such search.  There is no universal or fixed rule that determines the sufficiency of the proof required to show that a reasonable or diligent search has been made.  Each case is governed in large measure by its own particular facts and circumstances.  He who seeks to introduce secondary evidence must show that he has used all reasonable means to obtain the original, i.e., such search as the nature of the case would suggest.  Simpson & Co. v. Dall, supra, 3 Wall. 460, 70 U.S. at 475; Rash v. Peoples Deposit Bank & Trust Co., 91 F. Supp. 825, 827 (D.C.E.D.Ky.), affirmed 192 F.2d 470 (6 Cir., 1950).  The best evidence rule should not be applied as a mere technicality.  But where the missing original writings in dispute are the very foundation of the claim, which is the situation in this case, more strictness in proof is required than where the writings are only involved collaterally.  See 32A C.J.S. Evidence 842 and cases cited thereunder.  Plaintiff failed to satisfy this requirement.


6
Moreover, under the best evidence rule, in order to permit proof by secondary evidence of the allegedly lost or otherwise unavailable original writing, the trial judge must make preliminary findings that the original had become unavailable, otherwise than through the fault of the proponent of the testimony and that reasonable search had been made for it.  Fauci v. Mulready,supra, 337 Mass. at 540, 150 N.E.2d 286.  The record in this case does not reveal that the trial court made these necessary preliminary findings.


7
In a similar case decided by this court it was held that an itemized bill sent to defendant was inadmissible in evidence where the bill was made from work sheets which were not produced at the trial and where there was no evidence that these original work sheets were lost or unavailable.  John Irving Shoe Co. v. Dugan, 93 F.2d 711 (1st Cir. 1937).


8
Ordinarily prejudicial error with respect to damages should require that the new trial be on damages only.  However, in this case the whole case depended largely upon plaintiff's credibility.  The record was left in such condition that he was never called upon to explain the absence of his records, his search, if any, therefor, or why, when he knew from the beginning that there was a dispute, he had not preserved them, if, in fact, he had not.  Actually, plaintiff has never denied that the records no longer exist.  In view of the fact that examination of the records might well corroborate the defendant's account, rather than plaintiff's, as to other issues between the parties, we believe that justice would be best served by ordering an entirely new trial.


9
We find it unnecessary to decide any other questions raised in the case.


10
The judgment of the district court will be vacated, the verdict set aside and the case remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.

Trump's Obama Derangement Syndrome isn't really about Obama

Full-blown Obama Derangement Syndrome (ODS), seen in the spew and spittle mouthed by the insecure and egomaniacal occupant of the White House, is not simply a Trumpian affliction. We watched Republicans dig in to subvert and block “the black guy” from the moment he took office. Joe Wilson’s “you lie” hurled at President Obama during a joint session of Congress, ditching decades of decorum, was more than a dog whistle: It was a signal to a significant number of Americans that a black man in the “white” house would not be accepted. That’s ironic given that this nation is now headed to hell in a hand basket, led by the most lying liar in our history.
ODS continued to play out during Obama’s presidential years, culminating in the blocking of Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court nominee. No longer in office, President Obama is now Trump’s excuse for whatever ills he and his crime-klan have brought upon themselves.
But frankly, it has less to do with Barack Obama himself (or his wife) than it does with what I’d call “uppity negro-itis." Had any other black person, male or female, been elected to the most powerful position in the world, their fate would have been the same.
Barack Obama is simply the most visible global symbol of black achievement, and from the point of view of those who hold onto white supremacist thinking, all black achievement must be stifled, smashed, trashed, and vilified.
Don’t buy the “economic anxiety” argument you read about daily in newspapers and hear about from pundits and bloggers. That just masks the deep-rooted fear and loathing of all things black that don’t stay where they are supposed to be. 
Trump and others in power know very well how to throw red meat to the salivating masses stewing in racial resentment. Sure, they have black people they embrace—“white seal of approval blacks” who know their place, the Clarence Thomases and Ben Carsons. Those black folks who dare to proudly be who they are become instant targets. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is a recent example of the “blame-a-black” syndrome which is still being played out for all of us to see.

Donald Trump’s Saturday morning Twitter flurry, which included not one, or two, but three seperate tweets attacking Hillary Clinton should serve as a reminder that there’s one term that gets left out all too often when describing Trump. Sure. He’s a pompous jackass. Absolutely, he’s a know-nothing idiot who has not the first clue about history, or science, or the lives that are lived by people who weren’t born with a silver spoon in every orifice. But there’s one term that sums Donald Trump up better than all the rest.
He’s a coward.
Nine months after the election, Trump is still hiding behind HIllary’s skirts every time he feels the least bit of heat. 
xSo many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2017

So many people? Yeah. Name two. Look at that. How craven. How gutless. How weak-kneed, spineless, and chicken-hearted. Lily-livered. Cowardly.
This eagerness to throw stones at others is the perfect synopsis of a man who’s reached 71 years without ever doing a hard day’s work. Someone who never known a single day of need. Someone whose every moment has been coddled and protected. Who never had to face the results of any decision without a whipping boy kept handy. Someone whose tiny finger always points anywhere but at himself.
This week, Sean Spicer opted out of daily defending the indefensible. So did Mark Corallo, the spokesperson for Trump’s legal team. And while Trump found at least one more person willing to stand between himself and acknowledging the truth, the pardon talk shows that Trump realizes this long buffet of self indulgence is finally getting ready to close. 
Let’s read what some pundits have to say.

Saturday open thread for night owls: Six months after women's marches, resisters still engaged

Crowd-sourced tallies say 4 million women marched at more than 650 U.S. locations on January 21.











Crowd-sourced tallies say 4 million women marched at more than 650 U.S. locations on January 21.


At CommonDreams, Julia Conley writes—Six Months After Women's March, Invigorated Resistance Sees Impact:

A new Pew Research poll finds that since President Donald Trump's inauguration, Americans, particularly women, have become more engaged in the political system by contacting elected officials, attending demonstrations, and even paying more attention to political news.



Fifty-eight percent of women reported they had become more engaged in politics since Donald Trump entered office, compared with 46 percent of men. Fifteen percent of total respondents said they've attended a political event or protest since the election, and more than two-thirds of this group said they've attended anti-Trump events.
The Pew poll was released exactly six months after the historic Women's March, which was comprised of demonstrations all over the world and which many regard as the beginning of the anti-Trump resistance movement.
The Women's March originated with the idea of one woman, retired attorney Teresa Shook of Hawaii, who created a Facebook page the day after the 2016 election, calling for a March in the nation's capitol following Donald Trump's inauguration day. Within hours more than 10,000 people had agreed to participate.
The originally hoped-for Women's March on Washington in the nation's capitol drew an estimated 725,000 marchers. But organizers from across the country gathered both large and small crowds, resulting in more than four million total participants according to two researchers at the University of Denver and the University of Connecticut, who tallied the numbers through crowdsourcing.

 BLAST FROM THE PAST
At Daily Kos on this date in 2008—Andrea Mitchell Lectures Us On Media Responsibility:

Not that she doesn't have a point ... on MSNBC this morning last night, referring to the footage of Obama hitting a basket in front of the troops, and the other trip photos, Andrea Mitchell said something like 




Let me just say something about the message management. He didn't have reporters with him, he didn't have a press pool, he didn't do a press conference while he was on the ground either in Afghanistan or Iraq. What you're seeing is not reporters brought in, you're seeing selected pictures taken by the military, questions by the military and what some would call fake interviews because they're not interviews from a journalist.




Interesting point. Andrea's right when she says the military ought not to be in the business of journalism, and we should be skeptical of what we are seeing.
I'm sure this emphasis on skepticism is exactly what she said when reporters were embedded during the war. And when the statue of Saddam came down (the wide shot showing hardly anyone there, but the close-up making it seem like a spontaneous crowd had gathered.)
And this is what she said when McCain walked around the Iraqi market in a flak jacket without the shots of his guard, repeating the point day and night (like now) so that everyone understood it.
I'm almost certain that Andrea warned us to be skeptical when George Bush maneuvered the aircraft carrier for a better backdrop for his Mission Accomplished stunt.

Theodore R. Davis's illustration of President Johnson's impeachment trial in the Senate in 1868 as published in Harper's Weekly











Theodore R. Davis's illustration of President Johnson's impeachment trial in the Senate in 1868 as published in Harper's Weekly


There is a cancer growing on U.S. democracy and despite what GOP lawmakers might say publicly, plenty of them are spooked about it as more and more evidence piles up. For the good of the nation, a president facing such a storm should leave office until he is acquitted or convicted. Ideally, he would put the country above his own immediate advantage and leave voluntarily. If so, that’s well and good—we have a tried and true line of succession and it’s been used in the past more than once.
But this is Donald Trump. He will deny and defy any congressional findings or FBI conclusions, marshal his followers in support, pardon himself and any family members who are implicated, fire investigators, and precipitate a full-on constitutional crisis. It will be a crisis that can only be resolved by forcibly removing him. And that will not go over well with his more ardent followers:

A new Public Policy Polling survey shows, as if we needed any more evidence of this, that Trump voters live in an alternate reality that completely ignores the facts. This is especially true on the Russia matter, where more than 3/4ths of them don’t believe what Donald Trump, Jr. has publicly admitted to.
 

There are only two ways to stop this clown before a hypothetical sweep in 2018, and by then the damage to our democracy could be irreversible. That means that, at least for now, only Republicans can end this madness and restore order.

Welcome back, Saturday Campaign D.I.Y.ers! For those who tune in, welcome to the Nuts & Bolts of a Democratic campaign. Each week we discuss issues that help drive successful campaigns. If you’ve missed prior diaries, please visit our group or follow Nuts & Bolts Guide.
This year we’ve been focused on activism, and how our activists outside of traditional campaigns wage their own campaign to help oust politicians opposed to them on the issues. Every step we make culminates in one action: getting candidates elected.
One of the steps many activists eventually look at is forming a PAC, a state or federal entity designed to help raise and spend money to assist candidates. When organizations start to grow they look at a way to take their energy and put it toward funding efforts, and building a state or federal PAC allows your activism to fund their efforts during a campaign season.

Neil Armstrong descends the step ladder affixed to the side of the Eagle to take our first step on the Sea of Tranquility, July 20, 1969











Neil Armstrong descends the step ladder affixed to the side of the Eagle to take our first step on the Sea of Tranquility, July 20, 1969


It was 48 years ago this week when my two siblings and I gathered around the old style TV set, one of us still in diapers. That set only got three channels—that’s all there were at the time. But on that balmy summer night in Lexington, Kentucky, all three channels showed the same thing, and in homes all across the land, kids were staying up way past their bedtime to witness it:

Gathered around the television with his family, he watched in suspense as announcers kept emphasizing that they didn't know whether the lunar module, called "Eagle," was going to be able to land. Astronauts might have had to abort the landing if conditions got too risky.
After astronaut Neil Armstrong uttered the now-famous phrase, "the Eagle has landed," Robinson still didn't relax. He waited impatiently for the first moon walk, which didn't happen for another six hours. It was late by then, but he wasn't tired. He stayed up to watch the entire broadcast.
Shortly before 11 p.m. Eastern time, Armstrong climbed down the ladder and declared: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

In the midst of wars, civil unrest at home and aboard, and economic upheaval, the world briefly forgot its many troubles and watched, riveted, as an ancient dream, as old as humanity, played out right before our eyes. If only we had such an inspirational scene to look forward to today, as it now appears more chaos and civil unrest lies dead ahead.

This week in the war on workers: CEOs being paid 271 times the average worker

The Economic Policy Institute is out with its annual look at CEO pay, and by two measures, the pay of CEOs at the nation’s 350 largest companies is nauseating: 271 times what the typical worker made. Though that ratio is down from its peak, consider that in 1989, the ratio was 59 to one. That means we’re talking about a shift that happened during the lives of Millennials. 


Using the stock-options-realized measure, the average CEO compensation for CEOs in the 350 largest U.S. firms was $15.6 million in 2016. Compensation in 2016 (data available through May) is down 4.3 percent (from $16.3 million) since 2015 but up 45.6 percent (from $10.7 million) since the recovery began in 2009. The fall in average compensation reflected a loss for the highest-paid CEOs while those in the bottom 80 percent earned more in 2016 than in 2015.
Using the stock-options-granted measure, the average CEO compensation for CEOs in the 350 largest U.S. firms was $13.0 million in 2016, up 3.8 percent from $12.5 million in 2015.
From 1978 to 2016, inflation-adjusted compensation, based on realized stock options, of the top CEOs increased 937 percent, a rise more than 70 percent greater than stock market growth and substantially greater than the painfully slow 11.2 percent growth in a typical worker’s annual compensation over the same period. CEO compensation, when measured using the value of stock options granted, grew more slowly from 1978 to 2016, rising 807 percent—a still-substantial increase relative to every benchmark available.
Using the stock-options-realized measure, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 20-to-1 in 1965, peaked at 376-to-1 in 2000, and was 271-to-1 in 2016—down from 286-to-1 in 2015 but still far higher than at any point in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s. Using the stock-options-granted measure, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio rose to 224-to-1 in 2016 (from 220-to-1 in 2015), significantly down from its peak of 411-to-1 in 2000 but still much higher than the 54-to-1 ratio of 1989 or the 18-to-1 ratio of 1965.

Fighting climate change by paying people not to cut down trees. See Mark Sumner's post below.


This is the 513th edition of the Spotlight on Green News & Views (previously known as the Green Diary Rescue) usually appears twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Here is the July 19 Green Spotlight. More than 27,435 environmentally oriented stories have been rescued to appear in this series since 2006. Inclusion of a story in the Spotlight does not necessarily indicate my agreement with or endorsement of it.
(The usual categories have been left out of this Spotlight because of the relatively small number of diaries that are included, not permanently from the series.)

Moving them out.

Besame writes—Daily Bucket: Rescue mission provides sanctuary for threatened herbarium specimens: “The threatened with destruction 470,000 herbarium specimens at the University of Louisiana at Monroe were rescued by the Botanical Research Institute of Texas this Tuesday. Half of the herbarium cabinets were loaded into freezer trucks (for pest prevention) and hit the road. They are moving from Monroe, Louisiana to Fort Worth Texas. The other half will be fetched in two weeks. BRIT recognizes the hard work of the many curators, as well as those people who worked closely with and supported the collections. BRIT vows to honor their contributions by making sure this priceless scientific collection continues to be accessible to the world. This herbarium will live on (and retain its name as the R.

Mother Mags writes—The GOP wants to make sure the Mexican gray wolf is a real species. Wonder why? “If you’re not a real, genuine species, but merely some mutt of a dog, then you shouldn’t qualify for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Or so Republican thinking goes, according to a story in today’s Phoenix New Times: Buried in the dry language of a newly released budget proposal for the U.S. Department of the Interior is a line that you could easily miss: a directive to study the genetics behind the Mexican gray wolf and another species, the red wolf.Driving around the rural Southwest, it’s not uncommon to see billboards denouncing wolves and the wolf recovery project, which began reintroducing Mexican grays in the late ‘90s. Wolves of course are predators, they kill cattle and sheep, which the livestock industry and their political flunkies don’t like. But here’s the deal: Mexican gray wolves are native to this region, cattle and sheep are not. One contributes to a healthy environment, the other destroys it. For a long time we’ve known that removing predators from nature screws things up immeasurably, which is the point of the Endangered Species Act, signed in 1973 by Republican President Richard Nixon. We don’t protect species just because they’re really cute or extremely big and awesome, but because they’re ecologically linked to everything else.”

Republican Wisconsin state Sen. Andre Jacque introduced a bill that, if passed, would put the University of Wisconsin-Madison OB-GYN residency program’s national accreditation at risk. The bill, which was introduced in April as AB 206, would ban faculty from training their resident physicians in abortion care.
The Journal-Sentinel reports:

Jacque’s bill, introduced in April, would prohibit UW-Madison employees from performing abortions as well as training others or receiving training in performing abortions anywhere other than a hospital. Since the training requires participating in abortions and government dollars can’t be used to facilitate abortions, the training can’t take place at the university hospital. That would leave nowhere for UW-Madison residents to obtain it. They would have to join another residency program if they wanted to become a certified OB-GYN.

If passed into law, this would exacerbate the current OB-GYN shortage in the state, according to local medical groups. Calvin Bruce, a retired family doctor, testified on the behalf of the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians:

Our academy is neither pro-choice nor pro-life. We have members who have strongly held beliefs on both sides of that issue. We are strongly pro-patient. And we strongly oppose AB206 on workforce, medical and academic grounds.
You would not dictate to the cardiac surgeons how they should teach bypass surgery. Nor to the neurosurgeons how they should teach brain surgery. Does it make sense to presume you know better than obstetricians how to teach their craft?

Trump's HUD turns a blind eye to housing segregation—and yes, it may benefit Trump's own business

Lynne Patton was one of the many Trump family employees brought in to sell Trump at his Republican Party Convention











Lynne Patton was one of the many Trump family employees brought in to sell Trump at his Republican Party Convention


It turns out that hiring your family’s event planner and/or Vice President of the Eric Trump Foundation for a high-level spot in the government's Housing and Urban Development agency may not lead to competent government decision-making.
Lynne Patton, a former event planner for the Trump family whose nomination to a HUD position drew criticism from policy experts and housing advocates last month, reversed HUD’s position on Westchester’s zoning laws on Tuesday. The agency had rejected 10 previous versions of the county’s “Analysis of Impediments,” a document which HUD grantees must submit to demonstrate their use of taxpayer money will not get spent into systems that tacitly reinforce racial segregation in housing.
Westchester’s fight with HUD originated from a lawsuit brought by the Anti-Discrimination Center. The county struck a settlement with HUD in 2009, but has failed to comply fully with it for close to a decade.

Despite being once again rejected just last April, Westchester County, New York, was able to finally skirt the HUD regulations requiring the county to demonstrate HUD funds would not be used for projects that encourage segregation with a devious plan indeed:

Westchester waited a few weeks once Patton was put in charge of the HUD office with jurisdiction over the county. Then, officials resubmitted the same analysis that was insufficient in April. Patton accepted the same figures her predecessors had rejected.

Patton has never worked in housing policy decision-making in her life, up until Trump put her in charge of these things. Coincidentally, resubmitting the same report that prior experts had rejected as insufficient turned out to be just fine when she thumbed through it.
Conveniently for the Trump family, however, weakening oversight of HUD programs will likely benefit them financially; the Trump Organization is co-owner of the largest federally subsidized housing complex in the nation, in Brooklyn, and relaxation of anti-discrimination regulations for that and similar New York properties will be a boon to landlords who want to continue to pocket federal cash but don’t want to be bothered with federal restrictions on who can get it.

WHAT TIPPED YOU OFF?











WHAT TIPPED YOU OFF?


All is not well in Republicanville. No matter how slavish the Fox News segments become, it ain't working; it is slowly dawning on powerful Republicans that the president they are so dutifully protecting and sucking up to may, in fact, be an idiot.
Trump’s struggles go beyond health care. More than six months into Trump’s presidency, Republicans have no legislative accomplishments other than the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a confusing foreign policy, and a White House that is perpetually in damage-control mode. From lawmakers and governors to donors and foreign policy experts, a certain realization is sinking in within the party, based on more than a dozen interviews in recent days: Donald Trump has been a historically weak and ineffective president.
That it took six months to start wondering whether the man who talked about grabbing women, who discussed his penis size during a presidential debate, who sent his press secretary to baldly lie about the size of the crowds on his inauguration day, and who is currently engaged in a public defense of his campaign team openly seeking the assistance of the Russian government during a period of unprecedented assault on our election systems by that government, is perhaps not the brilliant world-shaping genius he made himself out to be.
This is the problem with the Republican Party. They don't catch on too quick.
Even the president’s top backers are losing patience. Billionaire Trump patrons Rebekah and Bob Mercer are “apoplectic” over the health care debacle, with renewed fears that Trump’s lofty goals of changing Washington have become all but impossible, said a Trump administration adviser. The adviser added that lobbyists and establishment lawmakers are making Trump’s life more difficult. [...]
“They’re saying, ‘It can’t be done, he can’t change Washington,’” the adviser said, before putting more of the blame for the lack of progress on Senate Majority Leader McConnell. “It’s the Washington cartel at its worst revolting against the president.”

This drilling rig is in the Gulf of Mexico. Nothing ever happened there that should worry North Carolinians, right?











This drilling rig is in the Gulf of Mexico. Nothing ever happened there that should worry North Carolinians, right?







This week at progressive state blogs is designed specifically to focus attention on the writing and analysis of people focused on their home turf. Here is the July 15 edition. Inclusion of a blog post does not necessarily indicate my agreement with—or endorsement of—its contents.






Cathy Myers on her Harley.

Amy Lyn Smith at Electablog of Michigan writes—‘Single-payer healthcare is achievable’ says Cathy Myers, who wants Paul Ryan’s Congressional seat: 

Cathy Myers literally lives across the street from Rep. Paul Ryan in Janesville, Wisconsin, so she knows exactly who she’s up against. Not to mention having witnessed his many attempts to wrest healthcare coverage away from millions of Americans just to give the wealthy a tax break.
Healthcare is one of the primary reasons Myers decided to run for Ryan’s seat in Congress, which is up for grabs in 2018. She believes healthcare is a right — and that the healthcare plans supported by Ryan aren’t actually healthcare plans, she says.

Why suggest a healthcare plan that isn’t one? The healthcare plan Paul Ryan proposed is actually a tax break for the very top, and the number of people that were going to be cut out of healthcare was staggering.
The whole point of healthcare is to figure out how to cover people, not how to exclude people.





With every new Republican proposal threatening to deprive millions more Americans of healthcare coverage, now may be the best possible time for Democrats to begin lobbying hard for what would actually help the most Americans: single-payer healthcare.
According to Physicians for a National Health Program, single-payer health insurance, also known as “Medicare for all,” means a single public or quasi-public agency organizes healthcare financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands. Under a single-payer system, all residents of the U.S. would be covered for medically necessary services, including doctor, hospital, preventive, long-term care, mental health, reproductive health, dental, vision, prescription drug and medical supply costs.
