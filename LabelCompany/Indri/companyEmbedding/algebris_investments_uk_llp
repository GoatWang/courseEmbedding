Algebris Investments LLP is a London-based asset management company which specialises in the global finance sector.[1] Sam Jones of the Financial Times named it as "one of London's best-known hedge funds".[2] In December 2010 it managed $1.4 billion in funds.[3]
The Algebris CoCo Fund, which manages $900m, is up 45 per cent for 2012, according to an investor – more than 10 times the average hedge fund – thanks to its investments in so-called cocos, or contingent convertibles – instruments designed to help banks stabilise their balance sheets.[2]
Algebris was founded by Davide Serra (from Genoa), a former analyst with Morgan Stanley, and Frenchman Eric Halet, a fund manager for Wellington Investments, in early 2006.[1] Seed capital came from The Children's Investment Fund Foundation's Chris Hohn, who holds a 22 per cent stake.[4] It has offices in London and Singapore.[1]
The flagship Algebris Global Financials Fund launched in October 2006. Algebris subsequently launched the Algebris Emerging Markets Financials Fund in January 2010, a UCITS version of the flagship fund in January 2011, the Algebris Financial CoCo Fund in March 2011 and a UCITS version of this strategy, the Algebris Financial Credit Fund in August 2012.
Key partners include Massimo Massimilla, at Algebris since inception, responsible for investments and clients in Europe, Latin America and Turkey.
