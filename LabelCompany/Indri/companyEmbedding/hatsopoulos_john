Hollywood has nothing on Greater Boston’s technology world when it comes to an obsession with youth. From Kendall Square to the Innovation District, companies trip over each other every day to recruit new, fresh-faced tech talent that can help them go public.In that culture, John and George Hatsopoulos stick out like a couple of sore thumbs. John, the chief executive of Tecogen Inc., is 79 years old, which makes him George’s kid brother. This chief executive is playing tennis — not extreme sports — during his spare time.

But the brothers, who together own slightly more than half of Tecogen, are chasing the same dream that drives countless Cambridge twentysomethings to work deep into the night — building a company around developing technology and taking it public.Talk to John for five minutes and he’ll convince you of two things: Age and enthusiasm are not issues at Tecogen.

“I’m 79 years old and I work more than 60 hours a week,” John said a couple of days ago. “This is the best time I’ve ever had in my life.”
John and George, a Tecogen director at 86, have more than a confident attitude. The Hatsopoulos brothers have the kind of track record most up-and-coming technology executives can only dream about. They’ve spent a half century creating businesses out of new technology and taking them public.Their first public company, Thermo Electron Inc. of Waltham, was based on George’s research developing a device for the direct conversion of heat to electricity while attending MIT in the 1950s.

That business was a success in its own right, but it also spun out another 20 public companies that worked on everything from medical equipment to bomb-detecting devices.If John and George don’t sound particularly glitzy, neither does the company they run today. Tecogen doesn’t create flashy apps to control heating and cooling systems. It builds power systems that can generate electricity and run heating or cooling units for big buildings. Their niche: customers looking for especially high efficiency and low emissions.Tecogen traces its roots to an old Thermo Electron unit that served as the company’s general research division in decades past. The company operates in Waltham — just a mile or so from what is today known as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. — the epicenter for a technology boom of another generation.The Hatsopoulos brothers bought the business from Thermo more than a decade ago and brought many of its employees with them.That includes Tecogen’s president, Robert Panora, who ran product development, engineering, and operations functions when the business was owned by Thermo Electron.Today, Tecogen is a growing but modest-sized business. It generates about $15 million in annual sales and employs about 66 people. Like many small technology companies, it is losing money while it increases business.Over the summer, Tecogen filed paperwork to raise $20 million in the stock market and aimed to launch its initial public offering last week.The timing, amid choppy markets and a government shutdown, was not ideal. John Hatsopoulos says offers to buy Tecogen shares were lower than expected so he withdrew the IPO.“We’re not about to give our company away,” he says. “We’d be doing a lot of damage to our existing shareholders and employees who have stock options.”Tecogen’s short-term solution for its cash needs is a direct line to the chief executive’s checkbook.John Hatsopoulos, who is paid $1 a year as chief executive, extended a $1.1 million letter of credit to the company in July, according to Tecogen IPO documents.He said the company would look for other private financing and hopefully try again to go public next year.Skeptics might view Tecogen’s public stock plans as a way out for older owners tired of funding a business from their own pockets.John Hatsopoulos insists Tecogen’s IPO plan was about raising money to expand and capitalize on technology advances the company has made in the last few years. And the chief executive says he doesn’t have plans to go anywhere.“As long as I’m healthy, I have no intention of retiring,” Hatsopoulos says.“Maybe nature will change my mind, but I have a goal of being around for 10 or 20 more active years.”The Hatsopoulos brothers have always had big ambitions. Maybe that’s what keeps them young.Steven Syre is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at syre@globe.com.

Early life[edit]
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927[1] and is related to[how?] the former rector of the Athens Polytechnic School, Nicolas Kitsikis. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]
Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics[edit]
In 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:



“
When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.
”



The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.
In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]
Overview[edit]
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..
In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

Early life[edit]
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927[1] and is related to[how?] the former rector of the Athens Polytechnic School, Nicolas Kitsikis. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).[2]
Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics[edit]
In 1965, he and Joseph Keenan published their textbook Principles of General Thermodynamics, which restates the second law of thermodynamics in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.[3] Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:



“
When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.
”



The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,[4] and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of entropy to the non-equilibrium domain.
In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.[5]
Overview[edit]
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of Matrad Corporation (New York).[2] Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, The Thermo-Electron Engine.[6] Matrad corporation was owned by the family of Peter M. Nomikos, a Harvard Business School graduate. In 1956, Nomikos co-founded with Hatsopoulos the Thermo Electron Corporation.[7] Thermo Electron became a major provider of analytical instruments and services for a variety of domains under the development of George Hatsopoulos, John Hatsopoulos, and Arvin Smith.[8] In 1965, George Hatsopoulos was president of the Thermo Electron Engineering Corporation and Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering at M.I.T..
In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the John Fritz Medal, which is the highest American award in the engineering profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment.[9] Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 2011, along with Arvin Smith and John Hatsopoulos, he was awarded the 2011 Pittcon Heritage Award from the Chemical Heritage Foundation.

Immigrant Entrepreneur Hall of Fame: Dr. George N. Hatsopoulos


 	
Country of origin: Greece
Year came to U.S.: mid-1940’s
Education: BS, MS, PhD Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Business: Thermo Fischer Scientific (1956)
Headquarters: Waltham, MA
2015 revenue: $17 billion
Worldwide employment: 52,400
Ranked 164 in 2016 Fortune 500
 

Thermo Electron Corporation was started in 1956 with $50,000. It became Thermo Fischer Scientific and had revenues of $17 billion in 2015.
The company’s first product, the thermionic energy converter, never made it to market.

 
George N. Hatsopoulos grew up in Nazi-occupied Greece. He admired Thomas Edison and wanted to emulate him as both an inventor and entrepreneur. As a teenager, he built and sold radios and transmitters, which were outlawed by the Nazis.
After the war, he came to the United States with a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at MIT. In 1956, Hatsopoulos finished his doctoral dissertation about his theoretical invention of an engine that converted heat directly into electricity without any moving parts called the “thermionic energy converter.” That same year, he and his brother John formed the Thermo Electron Corporation to commercialize his invention. They started the company in George’s living room and basement with $50,000 borrowed from a Greek ship owner.
The energy converter never came to fruition but the effort spawned a successful engineering company, which went on to become the largest analytical instrumentation company in the world. The innovative company has been referred to as a “perpetual idea machine.” From the beginning, Hatsopoulos saw the value in turning ideas into products and new businesses. His strategy was to make each promising technology the core of its own new subsidiary to encourage entrepreneurial activity.
Hatsopoulos retired as chairman of Thermo Electron in 2000 and remained an active board member. Thermo Electron Corporation acquired Fisher Scientific in 2006 and became Thermo Fisher Scientific.  The company now serves pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research Institutions, government agencies, and environmental and process control industries with a mission to “enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.”
Hatsopoulos kept academic ties as well as industrial. He served as a faculty member from 1956 to 1962 and senior lecturer until 1990 at MIT. His community service includes the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Securities and Exchange Commission Advisory Committee on Capital Formation and Regulatory Process, the Advisory Committee of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the boards of many other corporations and institutions.

George Hatsopoulos
Dr. George N. Hatsopoulos receives the Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment for his development of the thermionic converter and his innovative methods of creating new technology-based enterprises.

As a teen-ager in Nazi-occupied Greece, Dr. Hatsopoulos built and sold illegal radios and transmitters. Later, as a young man, he won a scholarship to MIT to study mechanical engineering with the goal of becoming both an inventor and a businessman. Forty years later, in an age focused on core competencies, his company, Thermo Electron Corporation, is a pacesetter eager to experiment with new technologies and build new subsidiaries around them. Dr. Hatsopoulos transformed a once small laboratory into a world leader in environmental monitoring, biomedical manufacturing and many other specialized products and technologies. The company employs over 17,000 people and has annual sales of $3 billion.

"You can't be enamored with technology," Dr. Hatsopoulos has said. "You must instead be driven by the needs of the marketplace." That pragmatic philosophy has been a useful guide to the founder and now Chief Executive Officer of the Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Electron Corporation.

Dr. Hatsopoulos' success began when he devised a theoretical engine that converted heat directly into electricity without using any moving parts. His thermionic converter, the first in an impressive string of technological innovations, became the catalyst for the creation of a company that is today an international leader in manufacturing. Based on an ever-increasing number of ideas and technologies coming from Thermo Electron, the company is often referred to as a "perpetual idea machine." Dr. Hatsopoulos sees those ideas not just as new products, but also as seeds for new businesses. He developed a strategy to make each new technology the core of its own new subsidiary, armed with the flexibility and resources to explore further innovation.

Thermo Electron is now parent to 18 of these "spin-out" companies, all designed to motivate entrepreneurship. Thermo Electron is careful to explain that it spins out, not spins off, its companies. The company always retains a majority stake in each new endeavor and offers its new stock to the public and not to existing shareholders. The corporate parent then continues to provide strategic planning, employee benefits and pension fund management, executive recruiting and other internal administration services, thus freeing up the subsidiary to focus on innovation and market needs.

Dr. Hatsopoulos' formula for success is really very simple. He seeks to anticipate society's problems, develop the technology to solve them, and have the product on line in time to meet the need. But it is in his implementation of that formula that he stands apart as a business leader. In creating a new corporate structure, he has discovered a way to sustain growth in today's rapidly changing world markets.
Note: This profile is excerpted from the commemorative brochure published at the time of the awards' presentation.

UPDATES SINCE RECEIVING THE HEINZ AWARD
May 2006 - Thermo Electron Corporation acquired Fisher Scientific and became Thermo Fisher Scientific, making it one of the most important life science corporations in Massachusetts, employing 30,000 and having a stock market value of $15.5 billion. - The Boston Globe
October 2005 - George Hatsopoulos is still "thinking big" at 78 as he builds another company, Pharos, into a billion-dollar success. Pharos has two divisions - one that develops blood pumps and the other that develops semiconductors. - The Boston Globe
September 2000 - Hatsopoulos announces that he is retiring from his position as director of the Photoelectron Corporation, the group he has led since its founding in 1989.
March 2000 - Hatsopoulos is inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs. He and the other 73 inductees for 2000 were chosen "for their willingness to take risks and to invest capital and energy into ventures that made positive contributions to society." - AScribe Newswire
December 1999 - Hatsopoulos announces that he will retire as chairman of Thermo Electron Corporation as of January 1. Thermo Electron is the company that Hatsopoulos launched in 1956, and while he will step down as CEO, he plans to "continue as a corporate director and remain active" in the company. - The Boston Globe
