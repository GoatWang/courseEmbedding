Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]
Schools and subsidiaries[edit]
University of Phoenix[edit]
Main article: University of Phoenix

Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

According to USA Today, the University of Phoenix's Detroit campus has a graduation rate of 10%, but a student loan default rate of 26.4%.[20]

Carnegie Learning is a publisher of math curricula for middle school, high school, and post-secondary students. The company uses a blended approach, with a textbook and software (called Cognitive Tutor) for each subject. The company also produces products for the homeschool and tutoring markets. Based in Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Learning was founded by cognitive science researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in conjunction with veteran mathematics teachers.
All of the Cognitive Tutor curricula are based on extensive scientific research from Carnegie Mellon University, along with field tests in schools throughout the United States. The Cognitive Tutors are based on the ACT-R theory of learning, memory and performance. The Tutors themselves were developed using an empirical testing process.[31]

Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

Carnegie Learning is a publisher of math curricula for middle school, high school, and post-secondary students. The company uses a blended approach, with a textbook and software (called Cognitive Tutor) for each subject. The company also produces products for the homeschool and tutoring markets. Based in Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Learning was founded by cognitive science researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in conjunction with veteran mathematics teachers.
All of the Cognitive Tutor curricula are based on extensive scientific research from Carnegie Mellon University, along with field tests in schools throughout the United States. The Cognitive Tutors are based on the ACT-R theory of learning, memory and performance. The Tutors themselves were developed using an empirical testing process.[31]
Apollo Group announced in August 2011 a $75 million deal to buy Carnegie Learning along with a separate agreement to acquire related technology from CMU for $21.5 million, to be paid over 10 years.[32]

Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

Carnegie Learning is a publisher of math curricula for middle school, high school, and post-secondary students. The company uses a blended approach, with a textbook and software (called Cognitive Tutor) for each subject. The company also produces products for the homeschool and tutoring markets. Based in Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Learning was founded by cognitive science researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in conjunction with veteran mathematics teachers.
All of the Cognitive Tutor curricula are based on extensive scientific research from Carnegie Mellon University, along with field tests in schools throughout the United States. The Cognitive Tutors are based on the ACT-R theory of learning, memory and performance. The Tutors themselves were developed using an empirical testing process.[31]
Apollo Group announced in August 2011 a $75 million deal to buy Carnegie Learning along with a separate agreement to acquire related technology from CMU for $21.5 million, to be paid over 10 years.[32]
Insight Schools[edit]
Insight Schools is an online high school offering classes from 9th to 12th grade. Insight both ran high schools for school districts and operated online schools in several U.S. states.[33] Apollo Group acquired Insight Schools in 2007; in 2011 Apollo Group sold Insight Schools to Kaplan, Inc. [34]
Aptimus Marketing[edit]
Aptimus is a full-service, in-house marketing agency for Apollo Group education institutions, including the University of Phoenix, Axia College, the Institute for Professional Development, Olympus High School, and Insight School.[35]

On June 11, 2015, Apollo Education Group acquired a 62% interest in TIY Academy, LLC ("The Iron Yard"), a provider of nondegree information technology bootcamp programs in the United States, for $15.9 million.[37] The Iron Yard subsidiary ceased operations and closed all campuses in 2017.[38]
Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

 Our Mission 

Apollo Education Group™, Inc. was founded in 1973 in response to a gradual shift in higher education demographics from a student population dominated by youth to one in which approximately half the students are adults and over 80 percent of whom work full-time. Apollo's founder, Dr. John Sperling, believed—and events proved him right—that lifelong employment with a single employer would be replaced by lifelong learning and employment with a variety of employers. Lifelong learning requires an institution dedicated solely to the education of working adults.
Today, Apollo Education Group™, Inc., through its subsidiaries, University of Phoenix, Apollo Global, College for Financial Planning, The Iron Yard and Western International University has established itself as a leading provider of higher education programs for working adults by focusing on servicing the needs of the working adult.


 Services We Offer 

Apollo Education Group™ provides educational services, educational support services, consulting services and technical support services to institutions offering post-secondary education, including:

Lead generation and recruiting of students for enrollment at educational institutions.
Development of marketing collateral, including web content and other promotional materials.
Assistance with administration of financial aid programs.
Curricula development and related consulting services.
Training of faculty in the field of on-line teaching.
Technical support and troubleshooting services related to computer hardware and software for computer-aided learning.
Student support services such as educational counseling for students.

Additionally, Apollo Education Group, Inc. is the owner of BPP Holdings in the United Kingdom. It formed a joint venture with Carlyle Group, called Apollo Global, to make international acquisitions.[3] Apollo also purchased UNIACC college in Santiago, Chile, and ULA college in Mexico.[4]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]
Schools and subsidiaries[edit]
University of Phoenix[edit]
Main article: University of Phoenix
The University of Phoenix is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Apollo Education Group. The University of Phoenix is one of the largest higher education providers in North America.[16] The university has more than 200 campuses worldwide and confers degrees in over 100 degree programs at the associate, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels.[17] The University of Phoenix has an open enrollment admission policy only requiring a high-school diploma, GED, or an equivalent qualification.[18] The school also provides associate or bachelor's degree applicants opportunity for advanced placement through its prior learning assessment, through which, aside from previous coursework, college credit can come from experiential learning essays, corporate training, and certificates or licenses.[19]
According to USA Today, the University of Phoenix's Detroit campus has a graduation rate of 10%, but a student loan default rate of 26.4%.[20]
Western International University[edit]
Western International University (West) is a university offering online programs for adult learners. Founded in 1978, West offers associate, bachelor and master degree programs to approximately 1,374 students (Fall 2014). West's mission is to provide a broad educational foundation, with a focus on business and technology, designed to prepare students for leadership positions in a dynamic, global marketplace. West is located in Tempe, Arizona and offers online education through its virtual campus.
Apollo Global[edit]
Apollo Group has formed Apollo Global to manage and form subsidiaries, assets, and holdings overseas. As part of their first acquisitions, Apollo Global acquired University for the Arts, Sciences, and Communication (UNIACC) in Chile as well as the now defunct Meritus University in Canada.[3][21]
Apollo Global is a joint venture between the Apollo Group and the Carlyle Group. The two partners invested $1 billion in Apollo Global. The Apollo Group invested roughly $801 million and owns 80.1% of the new company. Carlyle invested $199 million and controls the remaining shares. Apollo Global replaced Apollo International.[22][23]
BPP Holdings[edit]
Main articles: BPP Holdings and BPP University
BPP Holdings is a holding company of the United Kingdom-based provider of professional and academic education. The Company is divided into BPP Learning Media, BPP Professional Education and BPP University.

Carnegie Learning is a publisher of math curricula for middle school, high school, and post-secondary students. The company uses a blended approach, with a textbook and software (called Cognitive Tutor) for each subject. The company also produces products for the homeschool and tutoring markets. Based in Pittsburgh, PA, Carnegie Learning was founded by cognitive science researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in conjunction with veteran mathematics teachers.
All of the Cognitive Tutor curricula are based on extensive scientific research from Carnegie Mellon University, along with field tests in schools throughout the United States. The Cognitive Tutors are based on the ACT-R theory of learning, memory and performance. The Tutors themselves were developed using an empirical testing process.[31]
Apollo Group announced in August 2011 a $75 million deal to buy Carnegie Learning along with a separate agreement to acquire related technology from CMU for $21.5 million, to be paid over 10 years.[32]
Insight Schools[edit]
Insight Schools is an online high school offering classes from 9th to 12th grade. Insight both ran high schools for school districts and operated online schools in several U.S. states.[33] Apollo Group acquired Insight Schools in 2007; in 2011 Apollo Group sold Insight Schools to Kaplan, Inc. [34]

Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

Lawsuits and financial reporting[edit]
See also: University of Phoenix § Lawsuits and investigations
After a separate investigation in 2004, the Apollo Group paid about $10 million in fines to the U.S. Department of Education, which had criticised UoP's admissions practices: for example, recruiters were paid bonuses depending on the numbers they signed up.[39] "In 2004, a scathing report issued by the US Department of Education concluded that Phoenix, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, had a 'high-pressure sales culture' that intimidated recruiters who failed to meet targets and encouraged the enrollment of unqualified students—in short that it rewarded 'the recruiters who put the most "asses in classes"'. Apollo illegally withheld the report, but it was leaked and the group's value on the stock market crashed. A suit was brought alleging that its management had 'disseminated materially false and misleading financial statements in an effort to inflate its stock price and attract investors'."[40]
"In 2006, the company's controller and chief accounting officer resigned amid allegations that the books had been cooked; in 2007, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council threatened to withdraw Apollo's listing from the stock exchange."[40]
In January 2008, the above stock-price suit was decided. Apollo was found liable for misleading investors by failing to disclose the Department of Education report that criticized the University of Phoenix's recruiting practices. The jury awarded the shareholders $280 million in damages.[41][40] The trial judge vacated the verdict and found for the defendants,[42] but the Ninth Circuit reinstated the verdict.[43][44][45] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Apollo's appeal of the verdict.[46][47][40] The case ultimately resolved with Apollo being liable for $145 million; the reported $280 million figure may have been an error because the jury's award was for $5.55 per share.[48][49]
In November 2008, Apollo paid $1.89 million to settle a religious discrimination class action without admitting wrongdoing. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had brought the claim on behalf of non-Mormon employees of University of Phoenix Online. Under the settlement, University of Phoenix Online agreed to prohibit favoritism toward the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[50]
In July 2015, Apollo announced the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was investigating UoP for unfair business practices; "The company must hand over documents regarding matters that include its marketing, tuition, billing, accreditation, and military recruitment practices going back as far as 2011."[51] In January 2016, the FTC filed suit against Apollo and University of Phoenix.[52] The court ordered Apollo and UoP to comply with the FTC's civil investigative demands.[53]

Founding[edit]
Apollo Education Group, Inc. was founded in 1973 by John Sperling.[6]
Financial performance[edit]
Corporate revenues for the year ending August 31, 2005 were $2.251 billion.[7]
As of 5 October 2011, Apollo Group had a market capitalization of $5.36 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.22.[8]
The Apollo Group announced quarterly results on 30 June 2011. The company reported $1.45 in earnings per share for the previous quarter, exceeding the Thomson Reuters estimate of $1.33 by $0.12. Apollo Group's quarterly revenue was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.[9]
In March 2011 the Apollo Group sold its corporate headquarters in Arizona and leased it back in order to raise $170 million in cash. The deal with Cole Real Estate Investments included a 20-year lease requiring Apollo to remain in the complex.[10]"In our view, it does not change the view of the company. Apollo isn't hungry for cash: It carries little debt but generates $4 billion in revenue and has $650 million in net income and $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet," commented Peter Wahlstrom of Morningstar, an investment-research company.[11]
However, the revenue of the company continued to fall: in the fiscal year ending in August 31, 2011, the net revenue was $4.7 billion; in 2012, $4.2 billion; in 2013, $3.6 billion.[1] The operating income during this period fell from $956 million in 2011, to $676 million in 2012, to $427 million in 2013. the company attributed this to a decline in enrollment, with degreed enrollment declining from 380,000 in 2011, to 328,000 in 2012, to 269,000 in 2013.[12]
On May 6, 2016, the shareholders of the company approved the sale of the firm for $1.14 billion to a group of private investors:[13] Najafi Companies , a Phoenix firm, the New York based Apollo Global Management and, the Vistria Group of Chicago.[14] The offer amounted to $10 per share, compared to its high of $89/share in 2009. The delisting was completed on February 1, 2017.[15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
