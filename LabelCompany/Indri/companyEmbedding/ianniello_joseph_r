Joseph Ianniello


Chief Operating Officer, CBS CorporationJoseph Ianniello serves as Chief Operating Officer for CBS Corporation. In this role, Ianniello works closely with Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves to establish and execute strategy across all of the Corporation’s businesses, including CBS Television Network, The CW (a joint venture between CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment), CBS Television Studios, CBS Global Distribution Group (CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution), CBS Consumer Products, CBS Home Entertainment, CBS Interactive, CBS Films, Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network, Pop (a joint venture between CBS Corporation and Lionsgate), Smithsonian Networks, Simon & Schuster, CBS Television Stations, CBS Radio and CBS EcoMedia.
In addition, Ianniello oversees the monetization of the Company’s content across platforms, including retransmission consent fees and reverse compensation from affiliates, as well as the licensing of CBS content for digital streaming and broadband services.
At the same time, Ianniello manages all financial operations of CBS Corporation, which is comprised of corporate development (including mergers and acquisitions), treasury, risk management, worldwide tax and information technology, among other areas.
Ianniello was also instrumental in the process of separating CBS from Viacom at the end of 2005. Since then, he has been a key part of the management team that has led CBS to be the #1 media stock among its peers for three of the last five years. He recently guided the Company through the conversion of CBS Outdoor into a real-estate investment trust, marking a first for an outdoor advertising business and ultimately leading to the split-off of CBS Outdoor from CBS in 2014.
Before he was named Chief Operating Officer, Ianniello served as CBS’s Chief Financial Officer (2009-2013) and Deputy Chief Financial Officer (2008-2009), where he was responsible for the Company’s financial strategy across all of its operations. Ianniello also served as Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer and Treasurer (2006-2008).
Prior to CBS’s separation from Viacom Inc., Ianniello held a variety of financial positions with the Company, including Senior Vice President and Treasurer (2005) and Vice President of Corporate Development (2000-2005), among others. Before joining CBS, Ianniello spent seven years with KPMG in various capacities.
In 2013 and 2014, Ianniello was ranked the #1 chief financial officer by sell-side analysts in Institutional Investor’s annual All-America Executive Team survey. Ianniello serves on the Board of Directors of New Alternatives for Children, Inc., as well as Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE).
Ianniello earned a Bachelor’s of Business Administration at Pace University, where he serves today on its Board of Trustees, and a Master’s of Business Administration at Columbia University. He is married and has two children.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:16 PM ET 07/18/2017
                                                


The TV production and distribution arm of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said on Tuesday it's acquiring the assets of unscripted TV producer Evolution Media. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Evolution Media's roster of shows include hit reality shows such as "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and "Vanderpump Rules," which air on Comcast Corp.-owned NBCUniversal's Bravo.

Sci-fi drama "Westworld" and satirical sketch show "Saturday Night Live" led Emmy award nominations on Thursday with 22 apiece in a list stuffed with new contenders that reflected a booming era for television.

















                                                    TV's complex women leave 'the girlfriend' in the dust

Forget playing "the girlfriend" or "the mom." Television is proving an embarrassment of riches for women thanks to complex, original characters and female-centric plots that are attracting Oscar-caliber movie stars to the small screen.

















                                                    Broadcast TV Enjoys 'Upfront' Lift, but Long-Term Gains Uncertain

The problems plaguing digital advertising have helped broadcast TV networks achieve a positive outcome for the annual advanced TV ad selling season. The top broadcast TV networks including CBS Corp. (CBS), 21st Century Fox's Fox, Comcast Corp.' s NBC and Walt Disney Co.' s ABC have largely wrapped up their annual "upfront" negotiations, the time of year when advertisers commit to buying the bulk of ad inventory for the coming TV season. Jefferies& Co. estimates that prime-time ad spending...

The new deal, announced Thursday, ends similar longstanding relationships that CBS (CBS) had with Sky PLC's Sky News and that Walt Disney Co.' s ABC News had with the BBC, which had spanned more than two decades. "The opportunity to partner with one of the world's largest news organizations was too compelling not to make...

Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA) and Time Warner Inc's Turner are taking the unusual step of streaming full episodes of new shows online or on apps before they air on TV to attract younger viewers in the face of slipping ratings. Premium channels like CBS Corp's Showtime have done this for years to entice new subscribers, but cable networks have not, fearing they might cannibalize TV ratings.

Pace Board of Trustees elects Joe Ianniello

NEW YORK, May 22 – Joseph R. Ianniello has been elected to the Board of Trustees of Pace University in New York, Pace President Stephen J. Friedman announced.
Ianniello serves as Chief Operating Officer for CBS Corporation. In this role, he oversees all financial operations for CBS. In addition, he works closely with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, and senior management to maximize the monetization of the company’s content, including oversight of negotiations for digital streaming, retransmission consent fees and reverse compensation from affiliates. Previously, he served as Chief Financial Officer where he was responsible for the company's financial strategy across all of its operations including mergers and acquisitions and risk management. Ianniello held other positions at CBS beginning in 2006 including Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer and Treasurer.
Ianniello joins the Board of Pace at a time of great change. Pace is making significant investments in its learning and living facilities in Westchester and New York City and has experienced increased enrollments and many new academic programs. Pace has received national recognition for the high employment rate and earning power of its graduates. This academic year, Pace celebrated the 50th anniversary of its Pleasantville campus.
“The leadership and management skills that Joseph Ianniello has demonstrated in his career at CBS Corporation, combined with his devotion to Pace, make him an outstanding addition to our Board of Trustees,” said University President Stephen J. Friedman.  “I have no doubt that Joe’s contributions will help Pace students – the aspiring heart of America – continue succeeding in a broad range of professions and contribute to the nation’s global competitiveness.”
“I am so pleased to welcome Joe to our Board,” said Pace Board Chairman Mark M. Besca, ’81. “His accomplishments in finance, media and development will help Pace reach new heights in academic excellence and the overall student experience.”
“Pace was a key building block in my career development and I’m humbled to now have the opportunity to play some small role in the future of this great institution,” said Ianniello. “I look forward to working with President Friedman, Mark Besca and the entire Board of Trustees as we continue to create an exciting and successful path for Pace’s students and graduates.” 
Previously Ianniello held several positions at Viacom, including SVP and Treasurer, as well as, VP of Corporate Development where he oversaw identifying and assessing potential mergers and acquisitions for the company.  Ianniello also spent seven years with KPMG in various capacities.
In 2013, Ianniello was ranked the #1 chief financial officer by investors and sell-side analysts in Institutional Investor’s annual All-America Executive Team survey. Ianniello serves on the Board of Directors of New Alternatives for Children, Inc. as well as Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE).
Ianniello earned his bachelor of business administration degree from Pace and a master’s degree in business administration from Columbia University. He is married and has two children.
About Pace University: Since 1906, Pace University has educated thinking professionals by providing high quality education for the professions on a firm base of liberal learning amid the advantages of the New York metropolitan area. A private university, Pace has campuses in New York City and Westchester County, New York, enrolling nearly 13,000 students in bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs in its Lubin School of Business, Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, College of Health Professions, School of Education, School of Law, and Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems. www.pace.edu
