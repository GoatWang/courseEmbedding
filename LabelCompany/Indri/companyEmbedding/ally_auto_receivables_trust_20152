                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2015-SN1
    





March 31, 2015 02:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Ally Auto Receivables 
      Trust 2015-SN1:
    

      --$182,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-2a asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$230,000,000 class A-2b asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74,600,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool consists of strong quality leases 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 759, seasoning of 16 months, 
      and a reasonably diversified residual value (RV) maturity schedule.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) 
      to the class A notes is 18.75%, building to 21.75% until the class A-2 
      notes are repaid at which point it reduces to 19.85%. Available CE is 
      sufficient to support Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed credit and residual loss 
      assumptions of 4.25% and 29.45%, respectively.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on Ally's 
      portfolio have exhibited stable performance in recent years. While some 
      normalization has occurred in 2014, overall performance remains well 
      below elevated levels observed in 2008 and 2009.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates Ally Financial, the parent of Ally, 
      the originator and servicer, 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch believes 
      Ally Financial to be a capable originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior 
      securitizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ally Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-SN1 to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, 
      showing downgrades of only one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly 
      more sensitivity to residual loss volatility, though even under Fitch's 
      severe scenario, the class A notes could be downgraded by four 
      categories.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Feb. 27, 2015. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2015-SN1 - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated Oct. 31, 2014.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Ally Auto Receivables 
      Trust 2015-SN1:
    

      --$182,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-2a asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$230,000,000 class A-2b asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74,600,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool consists of strong quality leases 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 759, seasoning of 16 months, 
      and a reasonably diversified residual value (RV) maturity schedule.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) 
      to the class A notes is 18.75%, building to 21.75% until the class A-2 
      notes are repaid at which point it reduces to 19.85%. Available CE is 
      sufficient to support Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed credit and residual loss 
      assumptions of 4.25% and 29.45%, respectively.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on Ally's 
      portfolio have exhibited stable performance in recent years. While some 
      normalization has occurred in 2014, overall performance remains well 
      below elevated levels observed in 2008 and 2009.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates Ally Financial, the parent of Ally, 
      the originator and servicer, 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch believes 
      Ally Financial to be a capable originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior 
      securitizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ally Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-SN1 to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, 
      showing downgrades of only one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly 
      more sensitivity to residual loss volatility, though even under Fitch's 
      severe scenario, the class A notes could be downgraded by four 
      categories.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Feb. 27, 2015. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2015-SN1 - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated Oct. 31, 2014.
