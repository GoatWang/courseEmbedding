Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP is an energy company based in Houston, Texas. It is a master limited partnership operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) industry, primarily providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk owns approximately 14,365 miles (23,118 km) of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having aggregate capacity of approximately 205 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and 24.0 million barrels (MMbbls) of NGLs. Boardwalk's pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas and extends north and east to the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and Boardwalk's NGLs pipeline and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk's common units are traded under the symbol "BWP" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The general partner for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners is Boardwalk GP, LP, which is indirectly owned by Loews Corporation for 100 percent. The common units, class B and general partner interest indirectly owned by Loews Corporation represent approximately 53 percent of the equity interests, excluding the incentive distribution rights.
Operations[edit]
Boardwalk serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk provides a significant portion of pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which customers pay monthly capacity reservation charges (which are charges owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization). Other charges are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges under firm contracts, approximately 12% of revenues were derived from charges based on actual utilization under firm contracts and approximately 7% of revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.
Boardwalk has the following operating subsidiaries:

Texas Gas Transmission, LLC
Gulf South Pipeline Pipeline Company, LP
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC
Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC
Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC
Boardwalk Field Services, LLC

History[edit]
Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merges into Gulf South in 2015. In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana. In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline ethylene pipeline system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers. Boardwalk Field Services, LLC develops and operates gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, and processing infrastructure, and in June 2013 placed its processing plant into service.
Governance[edit]
The current members of the board of directors for Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP are William R. Cordes, Stanley C. Horton, Thomas E. Hyland, Arthur L. Rebell, Peter W. Keegan, Mark L. Shapiro, Kenneth I. Siegel and Andrew H. Tish.

OVERVIEW
 

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (NYSE: BWP) is a midstream master
limited partnership that primarily provides transportation and storage of natural gas and liquids for our customers. Through our
subsidiaries, we own and operate approximately 13,930 miles of interconnected
natural gas pipelines, directly serving customers in thirteen states and
indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern
United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. We
also own and operate more than 435 miles of liquids pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. 
 
In 2016, our pipeline systems transported
approximately 2.3 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas and approximately 64.8 million barrels (MMBbls) of liquids. Average daily throughput on our natural gas pipeline
system during 2016 was approximately 6.3 Bcf. Our natural gas storage
facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in four
states with an aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205 Bcf, and our liquids storage facilities consist of nine salt-dome caverns located in Louisiana
with an aggregate storage capacity of 24 MMBbls. We also own three salt-dome
caverns and a brine pond for use in providing brine supply services and to
support the liquids storage operations.  
 
We serve a broad mix of customers, including producers, local
distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, direct
industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. 
 

    


 The following is a summary of each of our principal operating
subsidiaries:
















  
Texas Gas Transmission, LLC originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. Texas Gas directly serves LDCs, municipalities and power genrators in its market area, which encompasses eight states in the South and Midwest and includes the Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana, metropolitan areas. Texas Gas also has indirect market access to, and receives supply from, the Northeast through interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. A large portion of the gas delivered by the Texas Gas system is used for heating during the winter months.
  
Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields, of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas. Texas Gas uses this gas to meet the operational requirements of its transportation and storage customers and the requirements of its No-Notice Service (NNS) customers. Texas Gas also uses its storage capacity to offer firm and interruptible storage services.   




 



Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP is located along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South directly serves LDCs and municipalities located across the system, including New Orleans, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida; and end-users located across the system, including the Baton Rouge to New Orleans industrial corridor and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Gulf South also has indirect access to off-system markets throughout the Northeast and Southeast through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities.
 
Gulf South has ten natural
gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located
in Bistineau, Louisiana and Jackson, Mississippi, have approximately 83.5
Bcf of working gas storage capacity that  Gulf South uses to offer firm and interruptible
storage service, including NNS, and to support pipeline operations.  Gulf
South also owns and operates eight high-deliverability salt-dome natural gas
storage caverns in Forrest County, Mississippi, having approximately 46.0 Bcf of
total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas
capacity and owns undeveloped land that is suitable for up to five additional
storage caverns.
 




Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC originates near Sherman, Texas and proceeds to the Perryville, Louisiana area. Gulf Crossing indirectly serves markets in the Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, including Florida, through interconnections with Gulf South, Texas Gas and unaffiliated pipelines. 
 






Boardwalk Field Services, LLC operates natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure primarily in South Texas.    


  

Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC provides transportation and storage services for natural gas, natural gas liquids and ethylene and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals, through two hubs in southern Louisiana - the Choctaw Hub in the Mississippi River Corridor area and the Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles area. These assets provide approximately 71.4 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6 Bcf of working gas natural gas storage capacity; significant brine supply infrastructure; and approximately 270 miles of pipeline assets, including an extensive ethylene distribution system. Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream also owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline (Evangeline), an approximately 180-mile interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Port Neches, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where it interconnects with our ethylene distribution system and storage facilities at the Choctaw Hub. Throughput for Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream was 64.8 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2016.

How long do these wells last?Well longevity takes many factors into consideration. Where you are drilling and how deep, along with what formation you are extracting out of and what type of stimulation you are applying, are all important important factors to weigh. Well lifespans can range anywhere from a few months to over 30 years.
Is now a smart time to invest in oil and gas?Pricing in well development has dropped significantly over the past few years.  The costs are now much lower to drill, or to complete or re-complete a well than they were when oil was $100 a barrel. This means the investor has an opportunity to pick up extremely valuable assets at a much-reduced cost right now. Even at a lower commodity price, the potential returns still outperform the majority of investments that are out there while leaving considerably more room for appreciation.
What is the minimum investment?Minimum investments will fluctuate from project to project, and also depend on where and with whom you are operating. First and foremost, you must be accredited. That means you had individual income of $200,000 or more for the last two years, or if you’re married, you and your spouse earned at least $300,000 of combined income, or that you have liquid net worth of $1,000,000 or more, not including the equity in your primary residence.  Our strategy is to keep costs low, to operate in oil-saturated areas and to give the investor the most ownership for their dollar. If you meet the above requirements, we would happy to share the Boardwalk strategy with you to see if our current operation is a healthy fit for your portfolio.
What are the risks of oil and gas investing?All investments contain some level of risk.  But oil and gas has made huge strides in the last decade. Various drilling approaches, advanced stimulations which unlock formidably trapped rock, and cutting-edge geological selection of oil-saturated areas has changed the industry. Rather than being a hit-or-miss approach, the questions are usually more a matter of how much each well will produce. With the worldwide demand for this commodity growing every day and diminishing reserves, oil and gas deserves a seat in your portfolio.
How will I apply these tax deductions?Boardwalk Energy will provide the proper documentation for you to apply your deductions for the calendar year. We will also provide a thorough tax guide that will walk you or your accountant through applying the deductions. Not all CPA’s are experienced with oil and gas and may have some questions. In such an event, we will connect your CPA with an oil and gas tax professional to ensure your deductions are applied properly.
What do I receive for my investment? How secure is it?We will assign your interest in the county that the prospect is located. You will receive those assignments via hard copy and electronically, and your revenue will come directly from the operator. This process ensures your revenue continues throughout the well lifespan.
How do I go about getting more information?It’s very simple.  You can fill out our contact form below and a representative will reach out to you. Or feel free to reach us at the office. Our hours of operation are 9am to 6pm CST. There are many other investments out there for you to consider, but we truly appreciate you taking an interest in reviewing ours.

      dehydration and will interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in 
      Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. The system will be built out over 
      several years and is expected to have a delivery capacity of 275,000 
      Dth/day when fully constructed.

      Energy Production Company on this project," said Stan Horton, President

PR-May 20th, 2011 — UGE International
























































































































































Urban Green Energy (UGE) announce its newest product, The Boardwalk Urban Green Energy (UGE), the leading manufacturer of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) and hybrid renewable energy solutions, announced today its newest product, The Boardwalk, a hybrid wind and solar streetlamp.The Boardwalk is the second addition to UGE’s line of hybrid wind and solar outdoor lighting, after the successful launch of its Sanya hybrid solar streetlamp in December. The Boardwalk gives customers an elegant and completely off-grid lighting solution that is perfect for parks, pathways, and quaint passageways.As Urban Green Energy's sustainable solution to elegant outdoor lighting, the newly introduced Boardwalk operates completely on wind and solar energy, just like its predecessor Sanya. Equipped with a 60 watt LED light that is powered by a 600 watt eddy VAWT and a 150 watt solar panel, The Boardwalk’s distinguishing feature is its old-fashioned and traditional design, reminiscent of the gas streetlights prevalent at the turn of the last century.haracteristic of the entire Urban Green Energy line, The Boardwalk maintains the same key features that define the UGE brand. The original eddy, includes a low start-up speed, whisper-quiet operation, and a vertical axis orientation that is able to generate power using winds coming from any direction, a key element in harnessing energy from winds close to the ground. The system has a safe wind speed of more than 120mph (55 m/s) and an engineered lifetime of 20 years. Furthermore, customers benefit by saving money on electric bills and installation costs. The Boardwalk operates entirely off grid with a battery backup system that stores excess energy for future use, while considerable costs are saved during installation because no wires need to be buried to connect the lamp to the grid."With our Sanya and Boardwalk, customers are rapidly discovering that off-grid lighting is the most economical way to light roads, parking lots and parks,” Urban Green Energy CEO Nick Blitterswyk comments. “Once again we have been able to deliver an attractive and completely sustainable option that is both green and more affordable than the status quo."The Boardwalk is customizable based on customer preference and has an option to include customized advertising banners for owners to earn extra revenue or display an important message.

Kimberly-Clark High Capacity Hard Roll Towels, White (KIM02000)



Scott® paper towels always deliver superior value, quality and affordability. These paper towel rolls are economical, but extremely absorbent for drying hands or cleaning up liquid spills. These absorbent paper towels are also environmentally friendly, as they are made from a high percentage of recycled material. These paper towel rolls are excellent for both household and commercial use, but are optimal for commercial use where long-lasting towels are required (950 feet in length by 8" in width).  These hand paper towels are compatible with Kimberly-Clark® dispensers KCC09803  and KCC09765 (both sold separately).
