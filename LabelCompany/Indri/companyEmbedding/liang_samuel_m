7/22/2008 6:33:39 AM


CRESSKILL, N.J., July 22, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Vascular Therapies LLC, a vascular combination device company, today announced that it has appointed Samuel M. Liang as President and Chief Executive Officer effective immediately. Sriram S. Iyer, M.D., the company's founder, will remain as Chairman of the Board.

Liang, 45, joins Vascular Therapies from Cordis, a Johnson & Johnson company, where most recently he was Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. During over 24 years with Cordis he has held positions of increasing responsibility and leadership in the areas of strategy, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, new product development, field sales, corporate accounts, marketing, and general management.

``Sam brings wide-ranging experience, both domestic and international, in diversified medical devices and combination products. It's worth noting that, as Worldwide Vice President of the Cypher Programs and Global Stent Franchise, he was responsible for all aspects of the company's drug-eluting stent franchise and initiatives. This included the commercialization and launch of the first- and second-generation drug-eluting stent products, which earned an unprecedented incremental U.S. reimbursement that coincided with the product launch,'' said Dr. Iyer. ``We are delighted Sam has accepted this position and welcome him to the Vascular Therapies family.''

Added Liang: ``It is an honor to join Vascular Therapies. I am energized and excited to join Dr. Iyer and his dynamic and talented team that is developing solutions that will have immediate and significant impact in healthcare by addressing areas of unmet clinical need.''

Liang earned a Masters in Management from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University and a B.S.E. in mechanical engineering and material sciences from Duke University.

 Jun 04, 2010 | Justine Varieur Cadet  

 



 



 






 Bayer Medical Care has appointed Samuel M. Liang as incoming president and CEO of Medrad, a cardiovascular device company, upon the retirement of John Friel later this year. Liang will succeed Friel as of July 1.     Liang  has been president and CEO of Vascular Therapies, a start-up company in Totowa, N.J., that develops a combination drug-device product for surgery, since July 2008, Medrad reported.  
Previously, he spent 24 years at Cordis, a Johnson  & Johnson company, in engineering, international and commercial roles including vice president of marketing for Cordis Cardiology, worldwide vice president of commercial operations for Cordis Endovascular and disease state leader/general manager of Cordis Neurovascular.  
Liang also was vice president of the Cordis’ global stent franchise and worldwide vice president for Cypher programs, where he led the company’s stent franchise and its drug-eluting stent initiatives, including launching Cypher.
