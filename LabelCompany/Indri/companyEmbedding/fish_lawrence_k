Fishfinders (Sonar Only)





Get the underwater-viewing advantage.











From the launch of the first recreational sonar in 1957 to our current DownScan Imaging™ and award-winning Broadband Sounder technology, Lowrance continues to lead the way in helping anglers find fish and fish-holding structure.
Referred to as a fishfinder, graph, sounder or recreational sonar, these products provide anglers with the ability to locate and target open-water baitfish, game fish and cover. This underwater-viewing advantage helped launch sportfishing markets like never before, as anglers were able to better understand depth contours, bottom composition and structure location, plus how fish related to this environment.
Whether you are interested in a standalone fishfinder, fishfinder/chartplotter combo or a networkable multifunction display, Lowrance's wide range of solutions ensures that you have the best tools available for success on the water.
