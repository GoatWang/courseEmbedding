      “continue,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,”

      capital and business and consumer confidence; cyclicality and 
      seasonality of the non-residential and residential construction markets 
      and infrastructure spending; the risks of increasing competition in our 
      existing and future markets, including competition from both 
      manufacturers of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and 
      manufacturers of products using alternative materials; our ability to 
      continue to convert current demand for concrete, steel and PVC pipe 
      products into demand for our high performance thermoplastic corrugated 
      pipe and Allied Products; the effect of weather or seasonality; the loss 
      of any of our significant customers; the risks of doing business 
      internationally; the risks of conducting a portion of our operations 
      through joint ventures; our ability to expand into new geographic or 
      product markets; our ability to achieve the acquisition component of our 
      growth strategy; the risk associated with manufacturing processes; our 
      ability to manage our assets; the risks associated with our product 
      warranties; our ability to manage our supply purchasing and customer 
      credit policies; the risks associated with our self-insured programs; 
      our ability to control labor costs and to attract, train and retain 
      highly-qualified employees and key personnel; our ability to protect our 
      intellectual property rights; changes in laws and regulations, including 
      environmental laws and regulations; our ability to project product mix; 
      the risks associated with our current levels of indebtedness; our 
      ability to meet future capital requirements and fund our liquidity 
      needs; the risk that additional information may arise that would require 
      the Company to make additional adjustments or revisions or to restate 
      further the financial statements and other financial data for certain 
      prior periods and any future periods, any delay in the filing of any 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); the review 
      of potential weaknesses or deficiencies in the Company’s disclosure 
      controls and procedures, and discovering further weaknesses of which we 
      are not currently aware or which have not been detected; additional 
      uncertainties related to accounting issues generally and other risks and 
      uncertainties described in the Company’s filings with the SEC. New risks 
      and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for 
      the Company to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an 
      impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this press 
      release. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the 
      forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such 
      information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or 
      any other person that the Company’s expectations, objectives or plans 
      will be achieved in the timeframe anticipated or at all. Investors are 
      cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking 
      statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update 
      or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new

N-12®
N-12� pipe is the world standard for corrugated polyethylene drainage pipe. Introduced in 1987, N-12 dual wall pipe with its smooth interior wall and corrugated exterior wall, offers exceptional hydraulics and strength. Built using application specific high-density polyethylene, N-12 corrugated pipe also provides superior corrosion and abrasion resistance making it an excellent alternative to reinforced concrete and corrugated metal pipe. These properties have led to the increasing approval and acceptance of N-12 drainage pipe in storm water applications across the country.

Pipe
Since 1967, ADS has been the first choice in corrugated high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe for contractors throughout the United States. From single-wall pipe for agricultural, residential, highway culverts and recreational applications. In 1987, ADS introduced N-12� smooth interior dual wall pipe, which today is specified nationwide in 4" through 60" diameters for municipal storm drains and highway drainage. In 2008, ADS introduced N-12 HP and SaniTite HP smooth interior dual wall and triple wall pipes, in diameters 12� � 60�, manufactured exclusively from Polypropylene resin. ADS offers an extensive range of drainage products, including, soil-tight and watertight pipe. Due to its durability, high resistance to corrosion and chemicals, and load carrying capabilities, corrugated HDPE pipe has become the pipe of choice versus clay and metal varieties.The distinctive ADS green stripe on our pipe ensures that you are receiving the highest quality HDPE pipe available-drainage products that meet strict quality

Forward Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this press release may be deemed to be 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements include, but are not 
      limited to, statements regarding the timing for the Company’s issuance 
      of its unaudited financial results. These statements are not historical 
      facts but rather are based on the Company’s current expectations, 
      estimates and projections regarding the Company’s business, operations 
      and other factors relating thereto. Words such as “may,” “will,” 
      “could,” “would,” “should,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “potential,” 
      “continue,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” 
      “estimates,” “confident” and similar expressions are used to identify 
      these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements 
      relating to our operations and business include: fluctuations in the 
      price and availability of resins and other raw materials and our ability 
      to pass any increased costs of raw materials on to our customers in a 
      timely manner; volatility in general business and economic conditions in 
      the markets in which we operate, including, without limitation, factors 
      relating to availability of credit, interest rates, fluctuations in 
      capital and business and consumer confidence; cyclicality and 
      seasonality of the non-residential and residential construction markets 
      and infrastructure spending; the risks of increasing competition in our 
      existing and future markets, including competition from both 
      manufacturers of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and 
      manufacturers of products using alternative materials; our ability to 
      continue to convert current demand for concrete, steel and PVC pipe 
      products into demand for our high performance thermoplastic corrugated 
      pipe and Allied Products; the effect of weather or seasonality; the loss 
      of any of our significant customers; the risks of doing business 
      internationally; the risks of conducting a portion of our operations 
      through joint ventures; our ability to expand into new geographic or 
      product markets; our ability to achieve the acquisition component of our 
      growth strategy; the risk associated with manufacturing processes; our 
      ability to manage our assets; the risks associated with our product 
      warranties; our ability to manage our supply purchasing and customer 
      credit policies; the risks associated with our self-insured programs; 
      our ability to control labor costs and to attract, train and retain 
      highly-qualified employees and key personnel; our ability to protect our 
      intellectual property rights; changes in laws and regulations, including 
      environmental laws and regulations; our ability to project product mix; 
      the risks associated with our current levels of indebtedness; our 
      ability to meet future capital requirements and fund our liquidity 
      needs; the risk that additional information may arise that would require 
      the Company to make additional adjustments or revisions or to restate 
      further the financial statements and other financial data for certain 
      prior periods and any future periods, any delay in the filing of any 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); the review 
      of potential weaknesses or deficiencies in the Company’s disclosure 
      controls and procedures, and discovering further weaknesses of which we 
      are not currently aware or which have not been detected; additional 
      uncertainties related to accounting issues generally and other risks and 
      uncertainties described in the Company’s filings with the SEC. New risks 
      and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for 
      the Company to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an 
      impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this press 
      release. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
