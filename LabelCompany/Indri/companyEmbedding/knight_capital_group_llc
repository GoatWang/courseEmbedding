KCG Comment Letter to SEC on CHX Liquidity Taking Access Delay

	KCG is generally supportive of initiatives designed to encourage liquidity provision. We agree with CHX that the LTAD would encourage liquidity providers to make tighter and deeper markets on the Exchange, but we also acknowledge certain potential side effects highlighted by several commenters including that the speed bump might render CHX quotations somewhat less accessible.

The Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading.[1] With its high-frequency trading algorithms Knight was the largest trader in U.S. equities, with a market share of 17.3% on NYSE and 16.9% on NASDAQ.[2] The company agreed to be acquired by Getco LLC in December 2012 after an August 2012 trading error lost $460 million. The merger was completed in July 2013, forming KCG Holdings.

Company[edit]
Knight was formerly known as Knight/Trimark Group, Inc. and Knight Trading Group, Inc. Initially, Knight Trading group had multiple offices located in the United States and in other cities around the world. Knight's Asset Management offices were headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with offices in Hong Kong, China, and London.
Activities[edit]
Knight's largest business is market making in U.S. equities.[3] Its Electronic Trading Group (ETG) covers more than 19,000 U.S. securities with an average daily trading volume of more than 21 billion dollars (May 2012).[4] Furthermore, Knight makes markets in U.S. options and European equities.
In 2002, Knight paid $1.5 million to settle regulatory charges of violations such as not respecting posted quotes. Knight neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[5] In 2004, the company paid a $79 million settlement to customers whom they had overcharged.[6] In 2008, Knight traded an average of 3.97 billion shares per day.[7] In 2011, the company was worth $1.5 billion and employed approximately 1450 people.[8]
Offices[edit]
Knight is headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. It has many offices in other US locations, as well as in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.[9]
Operating Subsidiaries[edit]
Knight Capital Group operates in three segments: equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities, and corporate. Current operating business subsidiaries include Knight Capital Americas, L.P., Knight Execution & Clearing Services LLC, Knight Capital Europe Limited and Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc.[10] Knight Capital Group discontinued operations of its asset management segment in 2009 when its subsidiary, Deephaven Capital Management, sold most of its assets to Stark & Roth, LLC. [11]
2012 stock trading disruption[edit]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital deployed untested software to a production environment which contained an obsolete function. The incident happened due to a technician forgetting to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers, which was Knight's automated routing system for equity orders. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'. Power Peg was designed to move stock prices higher and lower in order to verify the behavior of trading algorithms in a controlled environment.[12] Therefore, orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server.[13] When released into production, Knight's trading activities caused a major disruption in the prices of 148 companies listed at the New York Stock Exchange, thus, for example, shares of Wizzard Software Corporation went from $3.50 to $14.76. For the 212 incoming parent orders that were processed by the defective Power Peg code, Knight Capital sent millions of child orders, resulting in 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares in approximately 45 minutes.[13] Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440 million. This caused Knight Capital's stock price to collapse, sending shares lower by over 70% from before the announcement. The nature of the Knight Capital's unusual trading activity was described as a "technology breakdown".[14][15]
On Sunday, August 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from half a dozen investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error. Jefferies' CEO, Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.[16][17] The financing would be in the form of convertible securities, bonds that turn into equity in the company at a fixed price in the future.[18]
The incident was embarrassing for Knight CEO Thomas Joyce, who was an outspoken critic of Nasdaq's handling of Facebook's IPO.[19] On the same day the company's stock plunged 33 percent, to $3.39; by the next day 75 percent of Knight's equity value had been erased.[20]

Company[edit]
Knight was formerly known as Knight/Trimark Group, Inc. and Knight Trading Group, Inc. Initially, Knight Trading group had multiple offices located in the United States and in other cities around the world. Knight's Asset Management offices were headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with offices in Hong Kong, China, and London.
Activities[edit]
Knight's largest business is market making in U.S. equities.[3] Its Electronic Trading Group (ETG) covers more than 19,000 U.S. securities with an average daily trading volume of more than 21 billion dollars (May 2012).[4] Furthermore, Knight makes markets in U.S. options and European equities.
In 2002, Knight paid $1.5 million to settle regulatory charges of violations such as not respecting posted quotes. Knight neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[5] In 2004, the company paid a $79 million settlement to customers whom they had overcharged.[6] In 2008, Knight traded an average of 3.97 billion shares per day.[7] In 2011, the company was worth $1.5 billion and employed approximately 1450 people.[8]
Offices[edit]
Knight is headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. It has many offices in other US locations, as well as in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.[9]
Operating Subsidiaries[edit]
Knight Capital Group operates in three segments: equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities, and corporate. Current operating business subsidiaries include Knight Capital Americas, L.P., Knight Execution & Clearing Services LLC, Knight Capital Europe Limited and Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc.[10] Knight Capital Group discontinued operations of its asset management segment in 2009 when its subsidiary, Deephaven Capital Management, sold most of its assets to Stark & Roth, LLC. [11]
2012 stock trading disruption[edit]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital deployed untested software to a production environment which contained an obsolete function. The incident happened due to a technician forgetting to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers, which was Knight's automated routing system for equity orders. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'. Power Peg was designed to move stock prices higher and lower in order to verify the behavior of trading algorithms in a controlled environment.[12] Therefore, orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server.[13] When released into production, Knight's trading activities caused a major disruption in the prices of 148 companies listed at the New York Stock Exchange, thus, for example, shares of Wizzard Software Corporation went from $3.50 to $14.76. For the 212 incoming parent orders that were processed by the defective Power Peg code, Knight Capital sent millions of child orders, resulting in 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares in approximately 45 minutes.[13] Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440 million. This caused Knight Capital's stock price to collapse, sending shares lower by over 70% from before the announcement. The nature of the Knight Capital's unusual trading activity was described as a "technology breakdown".[14][15]
On Sunday, August 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from half a dozen investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error. Jefferies' CEO, Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.[16][17] The financing would be in the form of convertible securities, bonds that turn into equity in the company at a fixed price in the future.[18]
The incident was embarrassing for Knight CEO Thomas Joyce, who was an outspoken critic of Nasdaq's handling of Facebook's IPO.[19] On the same day the company's stock plunged 33 percent, to $3.39; by the next day 75 percent of Knight's equity value had been erased.[20]

The Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading.[1] With its high-frequency trading algorithms Knight was the largest trader in U.S. equities, with a market share of 17.3% on NYSE and 16.9% on NASDAQ.[2] The company agreed to be acquired by Getco LLC in December 2012 after an August 2012 trading error lost $460 million. The merger was completed in July 2013, forming KCG Holdings.

Company[edit]
Knight was formerly known as Knight/Trimark Group, Inc. and Knight Trading Group, Inc. Initially, Knight Trading group had multiple offices located in the United States and in other cities around the world. Knight's Asset Management offices were headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with offices in Hong Kong, China, and London.
Activities[edit]
Knight's largest business is market making in U.S. equities.[3] Its Electronic Trading Group (ETG) covers more than 19,000 U.S. securities with an average daily trading volume of more than 21 billion dollars (May 2012).[4] Furthermore, Knight makes markets in U.S. options and European equities.
In 2002, Knight paid $1.5 million to settle regulatory charges of violations such as not respecting posted quotes. Knight neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[5] In 2004, the company paid a $79 million settlement to customers whom they had overcharged.[6] In 2008, Knight traded an average of 3.97 billion shares per day.[7] In 2011, the company was worth $1.5 billion and employed approximately 1450 people.[8]
Offices[edit]
Knight is headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. It has many offices in other US locations, as well as in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.[9]
Operating Subsidiaries[edit]
Knight Capital Group operates in three segments: equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities, and corporate. Current operating business subsidiaries include Knight Capital Americas, L.P., Knight Execution & Clearing Services LLC, Knight Capital Europe Limited and Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc.[10] Knight Capital Group discontinued operations of its asset management segment in 2009 when its subsidiary, Deephaven Capital Management, sold most of its assets to Stark & Roth, LLC. [11]
2012 stock trading disruption[edit]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital deployed untested software to a production environment which contained an obsolete function. The incident happened due to a technician forgetting to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers, which was Knight's automated routing system for equity orders. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'. Power Peg was designed to move stock prices higher and lower in order to verify the behavior of trading algorithms in a controlled environment.[12] Therefore, orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server.[13] When released into production, Knight's trading activities caused a major disruption in the prices of 148 companies listed at the New York Stock Exchange, thus, for example, shares of Wizzard Software Corporation went from $3.50 to $14.76. For the 212 incoming parent orders that were processed by the defective Power Peg code, Knight Capital sent millions of child orders, resulting in 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares in approximately 45 minutes.[13] Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440 million. This caused Knight Capital's stock price to collapse, sending shares lower by over 70% from before the announcement. The nature of the Knight Capital's unusual trading activity was described as a "technology breakdown".[14][15]
On Sunday, August 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from half a dozen investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error. Jefferies' CEO, Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.[16][17] The financing would be in the form of convertible securities, bonds that turn into equity in the company at a fixed price in the future.[18]
The incident was embarrassing for Knight CEO Thomas Joyce, who was an outspoken critic of Nasdaq's handling of Facebook's IPO.[19] On the same day the company's stock plunged 33 percent, to $3.39; by the next day 75 percent of Knight's equity value had been erased.[20]

The Knight Capital Group was an American global financial services firm engaging in market making, electronic execution, and institutional sales and trading.[1] With its high-frequency trading algorithms Knight was the largest trader in U.S. equities, with a market share of 17.3% on NYSE and 16.9% on NASDAQ.[2] The company agreed to be acquired by Getco LLC in December 2012 after an August 2012 trading error lost $460 million. The merger was completed in July 2013, forming KCG Holdings.

Company[edit]
Knight was formerly known as Knight/Trimark Group, Inc. and Knight Trading Group, Inc. Initially, Knight Trading group had multiple offices located in the United States and in other cities around the world. Knight's Asset Management offices were headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, with offices in Hong Kong, China, and London.
Activities[edit]
Knight's largest business is market making in U.S. equities.[3] Its Electronic Trading Group (ETG) covers more than 19,000 U.S. securities with an average daily trading volume of more than 21 billion dollars (May 2012).[4] Furthermore, Knight makes markets in U.S. options and European equities.
In 2002, Knight paid $1.5 million to settle regulatory charges of violations such as not respecting posted quotes. Knight neither admitted nor denied the allegations.[5] In 2004, the company paid a $79 million settlement to customers whom they had overcharged.[6] In 2008, Knight traded an average of 3.97 billion shares per day.[7] In 2011, the company was worth $1.5 billion and employed approximately 1450 people.[8]
Offices[edit]
Knight is headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. It has many offices in other US locations, as well as in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.[9]
Operating Subsidiaries[edit]
Knight Capital Group operates in three segments: equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities, and corporate. Current operating business subsidiaries include Knight Capital Americas, L.P., Knight Execution & Clearing Services LLC, Knight Capital Europe Limited and Hotspot FX Holdings, Inc.[10] Knight Capital Group discontinued operations of its asset management segment in 2009 when its subsidiary, Deephaven Capital Management, sold most of its assets to Stark & Roth, LLC. [11]
2012 stock trading disruption[edit]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital deployed untested software to a production environment which contained an obsolete function. The incident happened due to a technician forgetting to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code to one of the eight SMARS computer servers, which was Knight's automated routing system for equity orders. RLP code repurposed a flag that was formerly used to activate the old function known as 'Power Peg'. Power Peg was designed to move stock prices higher and lower in order to verify the behavior of trading algorithms in a controlled environment.[12] Therefore, orders sent with the repurposed flag to the eighth server triggered the defective Power Peg code still present on that server.[13] When released into production, Knight's trading activities caused a major disruption in the prices of 148 companies listed at the New York Stock Exchange, thus, for example, shares of Wizzard Software Corporation went from $3.50 to $14.76. For the 212 incoming parent orders that were processed by the defective Power Peg code, Knight Capital sent millions of child orders, resulting in 4 million executions in 154 stocks for more than 397 million shares in approximately 45 minutes.[13] Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440 million. This caused Knight Capital's stock price to collapse, sending shares lower by over 70% from before the announcement. The nature of the Knight Capital's unusual trading activity was described as a "technology breakdown".[14][15]
On Sunday, August 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from half a dozen investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error. Jefferies' CEO, Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.[16][17] The financing would be in the form of convertible securities, bonds that turn into equity in the company at a fixed price in the future.[18]
The incident was embarrassing for Knight CEO Thomas Joyce, who was an outspoken critic of Nasdaq's handling of Facebook's IPO.[19] On the same day the company's stock plunged 33 percent, to $3.39; by the next day 75 percent of Knight's equity value had been erased.[20]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
