                    The ratings are by Standard & Poor's. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), 
                    of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) 
                    to D (lowest). Investment grade is defined as those issuers that have a long-term credit rating of BBB- or higher. Sub-investment grade ratings 
                    are those rated BB+ or lower.  "NR" indicates no rating. The credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the 
                    underlying securities in the fund, and not to the fund or its shares. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities 
                    appear under "Government". Credit ratings are subject to change.
                
	








Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
A measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield.  It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements.


6
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


7
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


8
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

    The debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund's portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.


    A portion of the fund's managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage-backed securities. Such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non-payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.
