      As part of the planned succession, Mr. Murphy has notified the Company 
      that he plans to relocate permanently to Denver, CO and will resign on 
      July 7, 2017, at which time Mr. Cappasola will fully assume his new 
      position as Chief Executive Officer and director.
    

      Mr. Cappasola joined Del Taco in a senior leadership role in 2008. He 
      has been Del Taco’s President since January 2017 and Chief Brand Officer 
      since February 2011. He previously served as Executive Vice President 
      and Chief Brand Officer, leading Del Taco’s efforts in brand strategy,

      J.B. Murphy, III has been Del Taco’s Chief Executive Officer since 
      February 2009 and served as President from February 2009 through

      Chairman of the Board Lawrence F. Levy commented, “John is a dynamic, 
      people-oriented brand leader who understands strategy and driving 
      business results. John was instrumental in the development of our 
      successful Combined Solutions strategy that has established a solid 
      foundation for the brand and produced some of the top results in the

      organization. The entire Del Taco family looks forward to working with 
      John in this natural evolution of his leadership role.”
    

      Levy added, “We thank Paul for his many contributions to Del Taco. Paul 
      has developed a high-performing culture and an outstanding leadership 
      team that is poised to continue delivering superior performance. We 
      deeply appreciate Paul for his leadership and commitment to Del Taco and 
      wish him all the best.”
    

      Chief Executive Officer Paul J.B. Murphy, III stated, “It has been my 
      privilege and honor to be part of Del Taco for the past eight years, and 
      I am confident in the strong team we have assembled to execute on the 
      growing opportunity ahead of this beloved brand. John and I have been 
      working together preparing for this transition and I can confidently say 
      that the company could not ask for a better person to lead it into its 
      next phase of growth. John will continue to be a driving force pushing 
      the brand to evolve to meet ever-changing consumer needs and ensuring 
      that our operations teams are set up to successfully deliver on that 
      brand promise.”
    

      Incoming Chief Executive Officer John D. Cappasola, Jr. said, “I am 
      excited to assume this new role which I feel is a once in a lifetime 
      career opportunity. Del Taco is a unique company with a deep rooted 
      culture and a great team of people who care about elevating this iconic 
      brand and each other. Working side by side with Paul over the past 
      several years has uniquely prepared me for this role and I am confident 
      that our team is going to build upon what we have already accomplished 
      and take Del Taco to new heights.”

      of “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, 
      without limitation, information concerning Del Taco’s possible or 
      assumed future results of operations, business strategies, competitive 
      position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities and the 
      effects of regulation. These statements are based Del Taco’s 
      management’s current expectations and beliefs, as well as a number of 
      assumptions concerning future events. When used in this press release, 
      the words “estimates,” “projected,” “expects,” “anticipates,”

      track” and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the

      to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other 
      important factors, many of which are outside Del Taco’s management’s 
      control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the 
      results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These risks 
      included, without limitation, consumer demand, our inability to 
      successfully open company-operated or franchised restaurants or 
      establish new markets, competition in our markets, our inability to grow 
      and manage growth profitably, adverse changes in food and supply costs, 
      our inability to access additional capital, changes in applicable laws 
      or regulations, food safety and foodborne illness concerns, our 
      inability to manage existing and to obtain additional franchisees, our 
      inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, our inability to 
      profitably expand into new markets, changes in, or the discontinuation 
      of, the Company’s repurchase program, and the possibility that we may be 
      adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive 
      factors. Additional risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed 
      in Del Taco’s reports filed with the SEC, including under Item 1A. Risk 
      Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 
      2017, and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov 
      and the Company’s website at www.deltaco.com.

      date of this release. Del Taco undertakes no obligation to update its 
      forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the 
      date of this release or otherwise.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The entire Del Taco family looks forward to working with John in this natural evolution of his leadership role.”

John and I have been working together preparing for this transition and I can confidently say that the company could not ask for a better person to lead it into its next phase of growth. John will continue to be a driving force pushing the brand to evolve to meet ever-changing consumer needs and ensuring that our operations teams are set up to successfully deliver on that brand promise.”
Incoming Chief Executive Officer John D. Cappasola, Jr. said, “I am excited to assume this new role which I feel is a once in a lifetime career opportunity. Del Taco is a unique company with a deep rooted culture and a great team of people who care about elevating this iconic brand and each other. Working side by side with Paul over the past several years has uniquely prepared me for this role and I am confident that our team is going to build upon what we have already accomplished and take Del Taco to new heights.”
