(a)

      
Prospectus.  As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, a
final prospectus supplement relating to the Rights Offering (the
“ Prospectus Supplement ”), which will
supplement the base prospectus contained in the Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-214043) (the “
Registration Statement ”) filed by the Company with
the SEC and declared effective on November 2, 2016.  Such base
prospectus, in the form in which it appears in the Registration
Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement is
hereinafter referred to as the “Prospectus.”  The
Prospectus Supplement shall be provided to the Standby Purchasers
and their counsel prior to its filing with the SEC, and the Standby
Purchasers and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Prospectus Supplement
(and any post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement
and any other amendments or supplements to the Prospectus that may
be filed prior to the Closing or otherwise in connection with the
Rights Offering).  The Prospectus Supplement shall reflect the
terms of the Rights Offering as set forth in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the recitals set forth
above).
 
(b)

   
Rights Offering .  Promptly following the date on which
the Prospectus Supplement is filed with the SEC, the Company shall
distribute the Prospectus to the Company’s stockholders of
record as of the Record Date and thereafter promptly commence the
Rights Offering upon the terms set forth herein.  The Rights
offering shall remain open for at least twenty (20) days, but no
more than thirty (30) days, or such longer period as the Board of
Directors of the Company determines is necessary to comply with
applicable law.  Prior to the termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall not amend any of the terms of the Rights Offering
described in this Agreement (including, without limitation, in the
recitals set forth above), terminate the Rights Offering or waive
any material conditions to the closing of the Rights Offering, in
each case, without the prior written consent of all of the Standby
Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights
Offering, the Company shall effect the closing of the Rights
Offering as promptly as practicable following the end of the
Subscription Period. The closing of the Rights Offering shall occur
at the time, for the Subscription Price and in the manner and on
the terms set forth in the Prospectus Supplement, which terms shall
be consistent with this Agreement in all respects.
 
 
(c)

   
Standby Purchase Commitment . If upon the expiration of the
Rights Offering there are any Remaining Shares, each Standby
Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company
agrees to issue and sell to such Standby Purchaser (or its
designee), at the Subscription Price, its Pro Rata Portion of the
lesser of the First Standby Shares and the Remaining Shares. If the
number of Remaining Shares is greater than the number of First
Standby Shares, and if following exercise by the Company’s
stockholders of the Oversubscription Rights and after giving effect
to all of the Standby Purchasers’ purchase of shares pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence there are Unsubscribed Shares
available, each Standby Purchaser agrees to purchase from the
Company, and the Company agrees to issue and sell to such Standby
Purchaser (or its designee), at the Subscription Price, its Pro
Rata Share of the lesser of such remaining Unsubscribed Shares and
the Maximum Additional Standby Shares (the lesser of the foregoing
(if any), together with the First Standby Shares that the Standby
Purchasers are  obligated to purchase hereunder, the “
Standby Shares ”). Each Standby Purchaser acknowledges
that the precise number of Standby Shares it will be obligated to
purchase hereunder is yet to be determined, and could be its Pro
Rata Portion of the full number of First Standby Shares and Maximum
Additional Standby Shares. The offering of the Standby Shares to
the Standby Purchasers is referred to herein as the “
Standby Offering ”.

 
2

 





 
(d)

   
Amount of Standby Shares . During the Rights Offering, the
Company will regularly advise each Standby Purchaser of the number
of shares of Common Stock for which stockholders have exercised
their Rights and will promptly respond to inquiries from any
Standby Purchaser in that regard. Promptly, but in no event more
than two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the Rights
Offering, the Company will determine the number of Standby Shares
and notify each Standby Purchaser in writing of the number of
Standby Shares and the aggregate purchase price for such shares,
determined as provided herein (the “ Closing Purchase
Amount ”), as well as each Standby Purchaser’s Pro
Rata Portion of the Standby Shares and Closing Purchase

The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

This Amendment No. 4 (this “Amendment”) to Schedule 13D amends the Schedule 13D (the “Schedule 13D”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by Donald R. Wilson, Jr. (“Wilson”), 2012 DOOH Investments LLC (“DOOH Investments”) and DOOH Investment Manager LLC (“DOOH Manager”) on December 26, 2012, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on January 14, 2013, Amendment No. 2 to the Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on February 12, 2013 and Amendment No. 3 to the Schedule 13D filed with the SEC on May 22, 2013 by Wilson, DOOH Investments, DOOH Manager, DRW Commodities, LLC (“DRW Commodities”) and DRW Holdings, LLC (“DRW Holdings”), with respect to the securities of SCG Financial Acquisition Corp. (the “Issuer”).  The purpose of this Amendment is to report (i) the current exercisability of warrants entitling the holder to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,533,333 shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Issuer, which became exercisable following the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants and the availability of a prospectus relating thereto;  and (ii) changes in the percentage of the Issuer’s outstanding common stock beneficially owned by the reporting persons as a result of changes in the number of outstanding shares of the Issuer’s common stock.    This Amendment also discloses the acquisition of 120,000 shares of Common Stock from the Issuer.  Except as otherwise indicated herein, the information in the Schedule 13D, as previously amended, remains unchanged.  Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D.


Item 3.         Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration


Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following:


On August 6, 2013, the Issuer and DOOH Investments entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “Management Services Agreement”), pursuant to which DOOH Investments agreed to provide management consulting services to the Issuer and its subsidiaries with respect to financing, acquisitions, sourcing, diligence and strategic planning, in each case as requested by the Executive Chairman of the Issuer.  In addition to an annual management fee, the Issuer issued 120,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Consulting Shares”) to DOOH Investments in consideration for DOOH Investments’ services.
 

Item 4.         Purpose of Transaction


Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following:


DOOH Investments acquired the Management Services Shares in consideration for the services described in Item 3 of this report.


Item 5.         Interest in Securities of the Issuer


Items 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) of the Schedule 13D are hereby amended and restated as follows:

 




  


  





  


 

(a)           Based on information contained in the Issuer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, 11,284,593 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock were outstanding as of August 12, 2013.  Based on the foregoing, (i) the aggregate of 9,131,593 shares of Common Stock that Wilson may be deemed to beneficially own represent approximately 57.7% of the Common Stock outstanding; (ii) the 6,777,143 shares of Common Stock that DOOH Investments and DOOH Manager may be deemed to beneficially own represent approximately 42.8% of the Common Stock outstanding; (iii) the 2,354,450 shares of Common Stock that DRW Commodities and DRW Holdings may be deemed to beneficially own represent approximately 20.8% of the Common Stock outstanding; and (iv) the 9,131,593 shares of Common Stock that all of the Reporting Persons collectively beneficially own represent approximately 57.7% of the Common Stock outstanding.


(b)           Pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, DOOH Investments possesses voting discretion (subject to voting restrictions contained in the Letter Agreement) with respect to the 761,905 Founder Shares that are subject to the Voting Rights and exercises the Voting Rights through DOOH Manager, which it has appointed as a manager of Holdings.  Wilson ultimately exercises voting discretion on behalf of DOOH Manager, in his capacity as its sole manager.  As a result, each of Wilson, DOOH Manager and DOOH Investments may be deemed to have sole power to direct the vote of the 761,905 Founder Shares that are subject to the Voting Rights and therefore beneficially own such shares.   The two managers of Holdings, DOOH Manager and Gregory H. Sachs (“Sachs”), share the power to dispose, or direct the disposition, of the 1,523,810 shares of Common Stock held directly by Holdings, subject to restrictions on transfer set forth in the Letter Agreement, as well as the 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants (as defined in Item 6 below).   Wilson, in his capacity as the sole manager of DOOH Manager, may also be deemed to share investment discretion with respect all of the 1,523,810 Founder Shares and the 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants.


Each of Wilson, DOOH Manager and DOOH Investments may also be deemed to have sole voting and sole dispositive power with respect to the 720,000 shares of Common Stock held by DOOH Investments and the 533,333 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Note Conversion Warrants.


In addition, Wilson is the sole manager of DRW Commodities and DRW Holdings, which owns 100% of the outstanding equity of DRW Commodities, and, as such, each of Wilson, DRW Holdings and DRW Commodities may be deemed to have sole voting and sole dispositive power with respect to the 2,354,450 shares of Common Stock held by DRW Commodities.


 (c)           Except as set forth in Item 3, no Reporting Person has effected any transaction in the Common Stock during the past 60 days.

 


  


  





  


 

Item 6.         Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer


Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by replacing the disclosure therein under the captions “Sponsor Warrants” and “Note Conversion Warrants” with the following:


Warrants


Holdings holds warrants entitling the holder to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock (the “Sponsor Warrants”) at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.  The Sponsor Warrants were not exercisable in any event prior to the 30th day after the consummation of the Issuer’s initial business combination, or May 8, 2013, and remained unexercisable until there was an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them was available.  Such a registration statement was declared effective on July 18, 2013 and such a prospectus became available on July 22, 2013.


On April 8, 2013, the Issuer issued to DOOH Investments warrants entitling the holder to purchase up to an aggregate of 533,333 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock (the “Note Conversion Warrants”) at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.  The Note Conversion Warrants were issued upon the conversion of a promissory note issued by the Issuer to Holdings, and subsequently assigned to DOOH Investments, in the principal amount of $400,000.  The Note Conversion Warrants were not exercisable until there was an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Note Conversion Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them was available.  Such a registration statement was declared effective on July 18, 2013 and such a prospectus became available on July 22, 2013.


The Sponsor Warrant and the Note Conversion Warrant (collectively, the “Warrants”) entitle the registered holder to purchase Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described below, and are currently exercisable, provided that there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available.


The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants are required to be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation involving the Issuer.  However, the exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Common Stock at a price below the Warrant exercise price.


Under the terms of the Warrants, the Issuer agreed to use its best efforts to file a registration statement covering the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock until the expiration of the Warrants.  During any period in which a prospectus relating to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants is not current, the Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis to the extent the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to such exercise is exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the Securities Act or another exemption from registration.  The terms of the Warrants also provide that in no event will the Issuer be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise.
 



  


  





  





 
Management Services Agreement


On August 6, 2013, the Issuer and DOOH Investments entered into the Management Services Agreement, pursuant to which DOOH Investments agreed to provide management consulting services to the Issuer and its subsidiaries with respect to financing, acquisitions, sourcing, diligence and strategic planning, in each case as requested by the Executive Chairman of the Issuer.  In addition to an annual management fee, the Issuer issued the Consulting Shares to DOOH Investments in consideration for DOOH Investments’ services.


Item 7.       Material to Be Filed as Exhibits


Item 7 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following as Exhibits 99.15 and 99.16:
 
Exhibit 99.15  Management Services Agreement, dated as of August 14, 2013, between RMG Networks Holding Corporation and 2012 DOOH Investments, LLC (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.12 to the Issuer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 14, 2013).

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
