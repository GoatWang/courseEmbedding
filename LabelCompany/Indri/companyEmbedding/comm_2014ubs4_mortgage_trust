                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                    Global Credit Research - 16 Jun 2017
                







Approximately $871.3 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 16, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on six classes in COMM 
2014-UBS4 Mortgage Trust as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
24, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
24, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)

Cl. A-5, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
24, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Jun 
24, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings of six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value 
(LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio 
(DSCR), and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf) are 
within acceptable ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.9% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.7% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.8% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.7% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2.4% to $1.26 
billion from $1.29 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 91 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10.2% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 47.4% 
of the pool. Five loans, constituting 2.5% 
of the pool, have defeased and are secured by US government securities.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 28, 
compared to 30 at Moody's last review.




Four loans, constituting 11.3% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Two loans, constituting 1.9% of the pool, are 
currently in special servicing. The largest specially serviced 
loan is the Showcase at Indio Loan ($21.3 million -- 
1.7% of the pool), which is secured by a 157,500 
SF anchored retail center located in Indio, California, approximately 
25 miles southeast of Palm Springs. The loan was transferred to 
the special servicer in June 2016 due to imminent monetary default due 
to the departure of property's shadow anchor, Target. 
Twelve tenants have co-tenancy clauses tied to Target's tenancy. 
Target owns their box and is not part of the collateral. The property 
was 91% leased as of December 2016.




The other specially serviced loan is secured by a limited service hotel 
in Baton Rouge, Lousiana. Moody's estimates an aggregate 
$13.1 million loss for specially serviced loans (54% 
expected loss on average).




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 91% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 90% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 111%, compared 
to 112% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 21.6% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.7%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.40X and 0.96X, 
respectively, compared to 1.42X and 0.94X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 23.7% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the State Farm Portfolio Loan ($128.0 
million -- 10.2% of the pool), which represents 
a participation interest in a $383.5 million first mortgage 
loan. The loan is collateralized by 14 suburban office properties 
that are 100% leased and occupied by State Farm, pursuant 
to individual leases executed by State Farm in November 2013. Each 
lease has a 15-year term, with the exception of two properties; 
Greeley South and Greeley North, which have 10-year and 5-year 
lease terms, respectively. The 14 properties are located 
across 11 states, with no single market accounting for more than 
15% of the portfolio's gross leasable area (GLA). 
The loan is structured with an Anticipated Repayment Date (ARD) structure, 
whereby if the loan is not repaid in full by April 6, 2024, 
all excess cash flow after debt service will be swept and applied to pay 
down principal. Given the strength of the State Farm tenant and 
the hyper-amortizing ARD feature of the loan structure, there 
is a high probability that the loan will be of lower leverage at the tenant's 
maturity date in November 2028, even if the tenant elected to vacate 
its premises. Considering these factors, Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 125% and 
0.89X, respectively, the same as at Moody's last 
review.




The second largest loan is the 597 Fifth Avenue Loan ($105.0 
million -- 8.3% of the pool), which is secured 
by two commercial buildings located in New York City's Fifth Avenue 
retail corridor. The collateral consists of 597 Broadway and 3 
East 48th Street which according to the most-recent rent roll, 
total roughly 86,000 SF. The 597 Broadway property is a 12-story 
building with frontage along Fifth Avenue. The largest retail tenant 
at securitization, Sephora, represented 12,229 SF and 
vacated the property in March 2017. The 3 East 48th Street property 
is a six-story building with frontage along 48th Street. 
The properties were a combined 70% leased prior to the departure 
of Sephora. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 121% and 0.68X, 
respectively, compared to 118% and 0.71X at the last 
review.




The third largest loan is the Refinery Hotel Loan ($65.3 
million -- 5.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 197-key full-service boutique hotel located on West 
38th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in New York City's Fashion 
District. The sponsor purchased the hotel in 2009 and subsequently 
undertook a $59.4 million ($453,579 per key) 
renovation of the property. Amenities include the Park Quinn Restaurant, 
Winnie's Lobby Bar, the Refinery Rooftop Bar and Lounge, 
a fitness center, and a business center. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 97% and 1.15X, respectively, 
compared to 99% and 1.12X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

The ratings on the six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.7% 
of the current balance, compared to 3.9% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.7% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.9% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 30, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 10, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.27 
billion from $1.29 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 91 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 47% of the pool.




Five loans, constituting 10% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool. Two loans are in special 
servicing comprising less than 1% of the pool balance.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 95% of the 
pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 112%, 
compared to 113% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 7% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.7%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.42X and 0.94X, 
respectively, compared to 1.42X and 0.93X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 24% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the State Farm Portfolio Loan ($128 million 
-- 10.1% of the pool), which represents a 33% 
participation interest in a $383.5 million mortgage loan. 
There is also $34.9 million of mezzanine debt held outside 
the trust. The loan is collateralized by fee simple interests in 
14 suburban office properties. All of the State Farm Portfolio 
properties are 100% leased and occupied by State Farm pursuant 
to individual leases executed by State Farm in November 2013. Each 
lease has a 15-year term, except two properties the Greeley 
South property and the Greeley North property, which have a 10-year 
term and 5-year term, respectively. The 14 properties 
are located across 11 states, with no single market accounting for 
more than 15% of the portfolio's gross leasable area (GLA). 
The loan is structured with an Anticipated Repayment Date ("ARD") structure, 
whereby if the loan is not repaid in full by April 6, 2024, 
all excess cash flow after debt service will be swept and applied to pay 
down principal. Given the financial strength of the State Farm 
tenant and the hyper-amortizing ARD feature of the loan structure, 
there is a high probability that the loan will be of lower leverage at 
the tenant's lease maturity date in November 2028, even if the tenant 
elected to vacate its premises. Considering these additional factors, 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 125% and 0.89X, 
respectively.




The second largest loan is 597 Fifth Avenue Loan ($105 million 
-- 8.3% of the pool) which is secured by the borrower's 
interest in two commercial buildings containing retail and office space 
located in New York, NY. The properties total 80,000 
square foot (SF) and consist of 597 Fifth Avenue (a 12-story building 
totaling 80,032 SF) and 3 East 48th Street (a six-story building 
with frontage along East 48th Street). As of March 2016, 
the properties were a combined 65% leased, compared to 46% 
leased as of December 2014 and 52% at securitization. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 118% and 0.71X, respectively, 
the same as at last review.




The third largest loan is the Refinery Hotel Loan ($67 million 
-- 5.3% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 197-room boutique hotel located near Bryant Park in Midtown 
Manhattan. For the running 12 months as of March 2016, STR 
reported occupancy of 91% and ADR of $347 for a RevPar of 
$245. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 99% and 1.12X, 
respectively, compared to 101% and 1.09X at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on six P&I classes, Classes A-1 through A-5, 
were affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's 
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service 
coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), 
are within acceptable ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.0% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of base 
expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan pay downs or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.


Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit / Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, 
where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration 
has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including 
the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Conduit Loan 
Herf of 30, the same as at securitization.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 12, 2015 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.28 
billion from $1.29 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 91 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 47% of the pool. The pool has no defeased 
loans or loans with structured credit assessments.




Seven loans, constituting 12% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans that 
meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE 
Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's 
ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist 
to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool and there are no loans currently 
in special servicing.




Moody's received full and partial year 2014 operating results for 73% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 112.5%, 
compared to 113.2% at securitization. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 5.2% 
to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.42X and 0.93X, 
respectively, the similar to securitization. Moody's actual 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. 
Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% 
stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 23.6% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the State Farm Portfolio Loan ($128.0 
million -- 10.0% of the pool), which represents 
a 33% participation interest in a $383.5 million 
mortgage. There is also $34.9 million of mezzanine 
debt held outside the trust. The loan is collateralized by fee 
simple interests in 14 suburban office properties. All of the State 
Farm Portfolio properties are 100% leased and occupied by State 
Farm pursuant to individual leases executed by State Farm in November 
2013. Each lease has a 15-year term, except the Greeley 
South property and the Greeley North property, which have a 10-year 
term and 5-year term, respectively. The 14 properties 
are located across 11 states, with no single market accounting for 
more than 15% of the portfolio's gross leasable area (GLA). 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 133% and 0.89X, 
respectively, the same as at securitization.




The second largest loan is 597 Fifth Avenue Loan ($105.0 
million -- 8.2% of the pool) which is secured by the 
borrower's interest in a 12-story, 67,128 square foot 
(SF) mixed use property with ground floor retail and office space above. 
Known as the Scribner Building, the property includes a six-story, 
12,904 SF building with frontage along East 48th Street. 
As of December 2014, occupancy declined to 46% from 52% 
at securitization. The borrower intends to reposition the ground 
floor retail space between both buildings after which Sephora is expected 
to expand and occupy the entire ground floor retail space. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 118% and 0.71X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the Refinery Hotel Loan ($78.6 
million -- 5.4% of the pool), which 
is secured by a 197-room boutique hotel located near Bryant Park 
in Midtown Manhattan. Occupancy was 91% as of December 2014 
compared to 86% at securitization. Revenue per available 
room was $330 for 2014. The loan amortizes on a 25 year 
schedule. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 101% and 1.09X, 
respectively, compared to 104% and 1.07X, at 
securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.

                    Global Credit Research - 04 Aug 2014
                







Approximately $902 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, August 04, 2014 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned definitive ratings to six classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by COMM 2014-UBS4 Mortgage Trust, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.




Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-5, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 91 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 124 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which 
is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's 
assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's LTV ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.44X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.93X is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 113.2% is higher than the 
2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%. 





Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level 
diversity when selecting a ratings approach.




With respect to loan level diversity, the pool's loan level 
(includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index 
is 29.9. The transaction's loan level diversity is 
at the higher end of the band of Herfindahl scores found in most multi-borrower 
transactions issued since 2009. With respect to property level 
diversity, the pool's property level Herfindahl Index is 43.7. 
The transaction's property diversity profile is higher than the 
indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions issued since 
2009. 




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.13, which is lower than 
the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions since 
2009. 




This deal has a super-senior Aaa class with 30% credit enhancement. 
Although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate 
holders provides additional protection against pool loss, the super-senior 
structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. The transaction was structured with additional subordination 
at class A-M to mitigate the potential increased severity to class 
A-M.




The principal methodology used in this rating was " Moody's Approach to 
Rating U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 
2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v2.64 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 3%, 
12%, and 19%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated senior Aaa class would be Aaa, Aaa, 
Aa1 respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended to measure 
how the rating of the security might migrate over time; rather they 
are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial 
rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating 
process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has not aged. 
Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario 
from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. Qualitative 
factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer 
at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently 
verified by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement 
of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, 
inducement or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities 
or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection 
with any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF375775.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

MOODY’S DEFINES CREDIT RISK AS THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY MAY NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL, FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE AND ANY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CREDIT RATINGS DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER RISK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET VALUE RISK, OR PRICE VOLATILITY.

NEITHER CREDIT RATINGS NOR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS COMMENT ON THE SUITABILITY OF AN INVESTMENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. MOODY’S ISSUES ITS CREDIT RATINGS AND PUBLISHES MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INVESTOR WILL, WITH DUE CARE, MAKE ITS OWN STUDY AND EVALUATION OF EACH SECURITY THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASE, HOLDING, OR SALE. MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY RETAIL INVESTORS AND IT WOULD BE RECKLESS AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO USE MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS OR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to COMM 2014-UBS4 Mortgage Trust Commercial 
      Pass-Through Certificates
    





July 31, 2014 01:55 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation's COMM 2014-UBS4 
      Mortgage Trust Commercial Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      --$53,395,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$143,249,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,295,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,200,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$353,672,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$995,213,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,402,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,973,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$206,128,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,753,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not expect to rate the $112,726,000 interest-only class X-B 
      certificates, the $22,545,000 interest-only class X-C certificates, 
      $74,077,798 interest-only class X-D certificates, the $83,740,000 class 
      D, the $22,545,000 class E, the $25,766,000 class F, or $48,311,798 
      class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 91 loans secured by 124 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.288 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., German American Capital Corporation, 
      Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., The Bancorp Bank, KeyBank 
      National Association, and Pillar Funding LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 70.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 81.8%, and asset summary reviews on 87.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: This transaction has leverage metrics that are 
      worse than recently analyzed transactions, with a Fitch stressed debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.13x and a Fitch stressed loan to 
      value (LTV) of 108.9%. The average first-half 2014 Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.19x and 105.6%, respectively. The average 2013 Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.29x and 101.6%, respectively.
    

      Lower Loan Concentration: Loan concentration is lower than that of other 
      recent transactions. The largest loan represents 9.9% of the pool, and 
      the top 10 loans represent 47.1%. The average top 10 concentrations for 
      first-half 2014 and 2013 conduit transactions were 52.5% and 54.5%, 
      respectively.
    

      Limited Amortization: 20.7% of the pool is full-term interest-only, and 
      38.9% of the pool is partial-term interest-only. The remainder of the 
      pool (48 loans, 40.4%) consists of amortizing balloon loans with loan 
      terms of five to 12.5 years. Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, 
      the pool will have paid down 12.1%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9% below the most 
      recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent NOI 
      was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-UBS4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in 
      which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 80-82.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National 
      Association, rated 'CSS1'.

DBRS Confirms Ratings on COMM 2014-UBS4 Mortgage Trust


June 2, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings on the following classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-UBS4 issued by COMM 2014-UBS4 Mortgage Trust:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-5 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class B at AA (sf)
-- Class X-B at A (high) (sf)
-- Class C at A (sf)
-- Class PEZ at A (sf) 
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf)
-- Class X-C at BB (high) (sf)
-- Class E at BB (sf)
-- Class X-D at B (high) (sf)
-- Class F at B (sf)

All trends are Stable. The Class PEZ certificates are exchangeable for the Class A-M, Class B and Class C certificates (and vice versa).

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction, which has experienced a collateral reduction of 2.5% as a result of scheduled loan amortization since closing. At issuance, the collateral consisted of 91 fixed-rate loans secured by 124 commercial and multifamily properties. As of the May 2017 remittance, all 91 loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1,258.9 million. The pool is concentrated by market type and loan size as properties located in urban markets represent 24.2% of the pool balance and the top ten loans make up 47.4% of the pool balance. Based on the most recent reporting for the individual loans, the top 15 loans continue to exhibit stable performance with a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.83 times (x) and WA net cash flow growth of 22% compared with DBRS�s respective figures at issuance. 

As of the May 2017 remittance, there are five loans on the servicer�s watchlist and two loans in special servicing, representing 11.6% and 0.5% of the current pool balance, respectively. The largest loan on the watchlist, 597 Fifth Avenue (Prospectus ID#2; 8.3% of the pool) is secured by two Class B mixed-use retail and office properties in Midtown Manhattan. The loan was added to the watchlist because the largest tenant, Sephora, which previously occupied retail space the subject and made up 80.5% of revenues for the property, vacated its space in March 2017. The servicer reported a tentative lease with Lululemon, however, which was anticipated to commence on June 1, 2017, and run through July 31, 2018. In the meantime, the borrower plans to fund any debt service shortfalls with additional equity. 

The two loans in special servicing are Stanley Apartments (Prospectus ID#75; 0.27% of the pool) and Microtel Inn & Suites (Prospectus ID#80; 0.25% of the pool balance), which transferred in February 2016 and January 2016, respectively. Stanley Apartments has experienced decreased revenues because of its location within the Bakken Oil Fields. Stanley Apartments has also had a loan modification to full interest-only and will be transferred back to the master servicer after a three-month monitoring period. The special servicer foreclosed on Microtel Inn & Suites and a keeper has been engaged. DBRS anticipates that the trust will experience a loss with the resolution of this loan; however, it is expected to be contained within the non-rated class. 

The rating assigned to Class C materially deviates from the higher rating implied by the quantitative results. The deviation is warranted because sustainability of loan trends has not yet been demonstrated. 

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please register or log into at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-UBS4 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





July 16, 2014 11:48 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-UBS4 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$53,395,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$143,249,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,295,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,200,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$353,672,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$995,213,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,402,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,973,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$206,128,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,753,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 16, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $112,726,000 
      interest-only class X-B certificates, the $22,545,000 interest-only 
      class X-C certificates, $74,077,798 interest-only class X-D 
      certificates, the $83,740,000 class D, the $22,545,000 class E, the 
      $25,766,000 class F, or $48,311,798 class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 91 loans secured by 124 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.288 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., German American Capital Corporation, 
      Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., The Bancorp Bank, KeyBank 
      National Association, and Pillar Funding LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 70.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 81.8%, and asset summary reviews on 87.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: This transaction has leverage metrics that are 
      worse than recently analyzed transactions, with a Fitch stressed DSCR of 
      1.13x and a Fitch stressed LTV of 108.9%. The average first-half 2014 
      Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.19x and 105.6%, respectively. The average 2013 
      Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.29x and 101.6%, respectively.
    

      Lower Loan Concentration: Loan concentration is lower than that of other 
      recent transactions. The largest loan represents 9.9% of the pool, and 
      the top 10 loans represent 47.1%. The average top 10 concentrations for 
      first-half 2014 and 2013 conduit transactions were 52.5% and 54.5%, 
      respectively.
    

      Limited Amortization: 20.7% of the pool is full-term interest-only, and 
      38.9% of the pool is partial-term interest-only. The remainder of the 
      pool (48 loans, 40.4%) consists of amortizing balloon loans with loan 
      terms of five to 12.5 years. Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, 
      the pool will have paid down 12.1%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.0% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-UBS4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in 
      which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 80-82.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National 
      Association, rated 'CSS1'.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
