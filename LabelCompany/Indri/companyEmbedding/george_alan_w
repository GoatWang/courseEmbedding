Services
Almost every office supply company will have the same information as we could list here, So we have decided to list just the ones we think make us different. 
			Information regarding order minimums, delivery, returns and more can 
			be found on our "FAQ" link above.
Customer Service
			GWA currently utilizes 13 full time customer service representatives. 
			Five of whom work primarily with federal government customers. 
			Representatives are trained to ensure that our customers are taken care of in a prompt and professional manner.
			
			Our team approach assures that every order will flow smoothly through our system. 
			The experience of our federal team is second to none. 
			Averaging 22 years of industry know how, they get the job done.
			Our government customer service lines are open daily from 7:00am to 5:00pm EST. 
			OUR ACD phone system allows our customers to dial a CSR directly or remain in a queue for the first available live person. 
			CSR's work closely with members of the GoverNet distribution network providing a local touch to our national distribution.
Complete billing on credit cards
			Orders placed on government procurement cards or other credit cards have the option of being billed only when the order has been completely 
			delivered, regardless of how many deliveries were made.
			 This makes for an easier reconciliation of credit card statements for our customers, since they will not recieve a seperate invoice for every delivery made regarding the original order.
			










 

One order - One bill - No waiting for all items to arrive..
Products arrive faster.
Credit card statements from the financial institution are 
				easier to settle.

Frequently Asked Questions
We hope we can answer all your questions here. If your question 
			is is not answered here please call or email us for a prompt reply.
Q: How long does it take to get 
			delivery?
			A: George Allen delivers all office 
			supply orders received by 4 PM the next business day via our own 
			trucks and professional, courteous drivers. Our delivery area is the 
			Washington Metropolitan Area and all normal deliveries are free. We 
			define this area as within the Capital beltway and slightly outside 
			of it. We ship same day via courier but will add the courier charge 
			to the order. Outside this area we ship UPS the next day and you can 
			expect the order to take 1 day for every 150 miles away from 
			Washington (usually within 48 -72 hrs).

			In most major cities in the United States we can forward your order 
			to a distribution center and provide next day delivery as if the 
			delivery point was within our own. To provide this service on an 
			ongoing basis we need to set this up ahead of time.

If you wish to confirm whether 
			you are in our truck delivery area for next day service just call 
			301-614-9500 and ask for customer service.

			We can ship overseas and will add the shipping costs to the total of 
			the order.
Q: What is the minimum order?
			A: While we would love to have everyone order 
			at least $50.00 each time they call or place an order we realize 
			that it's not our customers' business to order office supplies. 
			People sometimes forget to order something or are told at the last 
			minute that they are out of something they must have. 

			Since we are looking for long term relationships with our customers 
			we impose no minimums and no small order charges for items in stock 
			or in our full line catalogs. We know that are customers don't want 
			to process paperwork for a small order either so when they do it is 
			usually because they have to.
NOTE: 
			If the item you need is only available from the manufacturer then it 
			is likely that the manufacturer will have a minimum order size.
Q: What is your return policy??
			A: GWA will allow the government to return items contained in the 
			original packaging and sellable condition up to 30 days from the 
			date the item was delivered. GWA will provide a full refund, less 
			any applicable restocking fee for such item within 30 days of 
			receipt of the returned item. Returned items will not be charged a 
			restocking fee unless said item is a specialty item and the ordering 
			party received written notice of a potential restocking fee prior to 
			placing the item on order.
