The Committee of Seventy »
The century-old Committee of Seventy champions better government to help Philadelphia grow and prosper. Leading by example, the non-partisan organization aims to change the guarded nature of policy and politics debates in Philadelphia.

The Committee of Seventy has been called a “government watchdog,” “the elections people” and a “think tank.” In fact, we are all of these and much more.

Seventy is a not-for-profit group that works for effective, efficient government to benefit all citizens and create a better future for our region. Headed by many of the region’s most respected business, legal and civic leaders, Seventy holds one goal highest – to use our voice and our influence to provoke real change.

We are fiercely non-partisan and never endorse candidates. Whether we are working quietly behind the scenes or making noise, Seventy fights for better government, fair elections and an honest political culture. We raise public awareness about complex issues in language that is meaningful to non-experts, taking the lead on tough issues or joining forces with other concerned organizations.

The Committee of Seventy is fighting every day to make Philadelphia a better place to live, work, and do business.

The best measure of Seventy’s success is not just government reform for its own sake, but fundamental change that will attract more residents and jobs to the Philadelphia region.
