The Baute Laceador Progressivo
A natural hair relaxer
Ideal for :

Curly Virgin hair:  Girls and youngsters that want to avoid quemical relaxers
Processed hair : Extremely damaged hair to prolong periods between hair relaxing processes.
Chemically sensitive scalps.

The Baute Laceador Progressivo can be applied every time you wash your head. Remember this hair relaxer is a deep treatment that you have to use for 10 minutes in a hair dryer with a plastic
hair cap on your head, and then you have to use plenty of water to take out all hair relaxer, and then use the conditioner .
This product is perfect for hair relaxing processes or for dry hair because it moisturizes your hair.
These would be the steps to follow:

You will wash the head using shampoo (preferably Baute Shampoo )
Then you apply the Baute Laciador Progressivo for 10 minutes with a plastic hair cap on the top of your head. In this step you can also put in the dryer for 5 minutes, but with a plastic hair cap on your head.Note : DO NOT use much hair relaxer because it is highly concentrated, always wear what your hair needs .
Then you have to use plenty of water to take out all hair relaxer.
Uses a rinse or conditioner (preferably Baute Conditioner)
Comb you hair as you want (user hair rollers, blower it or as desired)

This process you can do it weekly and you will notice how your hair will be hydrated, giving life and shine to your hair, and you will see the change in your hair from the first time you use it.

Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple or different identities, forms, or email addresses or any other methods will void all of that participant’s entries, and that participant may be disqualified at Sponsor’s discretion.  In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the registered player.  The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.  Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder or forfeit the prize.  Entries specifying an invalid, non-working, or inactive email address will be disqualified and ineligible to win.  Sponsor and Sponsor’s agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, representatives, or service providers may use entrants’ email address submitted with entry for purposes of prize notification, prize fulfillment, and/or future marketing by Sponsor.  You may remove your email address from future email marketing promotions by following the instructions on any email marketing promotion.  Information collected from entrants is subject to the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy, which may be found at http://www.josbank.com/privacy-policy. 

4.  PRIZE DRAWINGS:  A random drawing will be held on or about the first day of each month from among all eligible entries received in the previous month.  Sponsor’s decisions are final and legally binding on all matters relating to the Sweepstakes.

Upon verification of winner’s eligibility by Sponsor, Prize will be sent to winner’s home address.  Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure to abide by these Official Rules, failure to respond within seven (7) days after the first attempt to contact the potential winner or return of the prize notification or prize as undeliverable may result in disqualification and the naming of an alternate potential winner. Up to 3 alternate drawings will be held, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded. No compensation will be given upon prize forfeiture for any reason.  Unaccepted prizes may not be awarded within sole discretion of Sponsor.  Sponsor is not responsible for any change of mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number of entrants.
