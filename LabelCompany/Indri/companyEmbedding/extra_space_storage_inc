Most common questions







What size of storage unit do I need?

							Estimate how many boxes and non-packed items—including furniture and appliances—you plan to store. Then use our helpful Unit Size Guide to determine which storage option is right for you!
                            
More about selecting a unit size




What type of storage unit do I need?

							Many factors determine the correct storage solution: Do you want the convenience of a ground floor unit? Do your belongings need climate control? What about vehicle storage? We have online resources to help you explore these options to find your ideal storage unit.
                            
More about storage unit options




How long of a lease am I required to sign?

							Our storage units are rented on a month-to-month basis. Your rental with us can be long or short – depending on your needs.
						


Do I need to provide my own lock?

							You can purchase a new lock at your local Extra Space Storage facility. We offer a variety of sizes and types of locks and recommend purchasing a disc lock to ensure the highest level of security.
						


What security measures do you take to protect my stuff?

							Extra Space Storage takes great pride in protecting your belongings and strives to provide state-of-the-art security. We feature electronic gates with coded access, monitored video surveillance, fenced and well-lit facilities, individual door alarms and personal locks available for purchase. These features vary by location so contact the Store Manager for details about a specific location.
						


What pest control and cleanliness measures do you take?

							Every building at Extra Space Storage is treated for pests and rodents each month by Truly Nolen, dedicated pest control experts since 1938.
						


Do you provide moving carts or dollies?

							Nearly all Extra Space Storage facilities that have inside units with access through a hallway will maintain an inventory of “push carts” that may be used free of charge. If you find yourself renting an inside storage unit and need a push cart to transport your belongings, please let the Store Manager know and they will be happy to assist you.
						


Can I buy boxes and other packing products from EXR?

							All Extra Space Storage facilities offer a wide variety of boxes and packing supplies that are available for purchase. We also have compiled a list of packing and storage tips to help you as you prepare to store your valuables.
						


Do you provide a free moving truck or discount on truck rental?

							We have a partnership with Budget Truck who specializes in moving trucks. They offer a variety of trucks and vans for your moving needs. To reserve a truck and save up to 20%, call 1-800-566-8422 and mention code 56000160779 or visit budgettruck.com/extraspace.
						


Am I required to purchase insurance for my storage unit?

Renting a storage unit







What does on site manager mean?

							"On-site" manager means that an employee, usually the Store Manager, has an apartment on-site as part of the facility. An on-site manager increases the security of the facility since there is someone there during non-business hours.
						


What is climate control?

							Storage units with climate control maintain a consistent environment of 55˚F-85˚F in order to protect items that may be damaged in extreme temperatures.
                            
Find out if you need climate control




What is a drive-up unit?

							Think of a drive-up unit as an extra garage. These units are on the ground floor and have an exterior entrance which allows for direct access to and from your vehicle.
                            
More about self storage basics




What is a roll-up door?

							Roll-up doors are the most common door in self-storage. They are accessed by sliding a latch and lifting the door upward, similar to the motion of a garage door. Roll-up doors allow you to maximize the usage of your space.
						


Difference between indoor and outdoor unit?

							An outdoor unit is most often a drive-up unit, located on the first floor of a facility, that gives you the ability to load your belongings directly from a vehicle or truck.

Storage Lease







How far in advance can I book a reservation?

							We give you the flexibility to book a reservation up to 14 days in advance to help you plan ahead.
						


How long of a lease am I required to sign?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis which allows customers flexibility to rent for whatever time period is needed. Customers with long term needs may prepay on a yearly basis (12 months) and get a 13th month free.
						


What documentation is needed to rent?

							You will need to bring a government issued ID to complete your storage unit rental. The easiest and most convenient method to pay your monthly storage unit fee is through easy pay. You will need a credit card to take advantage of this service.
						


What are my payment options/terms?

							Extra Space Storage strives to make your storage experience as convenient as possible, including paying your bill. Monthly payment can be made in-store, online, by phone (888-STORAGE), or by mailing us a check. In-store payments can be made with cash, check or credit card. We can help you set up automatically withdrawn payments each month from your credit card or checking account. Payments can be made online in the "My Account" section here at extraspace.com.
						


Do you offer the convenience of long-term lease?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis which allows customers flexibility to rent for whatever time period is needed. Customers with long-term needs may prepay on a yearly basis (12 months) and get a 13th month free.
						


What are the lease terms?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis. Your rental with us can be long or short – depending on your needs. Monthly rent is due each month on the anniversary of your rental start date. For your convenience we offer many payment options including the option to pre-pay for up to twelve months of rent. When you are ready to vacate we require two days verbal OR 15 days written notice before vacating. If you advise the rental office of your intention to vacate before paying your final month, we will prorate your last month of rent so you pay only for what you use.
						


Is my price guaranteed for as long as I rent?

							Extra Space Storage works hard to provide a value to our customers through competitive pricing and by maintaining clean, safe, and secure facilities with the best customer service in the self-storage industry. Please keep in mind that your original monthly rate is not guaranteed for the life of your rental with Extra Space Storage. From time to time, we find it necessary to make adjustments to our customers’ rental rates in order to keep up with the rising costs associated with providing top-notch service and a clean, secure facility.
						


What do I need to have on move-in day?

							If you’ve decided to insure your items outside of the insurance policies offered by Extra Space Storage, you will need to have a copy of your insurance policy, declaration or the like when you move-in. You are also required to provide your own lock for your storage unit. If you forget to bring a lock or need items such as boxes, packing tape, or move-in kits on move-in day, all of those and more are available for purchase at each of our storage facilities.
						


Can I change to a different size after I've already moved in?

							If the unit size you want is available at your facility, then yes you can move into another unit. Your local facility manager will be able to assist you in that transition.
						


What if I'm late making a payment?

							Your monthly rent is due on the same day each month (the anniversary date of the rental). Extra Space Storage provides a five day grace period before charging a late fee on the 6th day past a payment due date. The late fee assessed varies by state according to local self-storage law; the grace period for a past-due payment can also vary by state. For further details, please refer to your lease or contact your storage facility. Late fees cannot be waived and the full balance must be paid immediately to avoid foreclosure. No partial payments are accepted. Please also note that until your account is paid in full, access to your unit may be denied, your gate code access is removed and your unit will be over-locked. The late fees assessed vary according to state laws.
						


How long after my account is deliquent will stuff go to auction?

							The length of time for a past-due account to be placed in auction varies by state law. We recommend that you contact the Store Manager to discuss your account as soon as possible if your payment is late. Extra Space Storage will provide written notice to your email address or physical address listed on your account, again depending on state law. Additionally, Store Managers frequently try to contact any customer in default by phone prior to an auction process. As a customer, it is your responsibility to make sure we have accurate, up-to-date contact information associated with your account, and to pay your bill on time.
						


What happens if my belongings go to auction?

							Once the unit is sold the proceeds are applied to your outstanding balance. If the proceeds are higher than the amount due, a check for the difference will be sent to the original person leasing the storage unit. If the proceeds are lower than the outstanding balance the account will be sent to collections.

Existing Customer Questions







How can I change my email options?

							To receive email from us just make sure your account has your email associated with it. You can do this online or through personnel at your storage facility. To stop receiving email there is an option at the bottom of every email you receive from us allowing you to "opt-out" of emails.

What do I do if I have difficulties signing into the website?


								First, make sure you have selected the correct state and facility where your rental unit is located. The state and facility you select must match your email and password on file to sign in. 
							

								Another possibility is that your computer may not be accepting cookies. Make sure that your browser allows cookies (i.e., that cookies are turned on). 
							

								Sometimes, the login page will not display correctly if your browser isn't set for Western text encoding. In most browsers, you can manually change the text encoding style by clicking on the "View" menu and selecting "Encoding" or "Text Encoding", followed by "Default" or "Automatic". If this doesn't solve the problem, select either "UTF-8" or Western text encoding. 
							

								A final suggestion is to upgrade your browser to the latest version. If none of these changes help you login to the website, please contact us at customerhelp@extraspace.com or by calling 888-609-8483.
							



Why can't I access My Account outside of US?

							Due to security concerns, we have restricted our website from some countries outside the US. We apologize for this inconvenience. We do offer payment over the phone by calling (877) 842-8740 or you can set up easy pay. Your Store Manager can also help you set up easy pay.
						


How do I update my information listed on My Account?

Very responsive, accommodating and helpful






It was the best experience with a storage company. We had to change the size we needed few times, and they were very patient and helpful.

This facility is good for study abroad storage






The facility is nice and clean and has ample room in its storage spaces. I rented one for study abroad, and the smallest unit fit my couch, my bike, and all my clothes. Good price for great quality!

I really loved this place. I needed to store my stuff for two weeks as I moved, and it was a good experience.

The business was very accommodating: the staff was very friendly, attentive, and helpful, and there are plenty of carts to help move your stuff. I also felt that my belongings were very safe, secured behind a code-access gate and under the watch of a number of security cameras. Though there are only three designated parking spots, you are welcome to park pretty much anywhere inside the gated area that's not in someone else's way.

There were only a couple minor drawbacks. The pricing was fine for me as it was 'First Month Free*' (plus a $20 administrative fee and a $13 lock), but it seemed expensive compared to some of the other places I considered after that first month. Other than that, my only other complaint was that the hours (7a-7p) were a bit restrictive.

Overall, I really enjoyed doing business with Extra Space Storage. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!







This is a very secure unit, gated with lots of cameras. My unit is on the inside high seems to be built like a bunker. If a nuclear bomb was to hit, this is where I would run to. The customer service is top notch, they are very informative, knowledgable and probably the best customer service I've had in a while. Jovita was the one that helped us and she goes above and beyond to make sure are needs were met. I highly recommend this place. Oh before I forget this place had the best prices around.







Jovita gave me excellent service at Extra Space storage at 999 E Bayshore, Palo Alto. She showed me the unit and how to access the gate and inner door, showed me where the light switches are (VERY IMPORTANT!!!) and kindly took her time to add access for my son and to explain the lease agreement. I highly recommend Extra Space, and be sure to ask for Jovita!







Great overall experience. Desiree (I believe that's her name) was very pleasant and professional from beginning to end. The facility was very well maintained and felt secure, plus, the actual storage unit was very clean. I rented for only one month, so can't reference the reviews from others who mention issues with longer term leases.







Desiree was amazing. This was one of the best experiences ive had at almost any commercial setting! Highly recommended.







Been renting and I always get Good customer service,clean and great price  I highly recommend renting at extra space east palo alto







So I'm a dummy and I lost the key to the lock on my storage room, but luckily, Jovita is a master lock terminator. She dropped what she was doing and immediately helped us. Very grateful and I would recommend this location to anyone looking for quality service and friendly faces!







Desiree rented me a unit this morning .she was helpful and it went really fast.i originally. Was supposed to rent a unit down on eastbayshore at public storage but no one was in the office when i arrived with all my belongings.so i drove down the way a little .pulled into extra space.the rest is history







Desiree is great!  I just started here, but she's been very helpful and they really prioritize cleanliness and security.  Great find.







This is a well-managed storage facility and very clean. I would recommend it highly to anyone. We have been using a locker for six years. Before that, we used Public Storage in Mountain View and the place kept having break-ins and the hallways are dirty. Advice, try Extra Space storage.







The place is clean and very friendly staff I will always continue to use extra Space Storage in East Palo Alto the girls there are amazing







I have been pretty happy with this company as a whole, so the two star rating is really over pricing.  The MAJOR problem that  have (and the reason why this is rated only 2 starts) is that they punish long term customers.  Prices rise the LONGER you stay and that makes no sense.  You get a great deal at Extra Space Storage if you stay for a month (practically FREE) or two (great rates) but after the 6 month mark prices rise and then do so at 12 months etc etc.  To be fair, this is in the fine print, but had it been something clear that I had noticed when I signed it up it would have deterred me. 

The staff here is REALLY nice however.  They remember you and are always helpful.  The pricing issue is not their fault and they really deserve 5 stars.  

The only other complaint here is that the doors at the end of the complex do not stay open when you need to bring items in from outside.  The magnet has been broken since I moved stuff in and it is quite annoying.







I almost rented here.  I got as far as going to the office, setting up a price, seeing the facility and putting out my credit card and reading the contract.   What deterred me was the fact that their rates are designed to punish long term customers with no way to lock it in.   Pretty silly to me.  After 5 month, the rates increase and they only notify you by traditional mail.  No email, no nothing.   This doesn't work for me.    It was too much hassle.  Plus they have all those random fees - set up fee, insurance.    I ended up going with a much better service provider that charged none of those fees, with no rate increases, and always simple flat pricing.







I cannot say enough great things about the staff and the facility.  From the moment I walked through the door, I was treated like a friend with kind and personable service.  The facility itself is very clean and very well kept.  I am very comfortable leaving my belongings there.  They have far exceeded my expectations and continue to do so.  I highly recommend this location!!







Like others have reviewed, the main drawback here is the constantly rising prices.  While positioned as "we find it necessary to make an adjustment to your rental rate in order to keep up with the rising costs associated with providing top-notch service and a clean, secure facility" in their rate increase notice, it's all about supply and demand and a worker there told me as much.  If they have a lot of demand they will raise the prices on everyone to help them squeeze as much profit as they can. 

A really frustrating experience and I would not recommend them.







Well, I stored in this place for 2 months. First month was free, although they add some insurance + admin processing fee. It was $29. Next month was $55. A couple of points they should have mentioned were that insurance is added every month for $9 and that the first month is not *really* free.

Anyway, it looks like some of the long-term storage users had some problems, but for short-term, I think this place is a good bet. I would suggest calling this place to get a good idea of how pricey it is for the amount of time you would like to store. The staff are really friendly as well (They called me before the rent was due so that I could avoid a late fee too).

Overall good experience.

A really frustrating experience and I would not recommend them.

Well, I stored in this place for 2 months. First month was free, although they add some insurance + admin processing fee. It was $29. Next month was $55. A couple of points they should have mentioned were that insurance is added every month for $9 and that the first month is not *really* free.Anyway, it looks like some of the long-term storage users had some problems, but for short-term, I think this place is a good bet. I would suggest calling this place to get a good idea of how pricey it is for the amount of time you would like to store. The staff are really friendly as well (They called me before the rent was due so that I could avoid a late fee too).Overall good experience.

Very responsive, accommodating and helpful






It was the best experience with a storage company. We had to change the size we needed few times, and they were very patient and helpful.

The facility is nice and clean and has ample room in its storage spaces. I rented one for study abroad, and the smallest unit fit my couch, my bike, and all my clothes. Good price for great quality!

AWESOME place! NICE employee's & GREAT service!






I would recommend this location to anyone who is looking for service &amp; a business who strives to meet your needs! The woman that helped us was sincere, very friendly &amp; covered everything we were in need of! I was in a last minute need for a storage unit, from being out of the area and she was absolutely a joy to talk to. The facility is very clean &amp; easy to access. Thank you for providing a pleasant experience!

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.

10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

The faclity in Santa Clara Ca is very nice. It has easy access and is very clean. The facility in Las Vegas on Las Vegas Blvd. Is quite the opposite. The unit where our storage is housed smells like urine. This is due to the homeless population that seem to have taken up residence in some of the units. I'm a little concerned about security there. So far nothing has happened . Hopefully nothing does. Overall I like Extra Space Storage and will continue to do business with them. Hopefully this will help clean up Vegas?

BOB He was so sweet and funny ever since I walked in through the door. Showed me the ropes to the facility, made renting the truck super easy and non stressful. Moving is a pain in the butt, so things are crazy plus bay area traffic on a Friday! Not to mention Taylor Swift show was that weekend too! BOB and DAVID got me and my group in and out before all the chaos started. BOB also made me SMILE :D he always made sure I was OK and had everything I need for the MOVE IN.

I like to Say that the people at Extra Space Storage have been so kind and understanding. I had to move and put my stuff in storage and this was a hard thing for me to do, since I had my place for so long, So doing this i appreciated the empathy that their staff has for people who are moving and not finding a place and the end result is you need to put your belongings into storage, and it is no fun... my pictures my clothes my things are packed away, but Ive gone to the facility to pickup something or put something else away and the facility is always clean and the staff are friendly. I also am going thru a tuff time since I got injured at work on January 11th 2015 and have been on workmans comp to this date still, and some months my check isn't here on the first and when Extra Space Storage calls they are understanding and not yelling or threatening which is a blessing, cause I'm going thru a lot with my hand and wrist surgery and not having feelings in my right hand, to assure them I will pay as soon as I get my check and I do, its nice to know that they understand, I'm usually only maybe a few days late not like 15 or 30. I know my responsibility to them is important but knowing that they are compassionate to my feelings and knowing that I'm doing the best I can and that my personal belongings are in their storage unit, they know Im going to pay. Its just nice to talk with someone who understands that I'm storing my stuff cause I haven't found a place yet. But Im still looking but being under Dr. care is tuff.

Thank you for your professionalism
compassion and empathy your storage facility is very important to me its where my life is on hold.

Thanks again

Renting a space was quick and easy. The location was ideal since I was moving out of a warehouse and needed extra space to store items that couldn't fit elsewhere.

They also have when available - outside units which means you have 24/7 access to your stuff. Manage lives on site so your stuff is safely guarded by watchful owner! :-)

Overall I would recommend this location if you are in need of a storage. They also provide free truck to help with the move-in process.

I must say thanks to David and Kacie as well for making the whole transition so smooth for me. Kacie is knowledgeable & very friendly employee, for a novice user like me she made me to understand all legalities very easily.
The whole paper work was pretty fast & everything was ready which includes space storage room as well.
The storage location is very strategic & safe.
So overall it is a good experience.







Gave 2 stars only because the lady in the office was real nice. I was very happy with them until i accidetally stayed 7 mintes past 10 in an effort to move out of there here  comes the main guy a death metal cherokee indian with a 3 foot pony tale but what a little p#### all he needed to do was say hey man its 1007 time for my bong hit or what ever but hes threating to call the poice i didnt understand at first but now i do hes just a nerd in a big body that should have never been given authority over anyone but hey for 11.50 at least i left







I rented a 5x5 closet size storage space and at first it was a decent deal.  Then they started to raise rate on me.  In the end it got all the way to $100/month.  No more for me!   I will never rent a space here again, their marketing / business practice is deceiving.







Been a renter for 3 years and this will be my last month. Here is the reason why.

Pros:
Place is clean, well lit. I have the 10x15 which is the biggest size and it was kinda small for me. I see some people rent super small spaces that looks like a small closet than anything.
It has a light inside your own room which works well in the evenings where u dont have to look for stuff in the dark. 

Cons:
Raising Rent- Signed up at 230/month then 2 months later raised it to 243 and one year later raised it to 260. I just looked at the Public Storage in my area and they are renting the same space out for 170. I will be moving there and upgrading to the 10x20 for 220/month.

Trash - There are two bins that are locked. Im not even trying to dump trash but sometimes people have trash (that fits in their hands) they need to throw away and when I asked the workers there they said no, only for office use.... GRRRRR

Location... only one way from a busy interchange.....


I asked if they can reduce my rent because I ve been a long time paying customer, but they said no. Only way is someone else opens up so they can give me the cheaper rate They DEFINITELY do not care about their loyal customers.







My parents had their stuff stored here for about 7 years, and then last year due to my dad's health problems, I had to transfer over the lease to my name since my dad wasn't able to pay for it anymore. They were very helpful and understanding through that process (especially since my dad had missed a month payment), and the process to switch over was painless. Everything is electronic, so it was nice not to have to sign tons of paperwork. There were also able to grandfather over the cheaper insurance rate my dad was paying to me. I was paying total $251 a month with insurance ($9).  I'm not sure how often the rate increased on my dad, but I'm aware there had been some increases throughout the 7 years, but I can only speak for the time during which I had the lease. 

We had an indoor 10X15 unit on the second floor. My building had two elevators that were conveniently located (and better than lifts at other places), with plenty of flatbed dollys available, and hallways are well lit. They have tons of cameras everywhere, with motion detection technology, so everything seems very secure at least for the indoor units. Also, they have lighting INSIDE your storage unit, which I know some places do not have.

After a year, it finally made more sense to move the stuff down to where I live now in San Diego (and also cheaper), so I ended up transferring it to another Extra Space Storage down here. Again, they were quick and efficient with the move out, and they even were able to take care of the San Diego paperwork from their office.  Thought I'm paying $100 less for my unit in San Diego for the same size unit, I can see the differences in facilities (lighting, elevator, equipment), so there may be some justification in the price difference (plus Silicon Valley is just an expensive place as is).

What was cool is that they staff knew who you were, even thought I would only pop in maybe once every 6 months to a year (me or my dad). There was some damage to the drywall of our unit, because of something that happened in the unit next door, and they were cool about it, and the manager remembered that my dad had reported it a while back and said it wasn't  a problem. 

Overall, it is an above average facility with excellent staff.







I had a great experience here. My SO found them somehow on the interwebs and I went to set it all up. David (Manager) and Kacie were very very helpful and friendly. I also, by chance, met the CEO and another executive during my visit and they were very friendly to speak with as well.

Would I recommend them to others? Without hesitation.

The facilities:
It's very easy to get to off of 101 & Montague Expy. Access to most of the units is gated and personal code protected. The buildings are clean and well lit. Lots of cameras around as well. There are also lots of places to park while un/loading your treasures.

The staff:
On my visit everyone was very friendly and helpful. It was a great experience. The lease signing process was all handled digitally and they emailed me copies of the documents when we were finished. Very cool and modern.

The cost:
Yes, storage in the bay area is expensive. There's no way around that except to find a place farther away. That being said, for my required balance of cost and convenience of access, this location fit the bill. I searched several other major self-storage brand websites for comparable lockers and prices in my chosen area and these guys came in as the winners.







An extremely fast and pleasant experience getting a storage space on short notice. Kacie at the front desk was very nice and professional. She took her time and gave me a few good tips on using our space. There were only a couple small downsides that had nothing to do with the customer service. The elevators could be a little bigger, but more importantly they should have better sensors on the doors. The sensor only opens the door if it actually hits you! So our bodies and furniture got rammed a few times by the door. Also, the lack of lighting inside the unit is a severe oversight. Even with our own flashlights, it was hard to deal with.







I needed a storage unit just for the month (as I'm moving out of town and couldn't get it all in the truck) I went online and found them, and reserved online.  It's very clean and I've used a lot of self-storage places as I move a lot.The young lady in the office called to confirm a few days ahead.  When I showed up she told me there was a special on a unit on the ground floor near an entrance and the first month was free!  I was in and out in about 15 minutes!  She was fast, professional, and efficient!  I wish I could remember her name, but in the move it was so chaotic.  It was her anniversary though!!! :)    Thank you again for making a stressful day much less so!  I would recommend them 100%.







This self-storage was decent and clean. Prices did rise over time -it seemed rather rapidly.  I chose a new storage and moved today and I just wanted to give Bob a shout out for really being helpful and for doing all he could to help us with that which was most appreciated!  Thanks Bob!!







This storage facility is like most I've encountered: it has some issues as the other reviews have mentioned, but overall it's a solid choice if the area works for you (that 101 S off-ramp though....).

What really stood out to me was the service from David and Kacie. They've always been very friendly and helpful, working with me to get the best rates and answering any questions I have, etc. Usually basic stuff, but a lost art in the world of modern customer service. David did go above and beyond once in helping me move some heavier furniture and throw away some large trash (an office chair, etc.). 

Unfortunately, having your unit broken in to kind of overrides anything else I could say about this place. I was assured that the new facility was safe, with a single break-in once before a "while ago." There are a few scattered security cameras, but the outside units are not very well secured. 

I moved pretty much my entire life into an 8x10 to move down to LA to help my mother with an upcoming surgery. After being away for two months, I return to my unit to find out it had been broken into and ransacked, as had several other outside units. The burglars apparently ripped the lock mechanisms right off the shudders, negating them altogether. 

So, now I have to figure out what's gone, what's destroyed (they were obviously in a rush and tossed everything around quite a bit), and file a claim for a limited reimbursement (higher insurance protection costs more and more each month, and I opted for the basic choice given the reassurances I had that my belongings were protected).

I'm surprised none of the other victims have written Yelp reviews yet. I'd be curious to know the extent of total damage done.







Excellent staff, great location, clean units, variety of sizes. I've used ESS for residential and commercial storage, always pleased. David, Kacie and crew are helpful, knowledgeable, considerate. Pricing is straight forward, with frequent discounts / special rates available. Worth full price.







Kacie David and bob great people funny happy awesome help recommend to come rear spaces







Does anyone love needing to pay for extra storage in the Bay Area, when you remember living in places back east that have attic, basement, and garage? I don't! However, the staff is pleasant and helpful, and they made it clear that they wanted me to be happy with the space I chose.

Unlike other storage places I've used over the years, I have always been able to find a cart. Yes, there isn't a lot of parking, but people can be creative about where to park. Once, when I parked in a marked space in front of a garage-door type storage space and the people wanted to get into their space, everyone was very nice in the way they asked me to move.

Yes, the off-ramp merge from 101 is crazy-dangerous -- but I blame the state and the city for that, not Extra Space Storage. Be cautious!







Sign up was cake, checkout was cake. Did monthly automatic payments so everything was a breeze.







Mostly very good:
- Staff very friendly and helpful
- Clean
- Easy access to the unit

The *only* beef I have is that they did not mention the required insurance ($12 or 22 per month?) when I inquired on the phone. Even after asking if there were any hidden charges. Not a big deal, but it really should be mentioned so people can make informed decisions when deciding between facilities.







Just coming up on a month of using this storage spot. Kacie and David (the store managers) were reasonable, friendly, and helpful. Kacie showed me all of different storage units and answered all my questions. Today when I requested a short extension to the unit I had picked, they were willing to work with me and charge by the day. Overall good experience.







Best Storage place that I have found in the Bay Area. It's Affordable it's Clean, Secure and has The Best Staff.  And It's Open Until 10 p.m. Every Day!!







While the staff were quite friendly and helpful, I experienced the same 'rent rate increase' that others complained about.

In addition, my unit was on the 3rd floor and the roof leaked both incredible hunks of filth and rain. For  $100 per month, one would at least expect  not to have my things rained upon and covered with large hunks of filthy dust and dirt.

Don't be enticed by the low initial rental rate and be very wary of renting any unit where you have things which could be damaged by water or dirt.







As far as the facility itself goes, it is always clean, super convenient, and the employees seem friendly and helpful. If you're looking for something short term, I would recommend this place. However, I moved in to a 10x12 about a year and a half ago and my rate has now been raised twice. When I called and asked about the increases, I was informed this was a standard increase, one increase after 5 months and now I can expect to have my rate increased on a yearly basis. So, where $148 for my 10x12 was reasonable, the close to $200 I'm now paying is not. I will be relocating my belongings to a different storage facility with a more reasonable rate for long term storage.







Helped my mom rent a unit here for about 5 years. The place is always clean and secure. I've always had a very positive experience with any of the employees. Kacie was especially helpful during our move-out. She is friendly, helpful, and professional. The only reason that I do not give a full five stars is a reflection on the corp office, as they do not prorate partial months. I recommend this facility if you are looking for dependable, secure, clean storage options.

I must say thanks to David and Kacie as well for making the whole transition so smooth for me. Kacie is knowledgeable & very friendly employee, for a novice user like me she made me to understand all legalities very easily.The whole paper work was pretty fast & everything was ready which includes space storage room as well.The storage location is very strategic & safe.So overall it is a good experience.

I rented a 5x5 closet size storage space and at first it was a decent deal.  Then they started to raise rate on me.  In the end it got all the way to $100/month.  No more for me!   I will never rent a space here again, their marketing / business practice is deceiving.

Been a renter for 3 years and this will be my last month. Here is the reason why.Pros:Place is clean, well lit. I have the 10x15 which is the biggest size and it was kinda small for me. I see some people rent super small spaces that looks like a small closet than anything.It has a light inside your own room which works well in the evenings where u dont have to look for stuff in the dark. Cons:Raising Rent- Signed up at 230/month then 2 months later raised it to 243 and one year later raised it to 260. I just looked at the Public Storage in my area and they are renting the same space out for 170. I will be moving there and upgrading to the 10x20 for 220/month.Trash - There are two bins that are locked. Im not even trying to dump trash but sometimes people have trash (that fits in their hands) they need to throw away and when I asked the workers there they said no, only for office use.... GRRRRRLocation... only one way from a busy interchange.....I asked if they can reduce my rent because I ve been a long time paying customer, but they said no. Only way is someone else opens up so they can give me the cheaper rate They DEFINITELY do not care about their loyal customers.

My parents had their stuff stored here for about 7 years, and then last year due to my dad's health problems, I had to transfer over the lease to my name since my dad wasn't able to pay for it anymore. They were very helpful and understanding through that process (especially since my dad had missed a month payment), and the process to switch over was painless. Everything is electronic, so it was nice not to have to sign tons of paperwork. There were also able to grandfather over the cheaper insurance rate my dad was paying to me. I was paying total $251 a month with insurance ($9).  I'm not sure how often the rate increased on my dad, but I'm aware there had been some increases throughout the 7 years, but I can only speak for the time during which I had the lease. We had an indoor 10X15 unit on the second floor. My building had two elevators that were conveniently located (and better than lifts at other places), with plenty of flatbed dollys available, and hallways are well lit. They have tons of cameras everywhere, with motion detection technology, so everything seems very secure at least for the indoor units. Also, they have lighting INSIDE your storage unit, which I know some places do not have.After a year, it finally made more sense to move the stuff down to where I live now in San Diego (and also cheaper), so I ended up transferring it to another Extra Space Storage down here. Again, they were quick and efficient with the move out, and they even were able to take care of the San Diego paperwork from their office.  Thought I'm paying $100 less for my unit in San Diego for the same size unit, I can see the differences in facilities (lighting, elevator, equipment), so there may be some justification in the price difference (plus Silicon Valley is just an expensive place as is).What was cool is that they staff knew who you were, even thought I would only pop in maybe once every 6 months to a year (me or my dad). There was some damage to the drywall of our unit, because of something that happened in the unit next door, and they were cool about it, and the manager remembered that my dad had reported it a while back and said it wasn't  a problem. Overall, it is an above average facility with excellent staff.

I had a great experience here. My SO found them somehow on the interwebs and I went to set it all up. David (Manager) and Kacie were very very helpful and friendly. I also, by chance, met the CEO and another executive during my visit and they were very friendly to speak with as well.Would I recommend them to others? Without hesitation.The facilities:It's very easy to get to off of 101 & Montague Expy. Access to most of the units is gated and personal code protected. The buildings are clean and well lit. Lots of cameras around as well. There are also lots of places to park while un/loading your treasures.The staff:On my visit everyone was very friendly and helpful. It was a great experience. The lease signing process was all handled digitally and they emailed me copies of the documents when we were finished. Very cool and modern.The cost:Yes, storage in the bay area is expensive. There's no way around that except to find a place farther away. That being said, for my required balance of cost and convenience of access, this location fit the bill. I searched several other major self-storage brand websites for comparable lockers and prices in my chosen area and these guys came in as the winners.

An extremely fast and pleasant experience getting a storage space on short notice. Kacie at the front desk was very nice and professional. She took her time and gave me a few good tips on using our space. There were only a couple small downsides that had nothing to do with the customer service. The elevators could be a little bigger, but more importantly they should have better sensors on the doors. The sensor only opens the door if it actually hits you! So our bodies and furniture got rammed a few times by the door. Also, the lack of lighting inside the unit is a severe oversight. Even with our own flashlights, it was hard to deal with.

I needed a storage unit just for the month (as I'm moving out of town and couldn't get it all in the truck) I went online and found them, and reserved online.  It's very clean and I've used a lot of self-storage places as I move a lot.The young lady in the office called to confirm a few days ahead.  When I showed up she told me there was a special on a unit on the ground floor near an entrance and the first month was free!  I was in and out in about 15 minutes!  She was fast, professional, and efficient!  I wish I could remember her name, but in the move it was so chaotic.  It was her anniversary though!!! :)    Thank you again for making a stressful day much less so!  I would recommend them 100%.

This storage facility is like most I've encountered: it has some issues as the other reviews have mentioned, but overall it's a solid choice if the area works for you (that 101 S off-ramp though....).What really stood out to me was the service from David and Kacie. They've always been very friendly and helpful, working with me to get the best rates and answering any questions I have, etc. Usually basic stuff, but a lost art in the world of modern customer service. David did go above and beyond once in helping me move some heavier furniture and throw away some large trash (an office chair, etc.). Unfortunately, having your unit broken in to kind of overrides anything else I could say about this place. I was assured that the new facility was safe, with a single break-in once before a "while ago." There are a few scattered security cameras, but the outside units are not very well secured. I moved pretty much my entire life into an 8x10 to move down to LA to help my mother with an upcoming surgery. After being away for two months, I return to my unit to find out it had been broken into and ransacked, as had several other outside units. The burglars apparently ripped the lock mechanisms right off the shudders, negating them altogether. So, now I have to figure out what's gone, what's destroyed (they were obviously in a rush and tossed everything around quite a bit), and file a claim for a limited reimbursement (higher insurance protection costs more and more each month, and I opted for the basic choice given the reassurances I had that my belongings were protected).I'm surprised none of the other victims have written Yelp reviews yet. I'd be curious to know the extent of total damage done.

David and Kacie are on top of things, always looking out for their customers. Case in point: They noticed we had not properly shut and locked the unit when we left, called and confirmed that A., yes, we meant to lock it and B., they had our authorization to use the back-up key to secure the unit. They caught this less than 10 minutes after we left, called and took care of it.*Awesome* Attentive.On top of it.

Does anyone love needing to pay for extra storage in the Bay Area, when you remember living in places back east that have attic, basement, and garage? I don't! However, the staff is pleasant and helpful, and they made it clear that they wanted me to be happy with the space I chose.Unlike other storage places I've used over the years, I have always been able to find a cart. Yes, there isn't a lot of parking, but people can be creative about where to park. Once, when I parked in a marked space in front of a garage-door type storage space and the people wanted to get into their space, everyone was very nice in the way they asked me to move.Yes, the off-ramp merge from 101 is crazy-dangerous -- but I blame the state and the city for that, not Extra Space Storage. Be cautious!

Mostly very good:- Staff very friendly and helpful- Clean- Easy access to the unitThe *only* beef I have is that they did not mention the required insurance ($12 or 22 per month?) when I inquired on the phone. Even after asking if there were any hidden charges. Not a big deal, but it really should be mentioned so people can make informed decisions when deciding between facilities.

Just coming up on a month of using this storage spot. Kacie and David (the store managers) were reasonable, friendly, and helpful. Kacie showed me all of different storage units and answered all my questions. Today when I requested a short extension to the unit I had picked, they were willing to work with me and charge by the day. Overall good experience.

While the staff were quite friendly and helpful, I experienced the same 'rent rate increase' that others complained about.In addition, my unit was on the 3rd floor and the roof leaked both incredible hunks of filth and rain. For  $100 per month, one would at least expect  not to have my things rained upon and covered with large hunks of filthy dust and dirt.Don't be enticed by the low initial rental rate and be very wary of renting any unit where you have things which could be damaged by water or dirt.

As far as the facility itself goes, it is always clean, super convenient, and the employees seem friendly and helpful. If you're looking for something short term, I would recommend this place. However, I moved in to a 10x12 about a year and a half ago and my rate has now been raised twice. When I called and asked about the increases, I was informed this was a standard increase, one increase after 5 months and now I can expect to have my rate increased on a yearly basis. So, where $148 for my 10x12 was reasonable, the close to $200 I'm now paying is not. I will be relocating my belongings to a different storage facility with a more reasonable rate for long term storage.

Helped my mom rent a unit here for about 5 years. The place is always clean and secure. I've always had a very positive experience with any of the employees. Kacie was especially helpful during our move-out. She is friendly, helpful, and professional. The only reason that I do not give a full five stars is a reflection on the corp office, as they do not prorate partial months. I recommend this facility if you are looking for dependable, secure, clean storage options.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

The faclity in Santa Clara Ca is very nice. It has easy access and is very clean. The facility in Las Vegas on Las Vegas Blvd. Is quite the opposite. The unit where our storage is housed smells like urine. This is due to the homeless population that seem to have taken up residence in some of the units. I'm a little concerned about security there. So far nothing has happened . Hopefully nothing does. Overall I like Extra Space Storage and will continue to do business with them. Hopefully this will help clean up Vegas?

I want to give BOB a shout out!!! THANKS BOB FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!
KACEY was so helpful over the phone when I first found the facility online. She answered all my Questions and made my reservation super easy.
BOB He was so sweet and funny ever since I walked in through the door. Showed me the ropes to the facility, made renting the truck super easy and non stressful. Moving is a pain in the butt, so things are crazy plus bay area traffic on a Friday! Not to mention Taylor Swift show was that weekend too! BOB and DAVID got me and my group in and out before all the chaos started. BOB also made me SMILE :D he always made sure I was OK and had everything I need for the MOVE IN.
DAVID was the Icing on the cake! He was super sweet and made the transaction go smoothly. Overall I was a SUPER DUPER HAPPY CAMPER AFTER MOVING!!!! This one is for the books BEST MOVE EVER!!! Telling all my Friends and Family this is the Best Company to help Store Everything Easier!!!

I like to Say that the people at Extra Space Storage have been so kind and understanding. I had to move and put my stuff in storage and this was a hard thing for me to do, since I had my place for so long, So doing this i appreciated the empathy that their staff has for people who are moving and not finding a place and the end result is you need to put your belongings into storage, and it is no fun... my pictures my clothes my things are packed away, but Ive gone to the facility to pickup something or put something else away and the facility is always clean and the staff are friendly. I also am going thru a tuff time since I got injured at work on January 11th 2015 and have been on workmans comp to this date still, and some months my check isn't here on the first and when Extra Space Storage calls they are understanding and not yelling or threatening which is a blessing, cause I'm going thru a lot with my hand and wrist surgery and not having feelings in my right hand, to assure them I will pay as soon as I get my check and I do, its nice to know that they understand, I'm usually only maybe a few days late not like 15 or 30. I know my responsibility to them is important but knowing that they are compassionate to my feelings and knowing that I'm doing the best I can and that my personal belongings are in their storage unit, they know Im going to pay. Its just nice to talk with someone who understands that I'm storing my stuff cause I haven't found a place yet. But Im still looking but being under Dr. care is tuff.

Thank you for your professionalism
compassion and empathy your storage facility is very important to me its where my life is on hold.

Thanks again
Kim

Renting a space was quick and easy. The location was ideal since I was moving out of a warehouse and needed extra space to store items that couldn't fit elsewhere.

They also have when available - outside units which means you have 24/7 access to your stuff. Manage lives on site so your stuff is safely guarded by watchful owner! :-)

Overall I would recommend this location if you are in need of a storage. They also provide free truck to help with the move-in process.

I've rented at many storage facilities & hands down this has been the most friendly & best place I have rented from. The storage facility is clean & well maintained. The staff here is amazing & always have a great attitude. I really feel welcome whenever I need something taken care of at the front office. Also, the prices are very competitive to other facilities in the area. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to store their belongings.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

The Manager is on top of her game, she called me one night to let me 
know I left my lights on, also she called to let me know I left my lock unlocked on my storage unit.
She is the best, As far as I know this is the best place, the cleanest place and the most professional place in the bay area.

Cindy and Diana are truly very efficient and the lease papers were filled in fast. We were shown around first, were able to choose the right size of the storage by having a look at different sizes. Diana reserved the storage. Cindy called so we were able to reserve the truck for the move int. I am so grateful to not have to worry about anything, there is an automatic payment set up, she will call if anything changes (like when you get a new bank card and the online payment suddenly doesn't go through, because you forget to mention the new card number :). Thanks Cindy and Diana!

We never heard this name before (Extra Space?), but as this was close to my daughters Law School in Santa Clara, we thought that we should try it out.
Diana was the person we came in contact with. She walked us through the whole procedure and helped us finding the size of the storage room. Thank you Diana.

Received a crazy increase from a prior storage provider and was forces to relocate immediately (within 3 days) as they provide the increase right before my next schedule payment. After checking several places I decided to check out Extra Space Storage. I'm glad I did! It was a little more than I wanted to spend but overall it the facility was wonderful. The hours of access is great and longer than most. Feel a good sense of security and no crazy rules. I was thank full for the courtesy call from the representative advising my payment was due and offering the direct deduction option. In addition, taking the time to answer any questions without making me feel like an idiot or then having an attitude. I'm hoping the rates stays low and are not raised every year to some crazy amount because I really like the facility.

If you care about what you are storing you will want to store here because they care about their facility. It is immaculate.

After looking at 5 places nearby there was really no comparison. The lockers, the price, and most of all the customer service won out at every level.

This storage area is in a great location. I just don't like the rent going up every six months, because I pick this place because the rent is what I can pay. But if it goes up I will have to move my storage some where else.

Very helpful and attentive staff. Place is immaculate and spotless. After reserving on line I received a call to confirm my appointment time I set up 2 days later.   Arrived on site 2 days later, quick tour of the facility completed the paperwork and in 15 mins I was all set up. 

Impressed !







DO NOT RENT HERE..........BEWARE!!  The least friendly manager or person i have ever met.  Cindy i think her name is, was the most negative person i have ever met.  Complaining and talking bad about things she had no business speaking of.  I own a moving company, and was moving a client out of two units here, so we experienced her for a 6 hour period.  I would never in a million years recommend this place.....never never never.  i won't get into details, so i don't lower myself to her conniving underhanded manipulative sour man hating standards......DO NOT RENT HERE.  PERIOD.







My experience with this storage facility was absolutely wonderful until the store manager by the name of Cindy Hallam completely ruined it.

I called to reschedule the "Free Truck Rental" on the morning I was supposed to pick up the truck. Something that should have only taken 5 minutes turned into a 15 minutes of rant from her. I tried to tell her if no suitable reschedule date can be arranged, I'll just pick up the truck as originally planned but she cut me off mid-sentence every single time.

She repeated more than a dozen times that it's not a truck rental, it's a vehicle being loaned. Who cares? Extra space storage offered "Free Truck Rental", it's what's written on the flyer, and all I wanted was to reschedule.

Sure enough, the new date I insisted on her asking for was already booked out (at least according to her), but she went ahead and cancelled my original booking anyway. What bothered me even more was the fact that I had to call her back a couple of hours later to find out what she's done. Apparently, she "had plans" to call me.

Sadly, her condescending, arrogant personality turned something so trivial into a crisis. She failed to possess even the most basic skill in customer service: listening to the customer. She left me with no choice but to cancel not only the truck rental, but also the storage lease I had originally signed with her employer.

Judging by the number of previous complaints she's already had, I truly hope Extra Space Storage does something about her before she leaves this company's reputation in tatters.

Update: Got a call from the district manager, Mike Hurst, after I filed a formal complaint. He started the conversation by asking "how can I help you?" as if he's never read my complaint. His understanding of the whole situation was apparently: "you couldn't get a free truck, so you got upset". I asked him to read my online review and he flat out rejected.

I was not surprised at all by Mike Hurst's attitude since another Yelp reviewer has already warned about him. I don't know if this company's problem is just Mike and Cindy or its culture in general promotes hubris over humility. I guess the only way to find out is to escalate the issue to another level.







Cindy the manager was extremely rude and used high pressure sales tactics. Front desk staff is very unfriendly and incompetent. Avoid this place.







Amazing experience. Clean and very competitive rates. Everyone at the front office were very helpful.
Plenty of units with drive up access which is awesome.







By far the worst customer service experience I've ever had. From the facilities manager CINDY, to the District Manager MIKE Hurst. 

Do not be fooled by their 4.5 star reviews.  I usually do not feel the need to complain or write bad reviews, but what I am about to tell you will help you see why.

Due to tough times my father was in a rush to move out of his apartment (financial issues). His good friend bought him a storage to store his personal belongings. My dads friend got him the storage on 3/14/2016, and you would figure Extra Space Storage would offer a 24-48 hours access for new movers (like most storage places do).  That wasn't the case, on 3/15/2016 my uncle, cousin and myself spend the entire day making trips with my dad loading his belongings into the unit. Around 930pm we arrived back at his storage unit with the last load. An older lady (customer) informed my family and I that we should unload the truck and leave the items on the ground to take our truck outside the gate. She stated that she had to leave her car overnight before because she stayed 10mins past 10pm (closing time).  We thanked her for the heads up and did what she said. 

Here is where Cindy the manager that lives there comes into the picture. We walk back to the items that we unloaded outside the storage. We continued to load up the cart and make trips to the storage (inside the first bay). It was 9:58pm and Cindy yells and my uncle, cousin and I saying "you guys need to get off my property or I will call the cops on you". I am going to be honest on this entire situation. Cindy Is a Caucasian woman and my family and I are Mexican (I never discriminate, in this case I felt judged for my family and nationality). My uncle who is a recovering alcoholic doesn't really speak well (being that he is older, and due to his alcohol use in the past). My uncle and cousin were scare of the cops being called on them so started walking down the ramp to leave the facilities. Mind you there truck in on the other side of the gate, behind Cindy.  I tried to talk to Cindy, but when I was walking towards her to talk she walked away (later to find out that she said she was "scared and felt threaten"). My cousin and uncle leave, while I stay behind to finish loading in my father's belongings. I get to the final box and Cindy yells at me saying "I am calling the cops on you".  In the upmost right respect I explained to her the situation, she told me "I have guest over right now and do not have time for this, hurry up and leave my property".

I was able to speak with Cindy on this matter early this morning, as I stated she said she felt threaten and scared. Yet we didn't say or do anything wrong towards her. She also accused my uncle and cousin of being drunk just based off of there image. She also told me she heard yelling from us, I asked her what we were yelling but she couldn't tell me anything (she made it up).  Cindy also said that she didn't no if we were stealing or if we even belonged there, mind you this was our 10-12 trip there throughout the day, and we never took anything from the place only loaded stuff in.

I went through the appropriate channels to make a complaint on Cindy. The lady that I spoke to on the phone from Extra Space Storage was appalled with how Cindy threatened and treated us, so she filed a report to the District Manager Mike Hurst.  

Mike was extremely rude and disrespectful to me on the phone, he told me that my father or I wasn't welcomed to the storage and ended the call by saying I am not a paying customer to him and hung up on me. Little does he know that I actual have two storage units at a different Extra Space Storage location, which I will be cancelling this weekend as I move my stuff out.

Mike and Cindy have horrible customer service skills and are quick to yell and raise their voice. I DO NOT get how either of these two individuals are in management roles. If I could I would try to go above Mike and speak to his boss but don't know how.
I felt violated in so many was, but mostly felt that I was judged do to being a Latin American male.







This was an excellent choice!! Great, friendly service with awesome prices. This is a step up from your normal public storage if you are in this area and need a safe place to store your personals then extra storage is the place for you!!







I needed a storage unit after my bf and I broke up. I found this place since it is close to where I am currently living. They had told me the unit I got was $129. They had a sign that is out in the front advertising first month free and the first time I went there to look at the place, someone told me yes that is true. When I finally went in to sign the documents, I was told it is no longer valid and the promotion expired yesterday. So here I am thinking they just have not had time to take it down yet. It is now 5 months later and it is still there...false advertisement much?? 

I went online to make a payment this morning and saw that my payment increased $19 dollars. When I called to ask, they told me there is an increase after 5 months BUT after that I will not see another increase for another 9months. Wow! Lucky me! How nice of them to NOT have disclose this to me when thy rushed me to sign all the agreements. Note...I do blame myself for not looking closely at the disclosures but I would think that would be disclosed right off the bat.

Also, when I asked about the first months rent free sign and told them what I was told when I first rented it and how I was told it expired. The lady on the phone says it depends on the percentage of the unit rented. Guess they need to keep their stories straight. Which is it?? Expired or depending on the percentage of rentals?? So basically it's whenever the hell they feel like it is.  That's how it sounded to me. There is no expiration date like the original person told me. 

So in the end, I got cheated out of the first months rent when it should have been free as advertised. Second I have to pay for increasing rent. So needless to say I am going to try to clear out my unit as soon as possible before they decide to increase it again. Argh!!







The service is exemplary. The facility is new and extremely well-maintained. Security is managed with high-tech technology that keeps track of everyone on the premises and which units are open. They gave me the internet quoted price which is saving me over $10 a month. I have used Extra Space Storage in NC before and was happy with the service, and this location is no exception. Thank you for being the best in class.







2 stars only because I have no complaints regarding the storage space or facility but customer service is something less than desirable. Made a reservation online for a specific date but immediately started receiving daily phone calls asking me to tour the site and rent early "to lock in the price". Why have reservations if you wont hold a unit or price...isn't that the point of making a RESERVATION? Then when I go in to pay for the unit...surprise...there is an additional processing fee plus required (and very expensive) insurance. I have renters insurance for $25000 coverage and pay less than $14/mo but this place charges $32 for only $5000 coverage! The original advertised price went from $148/mo to nearly $200! Hmm...bait and switch technique. They also offered a free moving truck but apparently only have one truck available for all of their facilities. So obviously, this service was not available and I now have to rent a truck from U-Haul. The website also offers "first month free" but that was not available for the unit I chose...so which units do qualify? Apparently none because they are not available at this time. They also asked to keep my credit card info on file even after I stated that I was paying cash. With all the hackers stealing credit card info...I do not want my card # on file anywhere, especially at this place and they don't need it! If I wasn't combining storage with my boyfriend (who already has a unit at the place) I would have gone elsewhere! Best part...a gentleman had been waiting outside when I arrived but the lady at the desk made him wait again just because I came in the door first. The man mentioned that the "be back soon" sign was up when he arrived and the time changed twice while he was waiting. I offered for him to be helped first but the lady made him step out of the office so she could lock up and left him waiting again. Totally rude no matter how many times you apologize for the inconvenience. Really bad customer service!!







Just got my first storage unit and this place is clean!!! Great staff too :) thank you







cons: they are strict and authoritative. The prices soared up suddenly .

pros: Very clean, highly secured. easy online payments. The prices were very inexpensive for parking my car for the first 7 months. ( last 2 months it became 75% higher!!!).







I stored my stuff here two months ago. I had a very bad experience there was false advertisement it said the first months rent was a dollar. Once I chose the unit that I wanted and it was time to pay that's when they told me that the unit I just picked was not on the special one dollar for the unit i chose. 
 Then they talked me into staying there and they gave me half off.
 Then after 3 months they raise the rent on me







I only needed extra storage for 2 months. Cindy and Pasha were professional, friendly & honest. The property was clean, well mantained and very safe.
I would recommend Extra Space Storage to my friends & family







This is a wonderful storage place.  We used them several years ago and had a great experience so went back when we were in need of a storage place.  Cindy and her staff are professional, welcoming and friendly.  The units are clean and I always feel safe when I am over there.  I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage.







Many storage places to choose from. If cleanliness, modern, security, management makes the difference (since sizes are the same everywhere) then this facility is great. Cindy has been the mgr since the beginning which says a lot. She knows her biz, reps the brand well and is great to see each time ur there. Thanks Cindy as we just emptied the last of all our units after 4 years. John n Pam







This facility is well administered, clean, secure and very friendly. We would recommend it for it's easy access from the freeway and it's spacious layout. The front office always was professional and diligent in regards to billing, cleanliness of the building and attention to detail. We used this site for several years and will come back if the need arises.







Cindy the manager of this facility has very poor customer service. She always has an attitude while talking to people. I don't think having new business is of importance to this lady or this company. I would not recommend this facility to anyone unless they enjoy being talked to in a very condescending manner. My advice to the company is choose the managers with an extra ordinary customer service skills not with lack of customer service skills. We can get better customer service at safeway by a cashier rather than your condescending manager Cindy.







I 've been rented a space here  for   six months and they are increasing my rent of $82 to $142. Is this a good  storage facility?







Fantastic experience!  We needed a couple of months of temporary storage (Spring 2011) for a garage makeover.  This is a new facility; real clean.  We really lucked out - got a great drive up access unit (for the motorcycle).  Great crew to work with also.  I'd come here again if I needed storage!

By far the worst customer service experience I've ever had. From the facilities manager CINDY, to the District Manager MIKE Hurst. Do not be fooled by their 4.5 star reviews.  I usually do not feel the need to complain or write bad reviews, but what I am about to tell you will help you see why.Due to tough times my father was in a rush to move out of his apartment (financial issues). His good friend bought him a storage to store his personal belongings. My dads friend got him the storage on 3/14/2016, and you would figure Extra Space Storage would offer a 24-48 hours access for new movers (like most storage places do).  That wasn't the case, on 3/15/2016 my uncle, cousin and myself spend the entire day making trips with my dad loading his belongings into the unit. Around 930pm we arrived back at his storage unit with the last load. An older lady (customer) informed my family and I that we should unload the truck and leave the items on the ground to take our truck outside the gate. She stated that she had to leave her car overnight before because she stayed 10mins past 10pm (closing time).  We thanked her for the heads up and did what she said. Here is where Cindy the manager that lives there comes into the picture. We walk back to the items that we unloaded outside the storage. We continued to load up the cart and make trips to the storage (inside the first bay). It was 9:58pm and Cindy yells and my uncle, cousin and I saying "you guys need to get off my property or I will call the cops on you". I am going to be honest on this entire situation. Cindy Is a Caucasian woman and my family and I are Mexican (I never discriminate, in this case I felt judged for my family and nationality). My uncle who is a recovering alcoholic doesn't really speak well (being that he is older, and due to his alcohol use in the past). My uncle and cousin were scare of the cops being called on them so started walking down the ramp to leave the facilities. Mind you there truck in on the other side of the gate, behind Cindy.  I tried to talk to Cindy, but when I was walking towards her to talk she walked away (later to find out that she said she was "scared and felt threaten"). My cousin and uncle leave, while I stay behind to finish loading in my father's belongings. I get to the final box and Cindy yells at me saying "I am calling the cops on you".  In the upmost right respect I explained to her the situation, she told me "I have guest over right now and do not have time for this, hurry up and leave my property".I was able to speak with Cindy on this matter early this morning, as I stated she said she felt threaten and scared. Yet we didn't say or do anything wrong towards her. She also accused my uncle and cousin of being drunk just based off of there image. She also told me she heard yelling from us, I asked her what we were yelling but she couldn't tell me anything (she made it up).  Cindy also said that she didn't no if we were stealing or if we even belonged there, mind you this was our 10-12 trip there throughout the day, and we never took anything from the place only loaded stuff in.I went through the appropriate channels to make a complaint on Cindy. The lady that I spoke to on the phone from Extra Space Storage was appalled with how Cindy threatened and treated us, so she filed a report to the District Manager Mike Hurst.  Mike was extremely rude and disrespectful to me on the phone, he told me that my father or I wasn't welcomed to the storage and ended the call by saying I am not a paying customer to him and hung up on me. Little does he know that I actual have two storage units at a different Extra Space Storage location, which I will be cancelling this weekend as I move my stuff out.Mike and Cindy have horrible customer service skills and are quick to yell and raise their voice. I DO NOT get how either of these two individuals are in management roles. If I could I would try to go above Mike and speak to his boss but don't know how.I felt violated in so many was, but mostly felt that I was judged do to being a Latin American male.

This was an excellent choice!! Great, friendly service with awesome prices. This is a step up from your normal public storage if you are in this area and need a safe place to store your personals then extra storage is the place for you!!

I needed a storage unit after my bf and I broke up. I found this place since it is close to where I am currently living. They had told me the unit I got was $129. They had a sign that is out in the front advertising first month free and the first time I went there to look at the place, someone told me yes that is true. When I finally went in to sign the documents, I was told it is no longer valid and the promotion expired yesterday. So here I am thinking they just have not had time to take it down yet. It is now 5 months later and it is still there...false advertisement much?? I went online to make a payment this morning and saw that my payment increased $19 dollars. When I called to ask, they told me there is an increase after 5 months BUT after that I will not see another increase for another 9months. Wow! Lucky me! How nice of them to NOT have disclose this to me when thy rushed me to sign all the agreements. Note...I do blame myself for not looking closely at the disclosures but I would think that would be disclosed right off the bat.Also, when I asked about the first months rent free sign and told them what I was told when I first rented it and how I was told it expired. The lady on the phone says it depends on the percentage of the unit rented. Guess they need to keep their stories straight. Which is it?? Expired or depending on the percentage of rentals?? So basically it's whenever the hell they feel like it is.  That's how it sounded to me. There is no expiration date like the original person told me. So in the end, I got cheated out of the first months rent when it should have been free as advertised. Second I have to pay for increasing rent. So needless to say I am going to try to clear out my unit as soon as possible before they decide to increase it again. Argh!!

The service is exemplary. The facility is new and extremely well-maintained. Security is managed with high-tech technology that keeps track of everyone on the premises and which units are open. They gave me the internet quoted price which is saving me over $10 a month. I have used Extra Space Storage in NC before and was happy with the service, and this location is no exception. Thank you for being the best in class.

2 stars only because I have no complaints regarding the storage space or facility but customer service is something less than desirable. Made a reservation online for a specific date but immediately started receiving daily phone calls asking me to tour the site and rent early "to lock in the price". Why have reservations if you wont hold a unit or price...isn't that the point of making a RESERVATION? Then when I go in to pay for the unit...surprise...there is an additional processing fee plus required (and very expensive) insurance. I have renters insurance for $25000 coverage and pay less than $14/mo but this place charges $32 for only $5000 coverage! The original advertised price went from $148/mo to nearly $200! Hmm...bait and switch technique. They also offered a free moving truck but apparently only have one truck available for all of their facilities. So obviously, this service was not available and I now have to rent a truck from U-Haul. The website also offers "first month free" but that was not available for the unit I chose...so which units do qualify? Apparently none because they are not available at this time. They also asked to keep my credit card info on file even after I stated that I was paying cash. With all the hackers stealing credit card info...I do not want my card # on file anywhere, especially at this place and they don't need it! If I wasn't combining storage with my boyfriend (who already has a unit at the place) I would have gone elsewhere! Best part...a gentleman had been waiting outside when I arrived but the lady at the desk made him wait again just because I came in the door first. The man mentioned that the "be back soon" sign was up when he arrived and the time changed twice while he was waiting. I offered for him to be helped first but the lady made him step out of the office so she could lock up and left him waiting again. Totally rude no matter how many times you apologize for the inconvenience. Really bad customer service!!

I stored my stuff here two months ago. I had a very bad experience there was false advertisement it said the first months rent was a dollar. Once I chose the unit that I wanted and it was time to pay that's when they told me that the unit I just picked was not on the special one dollar for the unit i chose.  Then they talked me into staying there and they gave me half off. Then after 3 months they raise the rent on me

Many storage places to choose from. If cleanliness, modern, security, management makes the difference (since sizes are the same everywhere) then this facility is great. Cindy has been the mgr since the beginning which says a lot. She knows her biz, reps the brand well and is great to see each time ur there. Thanks Cindy as we just emptied the last of all our units after 4 years. John n Pam

This facility is well administered, clean, secure and very friendly. We would recommend it for it's easy access from the freeway and it's spacious layout. The front office always was professional and diligent in regards to billing, cleanliness of the building and attention to detail. We used this site for several years and will come back if the need arises.

Cindy the manager of this facility has very poor customer service. She always has an attitude while talking to people. I don't think having new business is of importance to this lady or this company. I would not recommend this facility to anyone unless they enjoy being talked to in a very condescending manner. My advice to the company is choose the managers with an extra ordinary customer service skills not with lack of customer service skills. We can get better customer service at safeway by a cashier rather than your condescending manager Cindy.

Fantastic experience!  We needed a couple of months of temporary storage (Spring 2011) for a garage makeover.  This is a new facility; real clean.  We really lucked out - got a great drive up access unit (for the motorcycle).  Great crew to work with also.  I'd come here again if I needed storage!

This is a new storage space, brightly lit, very clean, well managed, and has alarm in every unit.  Front desk staffs were very friendly and helpful.  Location is great, right on Scott Blvd., between Walsh and Central Expwy.  We felt save going there at night.  They showed us the unit before renting it.  We rent it an 8x10 unit with drive up access for 2 months.  Got the rate as advertised, $140/month with 1st month free.  So we paid $140 for 2 months.  We also need to pay $9 for insurance.  That's the only extra.  They do offer lock for $9 but we had our own lock.  We compared this to several other storage spaces, and this has the best rate and best facility.  Overall, it's a great storage place and we were completely satisfied with it.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.

5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.

10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.

10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

The Manager is on top of her game, she called me one night to let me 
know I left my lights on, also she called to let me know I left my lock unlocked on my storage unit.
She is the best, As far as I know this is the best place, the cleanest place and the most professional place in the bay area.

Your automatic payment information is removed should there be a problem processing credit card. Then once removed you cannot add it back on the same day you pay your bill.

Cindy and Diana are truly very efficient and the lease papers were filled in fast. We were shown around first, were able to choose the right size of the storage by having a look at different sizes. Diana reserved the storage. Cindy called so we were able to reserve the truck for the move int. I am so grateful to not have to worry about anything, there is an automatic payment set up, she will call if anything changes (like when you get a new bank card and the online payment suddenly doesn't go through, because you forget to mention the new card number :). Thanks Cindy and Diana!

We never heard this name before (Extra Space?), but as this was close to my daughters Law School in Santa Clara, we thought that we should try it out.
Diana was the person we came in contact with. She walked us through the whole procedure and helped us finding the size of the storage room. Thank you Diana.

Received a crazy increase from a prior storage provider and was forces to relocate immediately (within 3 days) as they provide the increase right before my next schedule payment. After checking several places I decided to check out Extra Space Storage. I'm glad I did! It was a little more than I wanted to spend but overall it the facility was wonderful. The hours of access is great and longer than most. Feel a good sense of security and no crazy rules. I was thank full for the courtesy call from the representative advising my payment was due and offering the direct deduction option. In addition, taking the time to answer any questions without making me feel like an idiot or then having an attitude. I'm hoping the rates stays low and are not raised every year to some crazy amount because I really like the facility.

If you care about what you are storing you will want to store here because they care about their facility. It is immaculate.

After looking at 5 places nearby there was really no comparison. The lockers, the price, and most of all the customer service won out at every level.

This storage area is in a great location. I just don't like the rent going up every six months, because I pick this place because the rent is what I can pay. But if it goes up I will have to move my storage some where else.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes.

Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.

It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.

I went to the Extra Space right off 101 and Montague and was met by a very friendly rep who was patient. I then left and went to the Extra Space off Lawrence just behind Costco and I can't say enough about the great customer service I received. They were very patient and made you feel comfortable. I'll definitely refer them to anyone looking for a storage space!

My father had a bad fall and we needed to secure 1-2 cars. My sister called around to different storage companies in the south bay/California from Washington state until she reached Extra Space Storage/Mark Godfrey. I know we are very demanding when it comes to the amount of information we require to make a decision and he was very helpful, kind, compassionate, and thorough. I dropped by to take a look at the storage spaces and found the grounds to be clean and secure. We discussed what information was needed regarding our situation and arrived with vehicle and paperwork needed. If all their staff is as professional as Mark Godfrey, we highly recommend this company to store your stuff.

PLEASE SEE THIS PLACE... I came over to see David on my lunch break. In 15 mins I was signing my simple electronic agreement and out the door before I knew it. This place is spotless, the office is in perfect condition, the unit was clean and ready for use. I even got to ride on a golf cart.  Truly a pleasant experience, moving is so stressful, it's always at the worst times and DAVID made my day. This man follows procedure to the "T". Not one detail was left out, we spoke about any typical concern with ease and really made this a easy item to check off. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXACT LOCATION 

Thank You David







Mark was very helpful!  I would give him 20 stars if possible.  Got me as a brand new customer with in 25mins and we rushed..... so make sure you make time ahead of time and do your research because it takes awhile to do anything.

Dude helped me save money which is awesome.....  Thank you!!!!


Why is the review kind of low......well when you sign the contract their is an Arbitration clause!!!!  Wtf!? Is this a credit card or a storage company.  How can you provide me a friendly service yet you slap me with this thing?  I'm not a fan of storage in general but the service was really good!!!! 

I guess they have a business storage as well.







Really nice people! It was quick and easy to get the storage. I have relatives that have rented from here and never complained once! Very happy with this place.







Great service and location.
Units are clean. As advertised.







Great place!  when leaving is kinda tricky to maneuver to get back to main hwy..

I have been a customer for almost a year.
I have upgraded my unit from a 5x5 to a 5x10 with no issues, but today I tried to upgrade from my 5x10 to a 5x15 and was told the web rate is only for new customers.
I received the web rate for my previous upgrade, but it is unavailable for this upgrade.

I talked to corporate and they explained that "web rate" is actually a NEW CUSTOMER rate, and also that if I close my account it must be closed for 3 months before I can be considered a new customer again.

I guess I will take my business elsewhere, since they do not want my money.

Edit/Update since the owner responded to me:
Do you not understand what the word "web" means? it does not mean "new customer" it means INTERNET WEB SITE. "Web rate" therefor means the rate you get from the web site. It does not imply new customer AT ALL nor is that written ON THE SITE. So it comes out as a scam. THEN your company DID let me upgrade at the web rate once no problem, that just reinforces the concept that it's a scam! You apply the rate when you want to, and not when you don't.

Everything about this experience was shady, and your company has only three things going for it: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Your customer service both local and corporate is atrocious, your pricing is scammy, and the facility is nothing special by any stretch of the imagination. Seriously what kind of customer service representative actually verbally fights with an irate customer? Send them back to training, if they even had any.

Summary of the two rate plans from this company:
"Web" rate: The rate new customers are charged even if they walk in off the street and have never heard of the internet.
Normal rate: The much higher rate they only charge loyal existing customers for being so troublesome as to upgrade or downgrade their unit.

I guess they'd rather have a huge amount of turnover than loyal customers.







This was so fast and easy to book the storage space. I reserved an available spot online, arrived and met David who was not only ready for me but also guessed who I was. We went through the process of signing the paper work and he even informed me that I could use my own insurance to cover the items I was going to store. He got me set and I was in the unit dropping my gear off with in half an hour. Thank you for being so clear and efficient!







Before Extra Space Storage bought out this facility it was great. But now, customer service is way down and they are jacking the rates sky-high!!!!! BEWARE - my unit has increased almost 40% in the las 14 months alone, so NOT cool!   (The facility has mad no improvements during these increases. Just a post card every three months to say your rate is going up another $30, $50, $60 per month)







The facility itself is top-notch. It's clean and well kept, they have gated access 6 AM through 10 PM, and there are copious security cameras. The only thing missing is alarms on the doors themselves, and I've never actually seen a facility that does that (though clearly some do, since there's a checkbox for it on the list attached to the empty units here).

Why only three stars? When you visit the website, they give you a "web rate". Don't expect to pay this amount.

First, there's mandatory insurance, which I couldn't actually find mentioned anywhere on the website, even after the fact. Not sure if your homeowner's or render's insurance covers storage, or didn't think to look for outside insurance? (Why would you?) That's an extra $14 per month.

Then there's the administration fee -- also conveniently not mentioned anywhere during the reservation process. Between the insurance and administration fee, the 50% off deal I got through the online reservation disappeared pretty quickly.

Ironically, the price, location, and facility were still decent enough after adding insurance that I didn't just walk out and store elsewhere. All they had to do was be upfront rather than dropping one hidden fee after another during the signup process. I guess it gets people in the door, but it certainly doesn't inspire confidence in the long-term viability of the arrangement.

I would be hesitant to use this facility if I were renting anything but the smallest unit whose contents I can easily move.

Update 5/25/17: I really have to take off another star at this point for pricing shenanigans. First of all, in a period of only 9 months, my monthly cost for a 5x10 interior unit (yes, I did upgrade by one notch) has gone up from $104 to $120 and then *again* to $137. That's over 30% in 9 months, and they don't even have the courtesy to send out a notification of the change. You just see the new price on the next bill and/or autopay receipt.

Worse, they're still advertising this kind of unit online, 3 months after the last price increase and already into the busier summer season with only 1 unit available, with a "web rate" of $89 and "on site" rate of $124. Why am I paying $137? I guess because they figure the cost of moving outweighs the mysterious extra $13 I'm paying. (Hey, at least I'm no longer paying the ridiculous $14 per month for insurance.) Honestly, again, if Extra Space could just be upfront about their pricing I'd have very little to complain about.







I got a storage here after moving to a smaller place.  David was super helpful and amazing. He gave me tips on how I should get the most of my storage space. It's clean and secured. I was given access to the moving truck when I moved in. I thought was a nice bonus. I'm very happy.







These guys were fabulous!  I needed a place to store my car ASAP and they were able to offer me a spot, get me into the office, handle all the paperwork, provide me with easy access, and get me on my way.  They were lifesavers and I couldn't say enough nice things about the entire process.  What a crew!







I do not know about others who reviewed Extra Space Storage with such poor reviews, but our experience was excellent.
We contacted Extra Space Storage about a space for our RV and David was extremely friendly and helpful.  We needed 35 feet and David put us on the list so when we purchased our RV we had a place to store it. When we found the space was hard to park our RV, David once again came through with a new space that allowed us to park without issue.
I would certainly recommend Extra Space Storage for anyone needed a convenient large place to store an RV or trailer.







This is a mixed review about All Aboard in Sunnyvale.  Overall, a negative impression.

Pros: Well kept facility (not too dirty or cobwebby), can pay online, security pretty serious, close to where I live.

Cons: After you've been there a few months, they jack up the monthly payment due

I started renting there through a special promotion that ran out. Cool, exactly what I expected.  Then  4 months in, I get a letter saying the rent will go up $2 more than I'm currently paying.  I go to make a payment and see that it actually went up $11 dollars more my current price.  What the hay?!  

I call the corporate office, they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough telling me to call Sunnyvale.  Sunnyvale says they can't control the rental price changes or what's in the letters sent to Customers.  Gee, awesome customer service.  Of course, it's a big deal to move out of the storage unit so they really got you by the short hairs.  I'm hoping the price doesn't go up too much more before I can get out of there.

Beware.  A warning to others before they get trapped in the rising storage rental fees.

I've rented storage at other facilities around the San Francisco Bay Area.  This is the first time I've experienced something like this rental fees hustle.







My first experience with a storage facility was very easy and smooth. Kristopher and David (?) made the experience a pleasant one, good to know they will be watching over the facility. The site is clean and the gate is always closed. Turning out to be a good move?







Thank you Mark for helping me out today. I was literally in and out for selection of a unit. Experience was smooth and free of complications. Mark was Very friendly and informative. He answered all our questions and leaving us satisfied with his knowledge. Definitely will recommend this place.







I stored a travel trailer here for about 6 months. Front office staff was always friendly. I never had to worry about the trailer I felt it was safe here and never had a problem. I would definitely use them again.







DO NOT RENT FROM THIS FACILITY.  the people who run this place is absolutely nasty.  If you are there minutes after closing time, the old man comes and yells at you.   Also be careful when you send a check for payment.  We were assessed  a "late" fee when we sent payment on time and even when we proved they had cashed our check.







I had worst experiences in this place.  I don't know a old lady works there is the owner or not.  No matter what she is, she treats customers with absolutely no respect at all.  You will wonder who is paying to who to get the services.  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE..  When I think about it, the old lady has to be the owner of the place and that has to be the only way possible that she treats customers like dirt.   Maybe she doesn't care one more customer more less wont make her life any better or worse.  Or she is one of the remaining old white supremacist still living in a big town.







the manager uses the "bait & switch" approach when you sign online for $1 move in + the administration costs ($20) but wants you to pay the following month up front also so the total to move in is like $100 bucks.  and they'll have you sign your contract and everything so u should be prepared to have the 2nd month's  worth of rent up front the day you move in otherwise don't go here. i ended up going to publicstroage.com

PLEASE SEE THIS PLACE... I came over to see David on my lunch break. In 15 mins I was signing my simple electronic agreement and out the door before I knew it. This place is spotless, the office is in perfect condition, the unit was clean and ready for use. I even got to ride on a golf cart.  Truly a pleasant experience, moving is so stressful, it's always at the worst times and DAVID made my day. This man follows procedure to the "T". Not one detail was left out, we spoke about any typical concern with ease and really made this a easy item to check off. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXACT LOCATION Thank You David

Mark was very helpful!  I would give him 20 stars if possible.  Got me as a brand new customer with in 25mins and we rushed..... so make sure you make time ahead of time and do your research because it takes awhile to do anything.Dude helped me save money which is awesome.....  Thank you!!!!Why is the review kind of low......well when you sign the contract their is an Arbitration clause!!!!  Wtf!? Is this a credit card or a storage company.  How can you provide me a friendly service yet you slap me with this thing?  I'm not a fan of storage in general but the service was really good!!!! I guess they have a business storage as well.

I have been a customer for almost a year.I have upgraded my unit from a 5x5 to a 5x10 with no issues, but today I tried to upgrade from my 5x10 to a 5x15 and was told the web rate is only for new customers.I received the web rate for my previous upgrade, but it is unavailable for this upgrade.I talked to corporate and they explained that "web rate" is actually a NEW CUSTOMER rate, and also that if I close my account it must be closed for 3 months before I can be considered a new customer again.I guess I will take my business elsewhere, since they do not want my money.Edit/Update since the owner responded to me:Do you not understand what the word "web" means? it does not mean "new customer" it means INTERNET WEB SITE. "Web rate" therefor means the rate you get from the web site. It does not imply new customer AT ALL nor is that written ON THE SITE. So it comes out as a scam. THEN your company DID let me upgrade at the web rate once no problem, that just reinforces the concept that it's a scam! You apply the rate when you want to, and not when you don't.Everything about this experience was shady, and your company has only three things going for it: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Your customer service both local and corporate is atrocious, your pricing is scammy, and the facility is nothing special by any stretch of the imagination. Seriously what kind of customer service representative actually verbally fights with an irate customer? Send them back to training, if they even had any.Summary of the two rate plans from this company:"Web" rate: The rate new customers are charged even if they walk in off the street and have never heard of the internet.Normal rate: The much higher rate they only charge loyal existing customers for being so troublesome as to upgrade or downgrade their unit.I guess they'd rather have a huge amount of turnover than loyal customers.

This was so fast and easy to book the storage space. I reserved an available spot online, arrived and met David who was not only ready for me but also guessed who I was. We went through the process of signing the paper work and he even informed me that I could use my own insurance to cover the items I was going to store. He got me set and I was in the unit dropping my gear off with in half an hour. Thank you for being so clear and efficient!

Before Extra Space Storage bought out this facility it was great. But now, customer service is way down and they are jacking the rates sky-high!!!!! BEWARE - my unit has increased almost 40% in the las 14 months alone, so NOT cool!   (The facility has mad no improvements during these increases. Just a post card every three months to say your rate is going up another $30, $50, $60 per month)

The facility itself is top-notch. It's clean and well kept, they have gated access 6 AM through 10 PM, and there are copious security cameras. The only thing missing is alarms on the doors themselves, and I've never actually seen a facility that does that (though clearly some do, since there's a checkbox for it on the list attached to the empty units here).Why only three stars? When you visit the website, they give you a "web rate". Don't expect to pay this amount.First, there's mandatory insurance, which I couldn't actually find mentioned anywhere on the website, even after the fact. Not sure if your homeowner's or render's insurance covers storage, or didn't think to look for outside insurance? (Why would you?) That's an extra $14 per month.Then there's the administration fee -- also conveniently not mentioned anywhere during the reservation process. Between the insurance and administration fee, the 50% off deal I got through the online reservation disappeared pretty quickly.Ironically, the price, location, and facility were still decent enough after adding insurance that I didn't just walk out and store elsewhere. All they had to do was be upfront rather than dropping one hidden fee after another during the signup process. I guess it gets people in the door, but it certainly doesn't inspire confidence in the long-term viability of the arrangement.I would be hesitant to use this facility if I were renting anything but the smallest unit whose contents I can easily move.Update 5/25/17: I really have to take off another star at this point for pricing shenanigans. First of all, in a period of only 9 months, my monthly cost for a 5x10 interior unit (yes, I did upgrade by one notch) has gone up from $104 to $120 and then *again* to $137. That's over 30% in 9 months, and they don't even have the courtesy to send out a notification of the change. You just see the new price on the next bill and/or autopay receipt.Worse, they're still advertising this kind of unit online, 3 months after the last price increase and already into the busier summer season with only 1 unit available, with a "web rate" of $89 and "on site" rate of $124. Why am I paying $137? I guess because they figure the cost of moving outweighs the mysterious extra $13 I'm paying. (Hey, at least I'm no longer paying the ridiculous $14 per month for insurance.) Honestly, again, if Extra Space could just be upfront about their pricing I'd have very little to complain about.

I do not know about others who reviewed Extra Space Storage with such poor reviews, but our experience was excellent.We contacted Extra Space Storage about a space for our RV and David was extremely friendly and helpful.  We needed 35 feet and David put us on the list so when we purchased our RV we had a place to store it. When we found the space was hard to park our RV, David once again came through with a new space that allowed us to park without issue.I would certainly recommend Extra Space Storage for anyone needed a convenient large place to store an RV or trailer.

This is a mixed review about All Aboard in Sunnyvale.  Overall, a negative impression.Pros: Well kept facility (not too dirty or cobwebby), can pay online, security pretty serious, close to where I live.Cons: After you've been there a few months, they jack up the monthly payment dueI started renting there through a special promotion that ran out. Cool, exactly what I expected.  Then  4 months in, I get a letter saying the rent will go up $2 more than I'm currently paying.  I go to make a payment and see that it actually went up $11 dollars more my current price.  What the hay?!  I call the corporate office, they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough telling me to call Sunnyvale.  Sunnyvale says they can't control the rental price changes or what's in the letters sent to Customers.  Gee, awesome customer service.  Of course, it's a big deal to move out of the storage unit so they really got you by the short hairs.  I'm hoping the price doesn't go up too much more before I can get out of there.Beware.  A warning to others before they get trapped in the rising storage rental fees.I've rented storage at other facilities around the San Francisco Bay Area.  This is the first time I've experienced something like this rental fees hustle.

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS FACILITY.  the people who run this place is absolutely nasty.  If you are there minutes after closing time, the old man comes and yells at you.   Also be careful when you send a check for payment.  We were assessed  a "late" fee when we sent payment on time and even when we proved they had cashed our check.

I had worst experiences in this place.  I don't know a old lady works there is the owner or not.  No matter what she is, she treats customers with absolutely no respect at all.  You will wonder who is paying to who to get the services.  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE..  When I think about it, the old lady has to be the owner of the place and that has to be the only way possible that she treats customers like dirt.   Maybe she doesn't care one more customer more less wont make her life any better or worse.  Or she is one of the remaining old white supremacist still living in a big town.

the manager uses the "bait & switch" approach when you sign online for $1 move in + the administration costs ($20) but wants you to pay the following month up front also so the total to move in is like $100 bucks.  and they'll have you sign your contract and everything so u should be prepared to have the 2nd month's  worth of rent up front the day you move in otherwise don't go here. i ended up going to publicstroage.com

                Jason and Shannon took over the facility about a year ago (so disregard any yelp reviews before 2011) and have surpassed my expectations.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

Noa

I went to the Extra Space right off 101 and Montague and was met by a very friendly rep who was patient. I then left and went to the Extra Space off Lawrence just behind Costco and I can't say enough about the great customer service I received. They were very patient and made you feel comfortable. I'll definitely refer them to anyone looking for a storage space!

John

My father had a bad fall and we needed to secure 1-2 cars. My sister called around to different storage companies in the south bay/California from Washington state until she reached Extra Space Storage/Mark Godfrey. I know we are very demanding when it comes to the amount of information we require to make a decision and he was very helpful, kind, compassionate, and thorough. I dropped by to take a look at the storage spaces and found the grounds to be clean and secure. We discussed what information was needed regarding our situation and arrived with vehicle and paperwork needed. If all their staff is as professional as Mark Godfrey, we highly recommend this company to store your stuff.

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

Terrific move in experience. Clean, secure, and courteous. The owners actually work in the office and were great. I am quite happy to have chosen this storage facility site unseen. I was even able to check in to my California rental and gain my access code from a franchise in NJ - in order to save time and enable moving in after office hours.

Ray was amazing! After a comprehensive search of Bay Area, peninsula area storage facilities, I just opened a rental unit here at this location and the service was the best I've experienced at any business.  I feel confident that my things will be safe here, especially due to the on-site, live-in manager.  They are having a great move-in deal and I received half off the first month's rent.  Ray is the manager on duty currently.  He's normally the manager at the Redwood City location, but is here while the new manager of Menlo Park gets settled in.   

Thanks for storing my stuff!







This place is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! The place is infested with rats and the staff will not do anything about it!  We have spoken with staff and informed them of the situation and informed them of how much stuff was damaged.  They will not reimburse or pay for professional cleaning.  Beware!!! Do not use them unless you want your belongings ruined by rat droppings, urine and nesting in your furniture! Terrible customer service!! We used three different storage rooms and all three have had rat droppings!!







The storage is clean, the place is very safe and Felix who is the store manage was very helpful and kind.







Recently rented a storage unit from Felix at Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park.  He and his wife are very friendly and professional.  They keep the facility very clean which I appreciate. They called me to confirm our appointment time before arrival and when I arrived Felix drove me around the facility to show me all the available options for storage unit locations so that I felt comfortable with the distance from the gate.  They also made a follow up call to make sure I was happy with the facility and my storage unit.  I would highly recommend this facility.  It is clean, convenient, and the rental prices are very competitive.







My family kept our belongings here for over a year. We rested well knowing that things would be secured and protected. This specific location is very convieniently located next to the Dumbarton By a ridge and the bay most especially. Both Phelix and Sarah were very nice and helpful when we needed to access multiple units. Their professionalism always relieved the stress during our moving projects. I will recommend them when I know anyone else has moving needs such as my family did. The storage rates I feel exactly match the local economy of the Bay Area!







I suddenly found myself in need of a storge unit. And many years ago I had used this very same facilty. The managers here are so pleasent. They mad my experience very comfertable from start to end. If your in need of a unit I would recommend you come here 1st hands town. The floors on the upper level are super clean and shinney 0. Also the grounds on the lower level andare paper free. They totally  strive for excellence 2 thumbs up to Renee ad her team. Keep up the good work and thank you very much for helping me







This is one of the worst storage facilities I've ever been to the wife of the manager is a very rude rude disrespectful unprofessional unbusinesslike person. I'm surprised extra storage lets this lady work for them. I have never been profiled in my life and this lady profiled my boyfriend and I which is unacceptable we are paying customers and the district manager doesn't really care. This lady will do this again to other people. People get storage units 4 reasons you should respect that person and be kind to the situation that they're going through that's not how it is at extra Space Storage you're judged and profiled and she's a very mean lady. I know other storage facilities taken into consideration what people are going through and why they even have to get a storage not this place I just don't recommend this place at all . All I needed was a storage unit for my things and all I've got is grief and its not fair in my life right now that I'm having to go through anything from this lady and speaking to the district manager nothing's going to get done about this lady this is how she is and its accepted by them.







We needed storage space for work and Felix made the whole process easy and efficient! The facility is conveniently located, clean and easy to navigate. We are pleased with our selection.







This facility is very well kept - however, Your items are not safe here!!.
If someone enters your unit, you will never know until you visit your unit and find out that your unit has been invaded. Felix and Renee knew someone entered my unit and did not make any effort to let me know. Yet they did put another lock on being mine was cut off...Um - maybe they could have made the attempt to call me before or after they put the lock on to let me know...Should I be grateful that they put a lock back on after being invaded with no form of contact?
Go figure- how safe is that... Common sense is free, especially when you live on the facility.. 
I moved my things a few days later.







A great place for storage.  Manager Felox Moya helped me with a kind, professional demeanor.  He cares about his customers.







A great place to store your stuff. The facilities are nice, clean, and large. The rates are affordable and beat out many competitors. Felix, the manager, also gave me a free lock when I bought my storage unit! I highly recommend Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park.







The owners were very nice and helpful in getting me into the right sized unit on short notice... Made my apartment move out very smooth! Thanks Felix and Renee!







I was a student looking for storage for the summer when I came across fliers advertising a discount introductory rate for All Aboard Mini Storage.  I decided to go with it because I would be saving $25 over a competing storage facility.  Do not be fooled by the discount.

I'm giving All Aboard Mini Storage a low rating because I ultimately ended up losing a lot more money than the discount saved and because their customer service was extremely bad compared with the previous storage facility I went with.

I was warned beforehand that I would have to give a 5-day notice before closing my storage space.  At the end of summer, I sent an email to them, giving my notification.  I received a personal confirmation from the manager that they had received my notification and that they appreciated doing business with me.  Two months later, I find that they were still charging me and now at full price.  When I contacted them about this mistake, they told me to refer back to the contract I had signed 5 months ago at section 7, where it stated that I would have to come in person to close my account.  At no point before that did they contact me about coming in to shut down the account and I was led to believe that the account had closed.  At no point did they apologise because they were afraid of liability if they did.

Basically, there is an expectation for YOU to follow up on closing your account, otherwise it is in their best interest to just keep charging without your knowledge.  I ended up wasting over $200 without my knowledge before I realised they were still charging me.  I did not get a refund despite the fact that I had nothing stored in the space for over two months.  I did not get an apology and instead was treated to a lecture about how I should always keep track of a contract during my summer vacation.  Students should stay away.







Felix is a great help. Made the move as easy as one could expect. 
He made a lot of cost saving suggestions and instead of selling me bubble wrap he just gave me some that a previous renter had left. He could have made an extra buck, but he put customer service first.







We went to Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park today after reserving a storage unit for our son, who recently graduated.  Felix, the manager, and his wife were extremely helpful and pleasant.  They explained everything to us and were very professional.  The storage unit we rented was clean and spacious.  They answered all of our questions.  Our son was shown how to get in and out of the facility and we were taken to his individual storage unit by golf cart so that we did not initially have to walk far. We felt that the facility was very secure and we were very happy with the service.  Felix and his wife were terrific!







Great and very helpful managers at this facility. Very eager to assist with any and all concerns. Clean well managed facility. Only negative is exiting facility right turn only so have to go aways in traffic to turn around.







Felix and Renee Moya are the best. They helped my wife and I solve our storage problems in one visit. They are not only good business people but good people people (and I meant to repeat the word people!). The facility is spotless, easily accessible, and super convenient. I highly recommend All Aboard and encourage you to talk to Felix and Renee about your storage issues- I bet they can help.







Very friendly and helpful staff.  And flexible.  I had an item delivered that was too large for my unit. They switched me to a suitable unit immediately.  I recommend them to anyone.







For a good storage space at an excellent rate, and with a great staff, this place's it. Always has been the best deal in town!







I have been with this storage place for many years now and have had to deal with unsavory management, which I felt highly reflected the sterile company ideal itself. Nearly every place has security cameras and the like but it's the service that makes the difference. However now that the Moyas are managing it everything has changed. These two have brought back the old time know your customers, treat them with respect and always be there if they need you. All Aboard is SO lucky to have them. I was ready to move and plan on staying now. I hope All Aboard appreciates who they have because the Moyas have put me at peace and bent over backwards to help. You know you and your things will be taken care of if you rent here simply because the management cares now. Thank you for all that you have done Mr. and Mrs. Moya. Blessings!

Ray was amazing! After a comprehensive search of Bay Area, peninsula area storage facilities, I just opened a rental unit here at this location and the service was the best I've experienced at any business.  I feel confident that my things will be safe here, especially due to the on-site, live-in manager.  They are having a great move-in deal and I received half off the first month's rent.  Ray is the manager on duty currently.  He's normally the manager at the Redwood City location, but is here while the new manager of Menlo Park gets settled in.   Thanks for storing my stuff!

This place is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! The place is infested with rats and the staff will not do anything about it!  We have spoken with staff and informed them of the situation and informed them of how much stuff was damaged.  They will not reimburse or pay for professional cleaning.  Beware!!! Do not use them unless you want your belongings ruined by rat droppings, urine and nesting in your furniture! Terrible customer service!! We used three different storage rooms and all three have had rat droppings!!

Recently rented a storage unit from Felix at Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park.  He and his wife are very friendly and professional.  They keep the facility very clean which I appreciate. They called me to confirm our appointment time before arrival and when I arrived Felix drove me around the facility to show me all the available options for storage unit locations so that I felt comfortable with the distance from the gate.  They also made a follow up call to make sure I was happy with the facility and my storage unit.  I would highly recommend this facility.  It is clean, convenient, and the rental prices are very competitive.

My family kept our belongings here for over a year. We rested well knowing that things would be secured and protected. This specific location is very convieniently located next to the Dumbarton By a ridge and the bay most especially. Both Phelix and Sarah were very nice and helpful when we needed to access multiple units. Their professionalism always relieved the stress during our moving projects. I will recommend them when I know anyone else has moving needs such as my family did. The storage rates I feel exactly match the local economy of the Bay Area!

This is one of the worst storage facilities I've ever been to the wife of the manager is a very rude rude disrespectful unprofessional unbusinesslike person. I'm surprised extra storage lets this lady work for them. I have never been profiled in my life and this lady profiled my boyfriend and I which is unacceptable we are paying customers and the district manager doesn't really care. This lady will do this again to other people. People get storage units 4 reasons you should respect that person and be kind to the situation that they're going through that's not how it is at extra Space Storage you're judged and profiled and she's a very mean lady. I know other storage facilities taken into consideration what people are going through and why they even have to get a storage not this place I just don't recommend this place at all . All I needed was a storage unit for my things and all I've got is grief and its not fair in my life right now that I'm having to go through anything from this lady and speaking to the district manager nothing's going to get done about this lady this is how she is and its accepted by them.

This facility is very well kept - however, Your items are not safe here!!.If someone enters your unit, you will never know until you visit your unit and find out that your unit has been invaded. Felix and Renee knew someone entered my unit and did not make any effort to let me know. Yet they did put another lock on being mine was cut off...Um - maybe they could have made the attempt to call me before or after they put the lock on to let me know...Should I be grateful that they put a lock back on after being invaded with no form of contact?Go figure- how safe is that... Common sense is free, especially when you live on the facility.. I moved my things a few days later.

I was a student looking for storage for the summer when I came across fliers advertising a discount introductory rate for All Aboard Mini Storage.  I decided to go with it because I would be saving $25 over a competing storage facility.  Do not be fooled by the discount.I'm giving All Aboard Mini Storage a low rating because I ultimately ended up losing a lot more money than the discount saved and because their customer service was extremely bad compared with the previous storage facility I went with.I was warned beforehand that I would have to give a 5-day notice before closing my storage space.  At the end of summer, I sent an email to them, giving my notification.  I received a personal confirmation from the manager that they had received my notification and that they appreciated doing business with me.  Two months later, I find that they were still charging me and now at full price.  When I contacted them about this mistake, they told me to refer back to the contract I had signed 5 months ago at section 7, where it stated that I would have to come in person to close my account.  At no point before that did they contact me about coming in to shut down the account and I was led to believe that the account had closed.  At no point did they apologise because they were afraid of liability if they did.Basically, there is an expectation for YOU to follow up on closing your account, otherwise it is in their best interest to just keep charging without your knowledge.  I ended up wasting over $200 without my knowledge before I realised they were still charging me.  I did not get a refund despite the fact that I had nothing stored in the space for over two months.  I did not get an apology and instead was treated to a lecture about how I should always keep track of a contract during my summer vacation.  Students should stay away.

We went to Extra Space Storage in Menlo Park today after reserving a storage unit for our son, who recently graduated.  Felix, the manager, and his wife were extremely helpful and pleasant.  They explained everything to us and were very professional.  The storage unit we rented was clean and spacious.  They answered all of our questions.  Our son was shown how to get in and out of the facility and we were taken to his individual storage unit by golf cart so that we did not initially have to walk far. We felt that the facility was very secure and we were very happy with the service.  Felix and his wife were terrific!

Very friendly and helpful staff.  And flexible.  I had an item delivered that was too large for my unit. They switched me to a suitable unit immediately.  I recommend them to anyone.

I have been with this storage place for many years now and have had to deal with unsavory management, which I felt highly reflected the sterile company ideal itself. Nearly every place has security cameras and the like but it's the service that makes the difference. However now that the Moyas are managing it everything has changed. These two have brought back the old time know your customers, treat them with respect and always be there if they need you. All Aboard is SO lucky to have them. I was ready to move and plan on staying now. I hope All Aboard appreciates who they have because the Moyas have put me at peace and bent over backwards to help. You know you and your things will be taken care of if you rent here simply because the management cares now. Thank you for all that you have done Mr. and Mrs. Moya. Blessings!

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

Terrific move in experience. Clean, secure, and courteous. The owners actually work in the office and were great. I am quite happy to have chosen this storage facility site unseen. I was even able to check in to my California rental and gain my access code from a franchise in NJ - in order to save time and enable moving in after office hours.

History[edit]
Extra Space Storage, the publicly traded REIT launched on the NYSE under the symbol "EXR" in August 2004 is the successor to Extra Space Development Co., a Limited Partnership which was founded in 1979 by Kenneth M.Woolley as General Partner, Neilson Enterprises as Limited Partner, and with Richard S. Tanner joining Woolley as an additional General Partner shortly after its creation. Prior to creating Extra Space Development Woolley and Tanner had worked together in another real estate venture in 1975,and Woolley had built his first self-storage facility in Billings, Montana in 1977 with Bill Nielson of Nielson Enterprises. Between 1979 and 2004, Woolley and Tanner developed self-storage properties in California, Utah, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Tanner served as President of the affiliated Extra Space Management Co. for 15 years which managed owned and third party self-storage properties. Both Woolley and Tanner served as licensed Real Estate Brokers in multiple states which facilitated third party management and several acquisitions of existing storage properties. Over the years, several of the self-storage properties developed by Extra Space Development were sold to Public Storage or Storage USA, and Storage USA was acquired by Extra Space Storage shortly after going public.
Before going public, Extra Space Development created several joint ventures partnerships including with Prudential Real Estate and in 1998, eventual CEO Spencer Kirk joined Woolley as a 50-50 partner for many new properties being developed or acquired. .[2] Kirk was previously the co-founder of Megahertz, a laptop modem company that was purchased by USRobotics in 1994, and later by 3Com.[5]
In August, 2004, Extra Space held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol "EXR", opening at $12.50 per share.[4]
In 2005, as part of a joint venture with Prudential Real Estate, Extra Space acquired Storage USA for $2.3 Billion,[6] adding 458 additional properties. With Woolley as CEO and Tanner as its SVP of Construction and Development, Extra Space Storage continued growth through developments exceeding $100M/yr, combined with additional acquisitions of existing properties and expansion of its 3rd party management contracts. With the economic changes of 2008 that especially impacted commercial real estate financing and construction, development and construction was wound down by 2010 and Extra Space focused growth efforts on selective acquisitions and third party management of properties under the Extra Space Storage brand.[7]
Facilities[edit]
As of August, 2014, Extra Space Storage owns and operates 1,106 facilities in the US.[2] The company's properties comprise approximately 740,000 units, and over 81 million square feet of rentable storage space.[8][9] Various types of storage units are offered by the company, including RV, boat, and automobile storage. The company also offers climate-controlled units, indoor and outdoor units, and locker units.

Extra Space Storage Becomes #22 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Mallinckrodt
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 03/31/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

History[edit]
Extra Space Storage, the publicly traded REIT launched on the NYSE under the symbol "EXR" in August 2004 is the successor to Extra Space Development Co., a Limited Partnership which was founded in 1979 by Kenneth M.Woolley as General Partner, Neilson Enterprises as Limited Partner, and with Richard S. Tanner joining Woolley as an additional General Partner shortly after its creation. Prior to creating Extra Space Development Woolley and Tanner had worked together in another real estate venture in 1975,and Woolley had built his first self-storage facility in Billings, Montana in 1977 with Bill Nielson of Nielson Enterprises. Between 1979 and 2004, Woolley and Tanner developed self-storage properties in California, Utah, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Tanner served as President of the affiliated Extra Space Management Co. for 15 years which managed owned and third party self-storage properties. Both Woolley and Tanner served as licensed Real Estate Brokers in multiple states which facilitated third party management and several acquisitions of existing storage properties. Over the years, several of the self-storage properties developed by Extra Space Development were sold to Public Storage or Storage USA, and Storage USA was acquired by Extra Space Storage shortly after going public.
Before going public, Extra Space Development created several joint ventures partnerships including with Prudential Real Estate and in 1998, eventual CEO Spencer Kirk joined Woolley as a 50-50 partner for many new properties being developed or acquired. .[2] Kirk was previously the co-founder of Megahertz, a laptop modem company that was purchased by USRobotics in 1994, and later by 3Com.[5]
In August, 2004, Extra Space held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol "EXR", opening at $12.50 per share.[4]
In 2005, as part of a joint venture with Prudential Real Estate, Extra Space acquired Storage USA for $2.3 Billion,[6] adding 458 additional properties. With Woolley as CEO and Tanner as its SVP of Construction and Development, Extra Space Storage continued growth through developments exceeding $100M/yr, combined with additional acquisitions of existing properties and expansion of its 3rd party management contracts. With the economic changes of 2008 that especially impacted commercial real estate financing and construction, development and construction was wound down by 2010 and Extra Space focused growth efforts on selective acquisitions and third party management of properties under the Extra Space Storage brand.[7]
Facilities[edit]
As of August, 2014, Extra Space Storage owns and operates 1,106 facilities in the US.[2] The company's properties comprise approximately 740,000 units, and over 81 million square feet of rentable storage space.[8][9] Various types of storage units are offered by the company, including RV, boat, and automobile storage. The company also offers climate-controlled units, indoor and outdoor units, and locker units.

Over the years, several of the self-storage properties developed by Extra Space Development were sold to Public Storage or Storage USA, and Storage USA was acquired by Extra Space Storage shortly after going public.
Before going public, Extra Space Development created several joint ventures partnerships including with Prudential Real Estate and in 1998, eventual CEO Spencer Kirk joined Woolley as a 50-50 partner for many new properties being developed or acquired. .[2] Kirk was previously the co-founder of Megahertz, a laptop modem company that was purchased by USRobotics in 1994, and later by 3Com.[5]
In August, 2004, Extra Space held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol "EXR", opening at $12.50 per share.[4]
In 2005, as part of a joint venture with Prudential Real Estate, Extra Space acquired Storage USA for $2.3 Billion,[6] adding 458 additional properties. With Woolley as CEO and Tanner as its SVP of Construction and Development, Extra Space Storage continued growth through developments exceeding $100M/yr, combined with additional acquisitions of existing properties and expansion of its 3rd party management contracts. With the economic changes of 2008 that especially impacted commercial real estate financing and construction, development and construction was wound down by 2010 and Extra Space focused growth efforts on selective acquisitions and third party management of properties under the Extra Space Storage brand.[7]
Facilities[edit]
As of August, 2014, Extra Space Storage owns and operates 1,106 facilities in the US.[2] The company's properties comprise approximately 740,000 units, and over 81 million square feet of rentable storage space.[8][9] Various types of storage units are offered by the company, including RV, boat, and automobile storage. The company also offers climate-controlled units, indoor and outdoor units, and locker units.

Prior to creating Extra Space Development Woolley and Tanner had worked together in another real estate venture in 1975,and Woolley had built his first self-storage facility in Billings, Montana in 1977 with Bill Nielson of Nielson Enterprises. Between 1979 and 2004, Woolley and Tanner developed self-storage properties in California, Utah, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Tanner served as President of the affiliated Extra Space Management Co. for 15 years which managed owned and third party self-storage properties. Both Woolley and Tanner served as licensed Real Estate Brokers in multiple states which facilitated third party management and several acquisitions of existing storage properties. Over the years, several of the self-storage properties developed by Extra Space Development were sold to Public Storage or Storage USA, and Storage USA was acquired by Extra Space Storage shortly after going public.
Before going public, Extra Space Development created several joint ventures partnerships including with Prudential Real Estate and in 1998, eventual CEO Spencer Kirk joined Woolley as a 50-50 partner for many new properties being developed or acquired. .[2] Kirk was previously the co-founder of Megahertz, a laptop modem company that was purchased by USRobotics in 1994, and later by 3Com.[5]
In August, 2004, Extra Space held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol "EXR", opening at $12.50 per share.[4]
In 2005, as part of a joint venture with Prudential Real Estate, Extra Space acquired Storage USA for $2.3 Billion,[6] adding 458 additional properties. With Woolley as CEO and Tanner as its SVP of Construction and Development, Extra Space Storage continued growth through developments exceeding $100M/yr, combined with additional acquisitions of existing properties and expansion of its 3rd party management contracts.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
