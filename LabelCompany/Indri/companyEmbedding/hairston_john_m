John M. Hairston, Jr. was named as acting Assistant Administrator for the Office of Education by NASA Deputy Administrator Shana Dale on June 2, 2006. Hairston succeeds Angela Phillips Diaz. Diaz recently became the new Director of Strategic Communications and Development for the Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. 

In this new role, Hairston is responsible for providing executive leadership to the Office of Education. He ensures policy direction, functional management and guidance in coordinating the agency's overall efforts to organize and enhance its education programs. 

Hairston was the director of the External Programs Directorate at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. He was appointed to this position in June 1991. As director, Hairston was responsible for the development and implementation of NASA's educational outreach and informational programs that strengthen public awareness and contribute to the agency's scientific goals and missions. Furthermore, he was responsible for the development and implementation of outreach, educational and informational programs that contribute to scientific literacy and strengthen awareness and participation of target groups in NASA Glenn’s mission and vision. 

Before joining NASA Glenn, Hairston spent 27 years with the Cleveland Municipal School System. He held a series of responsible positions, including English teacher, Special Project Center Director, Assistant Education Program Manager, Staff Development Director and Chief of the Community Relations Department. 

Hairston earned a Bachelor of Science in English from Bluefield State College in Bluefield, W.Va., and has a master's degree in Educational Administration from Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio. His studies also include courses at John F. Kennedy’s School of Public Policy, Kent State University, and Case Western Reserve University.
