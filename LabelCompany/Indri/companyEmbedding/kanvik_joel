Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (BKEP) has named Joel Kanvik as general counsel replacing Chris Paul after his three years of service.
Joel Kanvik will serve as general counsel for the partnership and brings more than 20 years of experience to the organization, including 15 years at Enbridge Energy Company, Inc., a transporter of crude oil and natural gas via pipeline.
“Joel brings more than two decades of legal experience and expertise in a wide range of practice areas including an extensive background in domestic and international legal affairs, business and environmental to his position as general counsel, as well as an in-depth transactional experience that will be vital as Blueknight considers the prospect of future growth through acquisitions,” said Mark Hurley, CEO of BKEP. 
“His knowledge of large-scale international projects, acquisitions both domestic and international and litigation management in the midstream sector gives him a deep legal understanding of our business operations. Joel’s leadership and insight as an effective negotiator to secure agreements and drive solutions will be invaluable as we continue to grow and expand our operations to ensure long-term growth and drive shareholder value,” added Hurley.
Kanvik has experience in corporate law as well as private practice. He most recently served as the director – U.S. Law and assistant secretary for Enbridge Energy Company, Inc. in Duluth, Minn. He provided legal and business counsel to a family of corporations/limited partnerships, including the development and execution for large-scale construction/acquisition projects, mergers and acquisitions, contracts and licenses, intellectual property, litigation management and corporate governance. He developed and managed up to seven attorneys and five staff members while at Enbridge. Prior to that, he was in a private practice at LaRowe, Gerlach & Roy, S.C., in Madison, Wisc. Kanvik received a B.A. in political science from Northwestern University and a J.D. from University of Wisconsin Law School and he is a member of the State of Wisconsin Bar Association.
“I am pleased to join Blueknight and work with Mark and team to build on the company’s robust portfolio and continue the momentum in place as we drive our high-value projects and execute our business strategy. I have the utmost respect for the organization’s leadership in the industry and our shared value of operating with integrity,” said Joel Kanvik, general counsel at BKEP.
