Lee Equity Partners co-launches new fertility company Prelude


October 17, 2016
By Iris Dorbian






Lee Equity Partners, serial entrepreneur Martín Varsavsky, Reproductive Biology Associates and My Egg Bank North America have formed Prelude, a new fertility company that helps people better control their biological clocks. According to a statement about the launch, Lee Equity Partners and Varsavsky have committed up to $200 million in equity funding for the fertility sector, a portion of which financed the launch and partnership with RBA and MEB.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK (October 17, 2016)—Today, Lee Equity Partners, serial entrepreneur Martín Varsavsky, Reproductive Biology Associates (RBA), and My Egg Bank North America (MEB) launched Prelude, a comprehensive fertility company focused on providing proactive fertility care to improve people’s chances of having healthy babies when they’re ready. With more people delaying childbirth until their 30s and 40s to complete their education, pursue careers or find the right partner, Prelude aims to give people more reproductive choices and control over their biological clocks using The Prelude Method. The Prelude Method is a four-step process that includes egg and sperm freezing, genetic testing, embryo creation and single-embryo transfer. Currently, around 18% of women never get to have a baby, and another 20% have just one baby when they wanted more. By coupling earlier decision making with the latest reproductive science and technology, The Prelude Method can dramatically increase the probability of having a healthy baby and decrease the chances of requiring infertility therapy later in life. 





Prelude has teamed with fertility industry leaders and clinical experts Reproductive Biology Associates (RBA) in Atlanta, and My Egg Bank North America. RBA is led by reproductive endocrinologists Andrew A. Toledo, M.D., Daniel B. Shapiro, M.D., and Zsolt Peter Nagy, PhD (embryology). Dr. Nagy and his team most recently contributed to significant improvements in oocyte cryopreservation using vitrification technology, which led to the establishment of the first highly efficient donor egg cryobank in the United States, My Egg Bank North America. Dr. Nagy was also employed as a medical scientist on the team that first developed intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a novel insemination method now utilized worldwide.
“Prelude is using vitrification and genetic testing of embryos to dramatically improve pregnancy outcomes,” said Nagy. “The Prelude Method helps us advance My Egg Bank’s mission to ensure people achieve their parenting dreams by literally freezing their fertility at its prime, instead of having to solve the issue of infertility later in life.”
The Prelude Method, Explained
The Prelude Method is a four-step process:
1. Fertility Preservation
Women’s eggs and men’s sperm are frozen during their peak fertility years—their 20s and early 30s. Contrary to popular belief, it’s not just women’s eggs that carry risks associated with declining fertility. Advancing paternal age also has been associated with higher incidence of illnesses in offspring such as autism and bipolar disorder. 





2. Embryo Creation
When clients are ready to start a family, eggs and sperm are unfrozen and combined to create embryos.
3. Genetic Screening
Before the embryo is implanted, parents are screened for common inherited diseases. If the results of this testing indicate increased risk to their offspring, the embryos are tested for the specific disease(s). Embryos are also tested for chromosomal abnormalities. As genetic screening improves, the number of illnesses that can be detected will rise over time, and so will the chances of having a healthy baby.
4. Single Embryo Transfer
An embryo is selected that will maximize the likelihood for a healthy birth.
“When my wife Nina was only 31, her AMH level was prematurely low and her cycles were irregular,” said Varsavsky. “Being a tech entrepreneur, I started researching her condition, and we decided to go straight for IVF as well as freeze sperm and eggs. We also added the most advanced genetic testing to the mix. The result was phenomenal, we now have two wonderful kids, Mia, 5, and David, 3, and a third one on the way. A fourth baby was born out of our own difficulties—Prelude!”
The WHO Ranks Infertility the Third Most Serious Disease Worldwide
Today, as many as one-third of couples fail trying to conceive through sex, and according to the March of Dimes, as many as 15% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, with the rate increasing as a woman ages. The World Health Organization ranks infertility as the third most serious disease worldwide, after cancer and cardiovascular disease. Inside of this crisis, infertility is estimated to be more than a $2 billion industry, growing more than 4% annually. This trend is dominated by people over the age of 35, who—due to career, financial pressures, not finding the right partner or other factors—are now struggling to conceive. Those who do conceive at a later age have offspring that face significant health risks: 80% of embryos from women over 40 years old carry chromosomal abnormalities, and 5% of newborns are affected by genetic conditions. By providing men and women with more information and choices for managing their fertility earlier in their reproductive years, Prelude intends to significantly reduce the emotional stress and high cost associated with dealing with infertility later in life. 





As Prelude’s CEO and founder, Varsavsky will oversee efforts to expand the company’s clinical reach. Geoff Crouse, a senior executive with extensive experience building successful companies in both life sciences and consumer healthcare, will serve as a board member and will support launching Prelude as the interim president. Crouse most recently was the CEO of Cord Blood Registry, the world’s largest private cord blood and tissue bank. Varsavsky and Crouse will be joined on the Prelude board of directors by Dr. Mehmet Oz, who reaches millions through his internationally syndicated media platforms, including the eight-time Daytime Emmy Award–winning TV program The Dr. Oz Show. Dr. Oz has authored more than 400 publications, book chapters and medical books, and has received numerous patents. He participates in 50 heart surgeries per year and is a professor of surgery at Columbia University.
With investments in leading health businesses, including Eating Recovery Center—the nation’s largest network of eating disorder clinics—Lee Equity Partners joined forces with Varsavsky, committing up to $200 million in equity to support the fertility industry and positively impact the lives of many future parents. A portion has funded the acquisition and partnership with RBA and My Egg Bank.
Barry Baker, a senior advisor to Lee Equity, said, “Martín, Geoff and Dr. Oz, and the outstanding physicians at MEB and RBA, create a dream team to transform the fertility industry through premier medicine and broader adoption of vitrification services.” 





Collins Ward, a principal at Lee Equity, added, “The combined resources and leadership at Prelude provide a powerful mix of medical innovation and marketing expertise that will drive consumer education and enable millions of people to plan and grow their families.”

Lee Equity Partners is a private equity firm focused on growth capital investments in middle-market companies across a range of industries.
The firm, which is based in New York City, was founded in 2006 by Thomas H. Lee, the notable private equity investor who previously founded Thomas H. Lee Partners and also owns the Blue Star group of fund of hedge funds.[1][2][3]
History[edit]
In March 2006, Thomas H. Lee resigned from Thomas H. Lee Partners as the firm was nearing completion of fundraising for its sixth and current private equity fund. In the same year, Lee formed Lee Equity Partners a private equity firm focused on the same leveraged buyout transactions that he had been completing for nearly 35 years at THL.[4][5][6]
Both Lee and THL insisted that move was amicable, however persistent reports suggested that Lee, who had limited his day-to-day involvement in the firm and had relocated to New York City had been pushed out by several partners.[7]
Among the first professionals to join Lee Equity Partners included Mark Gormley, a founding partner of Capital Z Partners; David Morrison, former president and CEO of Mercer Management Consulting and Allen Questrom, former CEO of J.C. Penney Company, Barneys New York, Federated Department Stores and Neiman Marcus. The firm also brought in former investment professionals from Bain Capital and The Carlyle Group.[8]
Among the firm's first investments included the acquisition of Deb Shops in 2007.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
