Job Details
               The Deltennium Group is committed to expanding the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviors of all Leaders responsible for achieving organizational peak performance. We focus on every level of leadership, from the lowest to the highest levels of an organization. More than 90% of leaders are employed at the first level of an organization, and are essentially "Work Leaders" because of their dual roles. They are both workers, doing the technical work of their unit and leaders who guide the success of their units' performance. The Work Leaders are often the core of an organization's leadership and they are responsible for the real work of an organization. We believe that the successful Work Leaders must be leaders first, managers second and technical workers third. The success of a work unit is dependent upon the Work Leader effectively leading the unit's associates. At the other extreme in the organization, we focus on supporting senior executives and boards of directors in their responsibilities for organizational governance. We work with boards of directors to assure that they are all exercising their director and oversight responsibilities to the best interest of all the stakeholders, and acting in compliance with the letter and spirit of Sarbanes-Oxley. We work with senior executives to help them develop and organize their strategies and create organizational structures and policies which help them effectively lead all their associates to achieve peak performance. Our organization is committed to Consulting - Training - Speaking - Research - Investing as the vehicles to help leaders and organizations achieve peak performance. We have a broad range of activities and tools which we use to help organizations and individuals achieve success. A few of these are books, newsletters, seminars, coaching, mentoring, journal articles, webinars, keynotes and a broad range of pro bono activities which provide us the opportunity to give back to the community. In addition, we have a commitment to continued research on leadership issues and are also frequently willing to make financial investments in start-ups and early stage ventures that we believe have an ability to achieve peak performance. Deltennium offers a complete range of consulting services to assist companies in the creation, implementation and maintenance of compensation programs that help attract, retain, motivate and reward the executives, directors, and employees that assist companies of all sizes and stages of development in successfully competing in the global marketplace. Our program is designed to convert executive compensation into a performance-based vehicle for increasing economic and shareholder value, as well as to ameliorate existing programs employing time-tested optimization methods and industry-specific data. We believe that developing a strategy to align executive compensation plans with realistic business goals and objectives is a critical first step for any competing business organization. Our consultants will assist you in developing the fundamentals of a compensation plan that include market comparisons, internal alignment, salary adjustments, and job descriptions. The compensation of executives is especially critical due to the direct impact their governance has on organizational success. The relationship between performance and compensation is of increasing importance to all facets of business, and our consultants are trained to implement decades of experience in creating specially designed incentive and compensation plans with the goal of producing myriad benefits for executive employees and their organizations. Deltennium provides support to your company's Compensation Committee and management in addressing all matters of executive compensation. We specialize in competitive analysis and plan design; salaries; incentive compensation, strategy setting; equity programs; and employment agreements. Our expertise lies in the utilization of current and reliable research data and time-tested principles to create custom solutions for your company's foremost compensation and business challenges with the goal of producing creative and effective compensation strategies that adhere to current trends. Our executive compensation consultants are available to develop a strategy that is customized to your organizational requirements. We firmly believe that properly conceived executive compensation plans are a critical component of success for all levels and types of business. By recognizing proven cornerstones for profitability and productivity, we aid our clients in creating and administering incentive and compensation programs that will provide substantial benefits for both employees and organizations. By doing so, we hope to enable the success of your business for years to come.
