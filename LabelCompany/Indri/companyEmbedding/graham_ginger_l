Bio: Ginger L. Graham



January 9, 2006, 12:00 AM EST









         
      
      
                
          
          
          
          
          
      
      
               Throughout her life, Graham has demonstrated a theatrical flair and a persistence in the face of tough challenges
BORN
Nov. 18, 1955, in Springdale, Ark.








POSITION
CEO of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which recently launched two drugs to treat diabetes.
EDUCATION




BS in Agricultural Economics, University of Arkansas, 1979; MBA, Harvard, 1986.
FIRST JOB




Arkansas State Rodeo Queen.
HOW BEING A FARMGIRL PREPARED HER TO BE CEO
"We had to grow what we ate, and we took care of animals that were dependent on us. I learned pretty quickly that there are things bigger than me -- the seasons, life and death, and disappointments. As a kid, that teaches you to work hard and be resourceful."
BIGGEST DEAL
As an executive at Eli Lilly & Co., she brokered the 1987 sale of its Elizabeth Arden unit to Fabergé for $735 million -- then the largest sale ever of a cosmetics company.
FAMILY
Married to insurance executive John since 1998, three grown stepchildren.




Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
