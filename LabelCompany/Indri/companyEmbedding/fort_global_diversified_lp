SummaryGlobal Diversified has evolved since FORT’s inception in 1993. Originally composed entirely of the Trend strategy, Contrarian was added as approximately 50% of the portfolio in 2002. In 2009, Short-Term Mean Reversion was added as approximately 10% (Contrarian and Trend both approximately 45%), and in August, 2014, Equity Market Neutral was added. The Equity Market Neutral strategy was traded with proprietary capital for 5 ½ years before being added to Global Diversified.  Currently, Global Diversified is made up of approximately 29% Trend, 29% Contrarian, 9% Short-Term Mean Reversion, and 33% Equity Market Neutral. Investment StrategyThis product is a combination of the four strategies that the firm has ever developed and they are uncorrelated to each other and the equity markets.  There are 3 futures strategies (trend, Contrarian, and short term mean reversion) and an equity market neutral strategy.Risk ManagementThe model employs the Bayesian process of shifting risk from underperforming to outperforming asset classes.  The four underlying strategies have little correlation and individual contract exposure is capped.  The maximum marging to equity it 12% but the average is around 7-9%.

Leadership








Yves Balcer
read bio


Dr. Yves Balcer co-founded FORT in 1993. Before founding FORT, Yves was a Senior Manager of Investment at the World Bank. During his final two years at the World Bank, he directed the research and implementation of system-based trading strategies in the global bond markets. During his tenure at the World Bank Yves served, at various times, as Senior Manager for the North American, European and Asian portfolios, where he managed teams of professional traders overseeing over $25 billion in fixed-income assets.
Yves holds a PhD in Economics and Finance from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a PhD in Operations Research, a MS in Statistics from Stanford University, and a MS in Mathematics from the Université de Montréal in Canada.
Yves was a Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin and has authored more than twenty-five articles on finance and economics published in professional journals.









Sanjiv Kumar
read bio


Dr. Sanjiv Kumar co-founded FORT in 1993. Before founding FORT, Sanjiv served as a Senior Manager of Investment at the World Bank. During his tenure at the World Bank, Sanjiv managed large fixed-income portfolios in all the major currencies. At the time of his departure, he was responsible for investing $10 billion in US and Canadian dollar securities.
Prior to joining the World Bank, Sanjiv was Vice President of Free Market Inc., a Chicago-based economic and financial advisory firm for institutional money managers.
Sanjiv holds a PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago and a BA in Mathematics from the University of Delhi in India.







Our History

Exploration
Yves Balcer and Sanjiv Kumar, FORT’s co-founders, have extensive academic training with 3 PhDs and 4 Masters degrees between them, spanning disciplines from economics and mathematics to statistics and operations research. Yves, followed by Sanjiv, led the Investment Division of the World Bank as Senior Managers, overseeing the investment team tasked with managing the bank’s largest portfolio.
FORT was founded upon a simple premise: statistical approaches improve human decision-making.




While the experience of managing a $20 billion portfolio was invaluable, we felt that practical experience alone was not enough. Human intuition should be combined with statistical expertise in order to produce systematic strategies. We founded FORT with this mission.
Yves
We wanted to test our theories in the real world. No matter how confident we might be in our research, there is no substitute for actual implementation. Founding FORT was that step.
Sanjiv



Development
In 1993, with the support of their families, Yves and Sanjiv launched FORT. They immediately faced the challenge of building a hedge fund from the ground up. Operational infrastructure is as important to clients as investment performance. Without the benefit of the World Bank’s infrastructure to support them, Yves and Sanjiv did what had always come naturally to them and what has become a hallmark of FORT’s ethos – they built what they needed. While large firms had the resources to hire personnel to assist with trade reconciliation, allocation, accounting, and other middle- and back-office functions, Yves and Sanjiv built automated solutions to ensure they could compete. As the firm’s reputation and resources grew, Yves and Sanjiv invested in human capital: employees with skills and experience essential to help them further their vision.




Managing institutional assets requires a strong, cutting edge infrastructure. We have invested consistently in FORT’s human capital, systems, and processes to maintain the highest standards. We have steadily developed differentiated strategies that are designed to generate attractive returns over a wide range of market conditions.
Sanjiv



Growth
Today FORT’s team has grown to over 40 professionals located in Washington, D.C., and New York. The investment team led by Yves and Sanjiv has developed numerous systematic investment strategies in both futures and equity markets, using fundamental and technical analysis. These investment strategies are accessed by institutional investors of all types across the globe. Although the team is larger now, the core values of the firm still remain: an entrepreneurial spirit, a dedication to clients, and an innovative approach to investment management.




It is our desire to build for the next generation. Sanjiv and I are excited about the future of FORT and we look forward to the continued development of innovative investment solutions.
Yves




 
 




Our Methodology







































                        menu
                                








 




Methodology
We believe that factors influencing human discretionary decision-making lead to persistent market opportunities for systematic trading strategies. Humans generally have a difficult time analyzing large amounts of data effectively and dispassionately. Human decision-making is strongly influenced by two factors: the most recent experiences and the most adverse. When under stress, humans become irrational and overly risk-averse, missing opportunities for future gains.
These behavioral biases create opportunity for systematic trading models, especially those that are designed to adapt to changes in human behavior.





approach
research




Our Approach
We design our trading models to be systematic, adaptive, unique, and robust.




Systematic
FORT exclusively designs fully systematic strategies that seek to generate attractive risk adjusted returns over market cycles. FORT relies on its deep experience in the markets and expertise in statistics and mathematics to develop quantitative strategies. All FORT strategies are built to systematically adjust to key factors over time as the world and markets change.



Unique
FORT has a history of approaching complex opportunities from a different perspective. The founders' combination of significant market experience and advanced academic training in economics, statistics, and mathematics has spurred the generation of novel ideas and strategies. FORT's culture celebrates creative research endeavors.



Adaptive
Adaptability is inherent in all of FORT’s strategies. The models shift key factors over time as markets develop and evolve. FORT’s dynamic risk allocation methodology serves as a systematic way to attack the challenge of changing market dynamics faced by all systematic methods. This proprietary methodology continuously shifts the allocation of risk in the strategies to markets and indicators according to a forecast of risk-adjusted profitability.



Robust
Robustness is an essential component of any systematic strategy. FORT has consistently developed models that are focused on the future as opposed to fitting the past. FORT’s focus on statistically robust strategies has resulted in durability of the models over time. FORT seeks to develop strategies that perform with a high degree of stability over time, even in the face of extreme market dynamics.







Research

FORT’s research has always focused on developing strategies that trade liquid products, are uncorrelated to broader equity indices, are fully systematic, are relatively parameter free so as to be robust and adaptable to different market environments, and are uncorrelated to existing FORT strategies.
 
FORT has a disciplined and structured approach to research, first identifying unique opportunities, then developing strategies to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns around those opportunities. This is accomplished by leveraging FORT’s historical expertise in the application of statistical analysis to complex market structures. Throughout the process there is consistent and robust out-of-sample testing. Individual strategies can take years to develop and perfect before FORT will initiate live trading of the strategy with either proprietary or client capital.




Collaborative
We use a hub-and-spoke model: research ideas are pursued independently, but collectively refined. All members of the staff are encouraged to investigate research opportunities.



Rigorous
Once established as potentially viable, research ideas are rigorously vetted. Back-testing is thorough and verified by independent staff members. Research ideas must be systemized.



Focused
Research is aimed at finding strategies that are uncorrelated with FORT’s existing strategies, as well as broader market indices. We seek intuitive, statistically robust ideas that are likely to persist.





We believe what makes FORT unique is that we do not generally tinker with our models once they are complete. We build them to be self-adaptive in a systematic way and we allow them the freedom to do that. Our research is focused on creating models that complement our existing strategies. This is how our trading systems are designed to evolve: the addition of complementary approaches, rather than by intervening with what’s established.
Yves Balcer
