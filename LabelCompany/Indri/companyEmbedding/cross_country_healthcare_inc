Investor Relations



	We are a leader in healthcare staffing with a primary focus on providing nurse and allied and physician (locum tenens) staffing services and workforce solutions to the healthcare market. We believe we are one of the top two providers of nurse and allied staffing services, one of the top four providers of temporary physician staffing (locum tenens) services, and one of the top five providers of retained physician and healthcare executive search services. We report our financial results according to three business segments: (1) nurse and allied staffing, (2) physician staffing, and (3) other human capital management services. In February 2013, we sold our clinical trial services business.
	On a company-wide basis, we have approximately 4,000 contracts with hospitals and healthcare facilities, and other healthcare organizations to provide our staffing services and workforce solutions. No single client accounts for more than 4% of our revenue. Our fees are paid directly by our clients and in certain cases by third-party vendor managers. As a result, we have no direct exposure to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/15/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,144,688 share decrease in total short interest for Cross Country Healthcare Inc , to 1,304,245, a decrease of 46.74% since 05/31/2017.

How do I Buy Health Insurance?
For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
Now that the Affordable Care Act (sometimes referred to as "Obamacare") is in place, it is much easier to find a health insurance plan based on your income and personal health needs. In most states, you may even qualify for financial subsidies. You can quickly and easily apply for coverage through the new Healthcare Marketplace.
Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find coverage which fits your needs.


What is the Healthcare Marketplace?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.
The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.


What's the "Health Insurance Exchange"?
The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.
To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.


When Can I Sign Up for Health Insurance?
Keep the following terms in mind, as they will help make the search for insurance easier:

Obamacare - a nickname (sometimes considered derogatory) for the Affordable Care Act. Its full name is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March of 2010. 
Healthcare Marketplace - a resource for those without health insurance to find affordable coverage through either a state or federal exchange. 
Subsidized Health Insurance - The passing of the Affordable Care Act began the process of subsidizing (offering at a lower cost) health insurance plans for those who cannot otherwise afford health insurance and medical care. 
Medical Insurance - another term for health insurance. Also synonymous with healthcare plans and medical coverage.
Health Insurance Companies - companies which underwrite (provide) health insurance plans. They are responsible for paying out claims when their beneficiaries (customers) receive medical care. 
Health Insurance Quotes - most health insurance companies are required to give you an accurate estimate of what you should expect to pay as well as the terms of your health insurance plan, should you decide to do business with them. These estimates are commonly referred to as a “quote”. 
Premium - the monthly cost you must pay to maintain your health insurance coverage. Also sometimes referred to as a “monthly premium”. 
Deductible - a fixed dollar amount your insurance company will require you to pay out-of-pocket for your medical care before they will pay out any claims. The deductible and monthly premium are inversely related: the higher the premium, the lower the deductible, and vice versa.



How Can I Find the Best Health Insurance Company?
Right now, there are hundreds of different health insurance companies participating in the Exchange offering thousands of different plans. These companies are rated on a letter grading scale (A, B, C, etc.) based on their performance. Their grade is calculated by attributes such as financial stability, claim payments, and customer service. You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too.
You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too. Here is list of some companies that our partners work with: Aetna, UnitedHealthCare, Humana, BCBS, Cigna, Anthem, AARP, and many others.


What Happens if I Still Can’t Afford to Buy Health Insurance?
If you cannot purchase insurance, the government will charge you a fine when you file your yearly income taxes. For 2015, the fine will be either $325 or 2% of your income (the higher of the two will be your fee). This fee will increase to $695 or 2.5% of your yearly income in 2016. To avoid the penalty, you have to be carrying a health insurance plan for at least 9 months of the year.

How do I Buy Health Insurance?
For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
Now that the Affordable Care Act (sometimes referred to as “Obamacare”) is in place, it is much easier to find a health insurance plan based on your income and personal health needs. In most states, you may even qualify for financial subsidies. You can quickly and easily apply for coverage through the new Healthcare Marketplace.
Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find coverage which fits your needs.


What is the Healthcare Marketplace?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.
The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.


What’s the "Health Insurance Exchange"?
The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.
To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.


When Can I Sign Up for Health Insurance?
Keep the following terms in mind, as they will help make the search for insurance easier:

Obamacare - a nickname (sometimes considered derogatory) for the Affordable Care Act. Its full name is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March of 2010.
Healthcare Marketplace - a resource for those without health insurance to find affordable coverage through either a state or federal exchange.
Subsidized Health Insurance - The passing of the Affordable Care Act began the process of subsidizing (offering at a lower cost) health insurance plans for those who cannot otherwise afford health insurance and medical care.
Medical Insurance - another term for health insurance. Also synonymous with healthcare plans and medical coverage.
Health Insurance Companies - companies which underwrite (provide) health insurance plans. They are responsible for paying out claims when their beneficiaries (customers) receive medical care.
Health Insurance Quotes - most health insurance companies are required to give you an accurate estimate of what you should expect to pay as well as the terms of your health insurance plan, should you decide to do business with them. These estimates are commonly referred to as a “quote”.
