Aviation Technologies, Inc. - JustAPlaneBroker.com










a division of



Aviation Technologies, Inc. was established in 1995 as a service provider for a 135 operator, including fueling and handling arrangements though out the United States.  We added wet lease operations to our portfolio by ACMI contracts with 121 carriers and brokering as an all in product by arranging, fuel, ground handling, catering, etc to the end user.  This concept proved to be very effective in establishing relationships, on both sides of the playing field, through good business practices.  While our core business is aircraft brokering in the 121 world, we purchased our first 737-200 in 2004, and offered charter operations to the public under part 380 rules.  We utilized our DOT bonding, partnerships, existing relationships, and resources to provide air service to underserved markets.  These efforts forced us to continue to try and control our own destiny, by developing our own computerized reservation system.  After large capital investments, and years of development, we have successfully created WWW.CSRMANAGER.COM.  A complete internet based reservation system that can put charter inventory on the GDS�s (Global Distribution Systems) that travel agents and scheduled carriers utilize.  We offer this service to third parties though WWW.PUBLICCHARTERS.COM which allows our inventory to show up on Expedia, and Travelocity on a e-ticketing platform.  Our system also communicates live with DHS (Department of Homeland Security) and CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) for comparison of names against the government no fly watch lists for domestic and international travel.  We offer this service to airlines and airports through WWW.CHECKTSA.COM.  Please contact us to inquire about any of our value added services.

 Business Editors

 SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 26, 2004

 Aviation Technologies Inc., a leading supplier of engineered
aircraft components and a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment
Partners LLC, announced today that it has acquired Transicoil, a
division of Horizon Aerospace LLC of Victor, N.Y. Terms of the deal were
not disclosed.

 Transicoil is a technology leader in rotating electromechanical components, precision motion controls, instrumentation, and transducers.
The company, located in Norristown, Penn., will be merged with Aerospace
Display Systems (ADS) of Hatfield, Penn., a leader in the development
and manufacture of liquid crystal displays and modules for worldwide use
in military, business and commercial avionics instruments and equipment.
Initially, the two firms will continue to operate in separate facilities
under combined management, with the name ADS/Transicoil.

 "The obvious synergies between Aerospace Display Systems and
Transicoil make this a very good combination," said Roy Robinson,
chief executive officer of Aviation Technologies Inc. "Transicoil
has an excellent reputation for serving the aerospace and defense
industries in several product areas. We believe that customers will find
additional value when these product lines are combined with the LCD displays and instrumentation products of Aerospace Display Systems.

 "We are also pleased to be gaining the management experience
of Carl Deirmengian, the division president of Transicoil. Mr.
Deirmengian will serve as president of the merged ADS/Transicoil
organization."

 "Our many shared customers will now be able to go to one
entity for the Transicoil rotating electromechanical components,
precision motion controls, instrumentation, and transducers as well as
the LCDs, indicators and clocks of ADS," said Carl Deirmengian,
president of ADS/Transicoil. "We will build on the strengths of
both companies in forming a much stronger organization, able to develop
more products and address more customer needs than either could
individually."

The World’s First Personal Aircraft Cabin Pressure Monitor!


Your Custom Text Here













 







 The AltAlert™  Warns Pilots When Cabin Pressure Is Compromised









“Even the best trained pilots and OEM-supplied warning systems have suffered a lapse in cabin altitude awareness. The AltAlert closes this gap and can save lives.” AltAlert™ is the first and only mountable/wearable personal cabin pressure monitor. Ideal for use in all types of aircraft, this revolutionary device is every bit as invaluable as it is portable. AltAlert™ keeps pilots informed of  “relative altitude” and can avoid incidents/accidents related to cabin pressure problems, such as slow cabin pressure leaks and potentially deadly slow onset hypoxia. 






The AltAlert™ is made in the USA.




A Potentially Life-Saving Device For Pilots & Passengers!AltAlert™ has been expertly developed by Aviation Technology™ to provide a new level of confidence and risk-mitigation for aircraft pilots and passengers alike. Exclusively licensed from NASA under U.S. Patent 6,452,510, AltAlert™ will alarm when the cabin reaches an imminent and dangerously high cabin pressure-altitude (relative cabin pressure), based on FAA regulations. Once activated by installation of the battery (included), the unit will enter "sleep mode" while at ground level, but will begin sampling pressure and battery voltage every 15 seconds during climb and while in level flight (consistent flying altitude) at altitudes above sea level. AltAlert™ will operate as such until the battery is drained or removed (usually about 18 months, unless alarm is activated). The battery status can be tested at any time by pressing the “test” button.






Relative cabin pressure and battery status is indicated via a series of LED color changes and alarm tones. 



Relative cabin pressure and battery status is indicated via a series of LED color changes and alarm tones. An included chart explains these indications (color, blink-rate, etc.) in greater detail.AltAlert™ may be easily mounted on a flat surface in the cockpit or cabin of the aircraft, clipped to a visor, or worn where sound is not muffled by clothing.BUY FOR JUST $299.95!Testimonials"I read it in AIN Alerts. Thanks for making a product that might save mine and my passengers lives one day!" Mark Perich, Australia"I got my AltAlert unit end of 2014. I installed it, which was very easy, and I have it in the plane since then.  I fly with my Piper Meridian mostly at FL 270/FL280 and although the Meridian has an altitude warning system in the panel, I really like it that I a have a completely independent second altitude alert system in the cabin protecting me and my passengers. It’s there always, it switches itself on and the only thing I check before flight is the battery status. It is a very clever and simpel unit that’s monitoring the cabin altitude for you all the time. I can recommend it to every pilot flying pressurized. Even airline pilots can just have it in their pocket as a personal safety unit."  Arthur J.L. Valkieser, Cannes, France
