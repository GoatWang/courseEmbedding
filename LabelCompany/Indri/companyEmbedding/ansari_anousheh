Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]

Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.
Reactions in Iran[edit]

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show Aseman-e-Shab ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam-e-Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.[38]
Interviews[edit]
On September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said "I am having a wonderful time here. It's been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here."[39]
Honors and awards[edit]
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte & Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[40]
In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[41]
She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.
The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.[42]
In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[43]
In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her “Service to the Space Community.”[44]
Other activities and public appearances[edit]
Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.[45]
In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[46] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.
She served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[47]
On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards and accepted Farhadi's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump's immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries including Iran. Farhadi selected Naderi and Ansari as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.[48]
Ansari "has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center.[40] She has been active with several nonprofit organization, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization.[49] Other non-profit organizations include the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.
Personal life[edit]
While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas.

Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]

Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.
Reactions in Iran[edit]

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show Aseman-e-Shab ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam-e-Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.[38]
Interviews[edit]
On September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said "I am having a wonderful time here. It's been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here."[39]
Honors and awards[edit]
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte & Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[40]
In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[41]
She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.
The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.[42]
In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[43]
In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her “Service to the Space Community.”[44]
Other activities and public appearances[edit]
Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.[45]
In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[46] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.
She served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[47]
On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards and accepted Farhadi's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump's immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries including Iran. Farhadi selected Naderi and Ansari as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.[48]
Ansari "has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center.[40] She has been active with several nonprofit organization, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization.[49] Other non-profit organizations include the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.
Personal life[edit]
While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas.

Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]

Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.

Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]




Ansari holds a plant grown in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.


Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.
Reactions in Iran[edit]

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show Aseman-e-Shab ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam-e-Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.[38]
Interviews[edit]
On September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said "I am having a wonderful time here. It's been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here."[39]
Honors and awards[edit]
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte & Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[40]
In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[41]
She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.
The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.[42]
In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[43]
In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her “Service to the Space Community.”[44]
Other activities and public appearances[edit]
Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.[45]
In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[46] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.
She served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[47]
On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards and accepted Farhadi's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump's immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries including Iran. Farhadi selected Naderi and Ansari as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.[48]
Ansari "has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center.[40] She has been active with several nonprofit organization, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization.[49] Other non-profit organizations include the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.

While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas.

Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]




Ansari holds a plant grown in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.


Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.
Reactions in Iran[edit]

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show Aseman-e-Shab ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam-e-Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.[38]
Interviews[edit]
On September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said "I am having a wonderful time here. It's been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here."[39]
Honors and awards[edit]
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte & Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[40]
In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[41]
She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.
The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.[42]
In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[43]
In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her “Service to the Space Community.”[44]
Other activities and public appearances[edit]
Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.[45]
In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[46] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.
She served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[47]
On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards and accepted Farhadi's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump's immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries including Iran. Farhadi selected Naderi and Ansari as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.[48]
Ansari "has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center.[40] She has been active with several nonprofit organization, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization.[49] Other non-profit organizations include the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.
Personal life[edit]
While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas.

Early life[edit]
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward.[4] Ansari is Muslim.[5][6] She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She emigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager.[7] Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French, and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.[8]
She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master's degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.[2][9][10]
Career[edit]
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.[11]
In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as a wave of deregulation hit the telecommunications industry.[citation needed] The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered a line of products that allowed for integration between existing legacy telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology.[12] Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became "a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus' new INtelligentIP division."[13] As of March 2001[update], she remained in that position.[14][needs update]
In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, and is the current chairman and CEO.[15]
Space[edit]
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "spaceflight participant".[16]
Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation’s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.[17] Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard's sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the Ansari X PRIZE in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.[18]
The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.[19]
Spaceflight[edit]
Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.[20] On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.[21][22]




Ansari holds a plant grown in the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station.


Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."[23] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky.[24] The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.[25]
Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million USD. The space craft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC).[26][27] Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov.[28] She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a surprise kiss from her husband, Hamid.[29][30] The crew's rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.[31][32]
During her eight-day[citation needed] stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments,[33] including:

Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.
Iranian flag controversy[edit]
Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.[34] A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.[1]
At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.[35] She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".
Reactions to Ansari's flight[edit]
Crewmates[edit]
Michael Lopez-Alegria, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."[36]
Lopez-Alegria later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."[37]
The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.
Reactions in Iran[edit]

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show Aseman-e-Shab ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as Hambastegi and Jam-e-Jam Daily, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine NOJUM also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. NOJUM also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.[38]
Interviews[edit]
On September 22, 2006, she told reporters that she has no regrets and said "I am having a wonderful time here. It's been more than what I expected, and I am enjoying every single second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here."[39]
Honors and awards[edit]
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte & Touche’s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by Working Woman as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.[40]
In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women & Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.[41]
She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.
The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.[42]
In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of her humanitarian efforts.[43]
In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her “Service to the Space Community.”[44]
Other activities and public appearances[edit]
Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.[45]
In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film Space Tourists by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft.[46] The DVD of the film was released in 2011.
She served as the commencement speaker at and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.[47]
On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards and accepted Farhadi's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for The Salesman. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump's immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries including Iran. Farhadi selected Naderi and Ansari as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.[48]
Ansari "has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center.[40] She has been active with several nonprofit organization, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization.[49] Other non-profit organizations include the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.
Personal life[edit]
While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas.

Anousheh thoughts






















Frequently Asked Questions
                  There have been many questions about Anousheh, her life, her success and her space adventures.  Below are several of the commonly asked questions along with pictures for your enjoyment. 
                  When did you become interested in space?







Anousheh as a young child in Iran


Since  I was a young girl in Iran,  space has always fascinated me.  I would lie  on my balcony at night and just look up at the stars. I was fascinated by the  sheer mystery of space, what’s out there, what’s it like and how I could get  there. When I was young I made the decision I wanted to be an astronaut/astrophysicist  and travel into space. 


You arrived in the United States at the age of 16 not speaking a word of English. How challenging was it for you to progress to where you are today?







Anousheh as a teenager


Education  has always been emphasized in my family. So when I came to the United States  as a teenager, I was already in the mindset that I must work hard to learn  English, as well as my chosen field of study. There is so much opportunity in  the United States,  and I have worked hard to take advantage of those opportunities to achieve my  dreams. It’s been challenging, but following your dreams is always a challenge.  I wouldn’t want to live any other way.
                      


What afforded you the opportunity to take this trip?
My  husband and I started our own company, Telecom Technologies, Inc. using all our  money out of our savings in 1994 and we worked very hard for many years.  This company eventually developed a  softswitch which enabled voice communications over the Internet. In 2001, we merged  with Sonus Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a provider of  IP-based voice infrastructure products, in a deal worth approximately $750  million. 
How did you get into the telecommunications business?
I  first developed an interest in telecommunications while in college. I earned a bachelor’s  degree in electronics and computer engineering from George  Mason University  in 1989, followed by a master’s degree in electrical engineering from George Washington University in 1992.  My  husband and I both launched our careers at MCI, where we gained incredible  hands-on experience in the telecommunications industry. Then we saw a great  opportunity to launch our own telecommunications venture.  
Why was Telecom Technologies, Inc. so successful?







Anousheh in the Sept 2000  issue of Forbes magazine


Telecom  Technologies, Inc. had fast success in part because of a groundbreaking  business strategy. Rather than pursuing no-holds-barred competition with  closed, proprietary technologies, we followed a strategy of cooperation and  open standards. Our company actually worked with – instead of against – its  competitors’ products. We invited all telecom product manufacturers to  participate in an interoperability lab that our company launched and funded,  despite the extra cost. This lab was a breakthrough for the entire  telecommunications industry. It encouraged the development of products and  services that could work together in voice networks, instead of being  incompatible.


Why did you sell your company while it was still an expanding and lucrative company?
In our hearts, my family and I are entrepreneurs.       We embrace the challenges of developing and launching technologies that       will literally change industries. By 2001, Telecom Technologies owned three key U.S.       patents and had 250 employees. The time was right for a merger with Sonus Networks, Inc. which offered the opportunity to grow the capabilities of       the technology.
What       convinced you to undertake such an unusual adventure to space?
As  I’ve mentioned before, I’ve had a passion for space since I was very young. I  never lost that passion even as I grew older and continued on into my business  life.  Once Dennis Tito started talking  about buying a trip to space on the Russian Soyuz space craft in the 1990s, I  decided to work really hard at my business and if all else failed, I could buy  a ticket!
What prompted you to set up the Ansari X Prize       and was it worth paying such a large prize?







Hamid Ansari, Erik  Lindbergh, Anousheh Ansari, Peter  Diamandis, and Amir Ansari at X Prize


 





X Prize Spaceship One  Celebration



My family worked with the X Prize Foundation to provide title sponsorship for the Ansari X Prize. Together, we awarded $10 million for the first non-governmental organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. In 2004, aerospace designer Burt Rutan won the prize.
Space is a very important part of the future of human race, and space travel is  something everyone should eventually have access to. My family is working  toward helping the industry and making space travel more affordable and  accessible to more people. The Ansari X Prize was an important step in that  process, and it was well worth the investment.


You were not originally planned to travel on this Expedition. Weren’t you just training as a backup?







Dice K and Anousheh training in a Zero Gravity Plane


In February 2006, I was asked to serve as the backup for Daisuke Enomoto (Dice-K),  a private space explorer from Japan  who had been slated for the trip in September. I agreed and shortly after that  I started my six-month training course in Star City, Russia, as well as  cross-training at Johnson Space Center  in Houston.  In August 2006, just a few weeks before the scheduled flight, Dice-K was medically disqualified. I then became a primary  crew of the Soyuz TMA-9 as a replacement. 


Did you perform the same training as the Dice-K?







Dice K, Anousheh and Hamid weightless in a Zero Gravity Flight


Yes, Dice-K and I had the exact same training during the six months prior to the  trip.


Did you have to undergo full astronaut training for your trip?

Water Survival Training
Classroom Training
 



I  started a six-month preparation for the trip in February 2006 at Star City in  Russia.  This included classroom training, simulator training, zero-g and survival  techniques – the same training received by astronauts but while my training was  at ‘user’ level, they undergo around two years’ more in-depth training to a  ‘repair systems’ level. However, I had to take an active role as crew  member.



What was your least favorite training experience?

The spinning chair was my least favourite training experience. 


Did you ever think about quitting?







Anousheh’s personalized space gloves


NEVER!


Why don’t you call your self a space “tourist”?
As I  described above, I was part of a six-month training program along side the  other crew members and I took an active role as a crew member. I think the term  ‘space tourist’ undermines what you have to do on the mission. 
Can you describe your feelings as you boarded the spacecraft and prepared for lift       off?







September 18, 2007 TMA9 Soyuz Launch


The  day of the flight, I thought I would be really nervous so I was surprised to  see that I wasn’t. We spent two and a half hours in the capsule preparing  launch procedures. After that they put some music on and we had a chance to  relax – it was actually very ‘zen-like’, waiting for the moment when my dream  would come true. I had watched the International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 13 launch during my training so I was prepared for a lot  of noise and explosions, but as the Soyuz lifted off at 2.5G, from inside the  capsule the launch felt surprisingly smooth. My American fellow crew member who  had also flown the Shuttle remarked that the Soyuz was very smooth in  comparison.


Who were your crew members?







September 18, 2007 TMA9 Soyuz  Launch


I  was part of Expedition 14 which included a total of three crew members,  Commander Michael Lopez-Alegria, flight engineer Mikhail Tyurin and myself. Our mission was to relieve Expedition 13 Commander Pavel Vingradov and NASA Science Officer  Jeff Williams after their six-month mission on the ISS. 


How long were you up in space?
It  took two days to travel to the International Space Station then I spent eight  days on the ISS before returning to earth with Vinogradov and Williams, the members of the ISS Expedition 13 crew who had spent the previous six months on  board the ISS.  The trip back to earth  took about four hours.
Why did it take you two days to reach the ISS?







TMA9 Soyuz Docking to the ISS


It doesn’t take very long to get out of the earth’s atmosphere; however, our  journey required circling the earth to get to the appropriate orbit for docking  to the International Space Station.
                    


What is the International Space Station?







The ISS and a view of Earth


 





Animated view of the ISS



The International  Space Station (ISS) is a collaboration of 16 countries who have come  together cooperatively and peacefully to work in space.  The ISS rotates 200 miles above the earth and  has about 1500 cubic feet of space which is the same square footage as a three  bedroom house.  The ISS ways about 454,  240 pounds which is approximately the weight of 40 elephants.  It moves at the speed of 17,500 miles per  hour and makes a full rotation around the earth once every 90 minutes.  So each day I was able to see 16 sunsets and  16 sunrises.



What was the most awesome thing about being in space?







Anousheh weightless in the ISS


The feeling of weightlessness was the most incredible thing about the trip. Nothing  compares to the absolute freedom I felt when I could literally fly across the  room and propel myself with the gentle push of a single finger.


Did you at any point pinch yourself and say, "I can't believe I'm here!"







Anousheh experiencing the fun of weightlessness


Yes!  Every morning when I woke up I had to remind  myself that I was not dreaming.


Is this the craziest thing you ever did?
Yes.  I’m not a thrill seeker.  Ridding rockets is not what interests  me.  The destination is what I love, and  the only way to get here now is through the Soyuz.
How did you prepare yourself for this journey, besides the intensive training?
I  have been mentally preparing for it all my life, imagining this moment and my  entire trip.
How was your ISS and Soyuz experience from the perspective of 'habitability'?

Inside the ISS



('Habitability' comprises human factor issues including, but not limited to: food, sleep, hygiene, noise, temperature, odours, movement, orientation, safety, ergonomics, provision for exercise, recreation, habitat configuration.)
The Soyuz is comprised of two  habitable areas, the descent module and the Habitation module.  Both are  fairly small the descend module is where the three crew stay during launch  and landing.  Each crew member has a seat liner that has been moulded to  their body.  The space is cramped and you have to sit in a fetal  position.  The habitation module is where you eat, sleep and go to  toilet.  It is also fairly small.  With all the cargo, you have  enough room for three people to stand next to each other.  The ISS is a  much roomier place. Considering you are living 220 mile above earth, it is  fairly nice and has all the necessities for leaving comfortably.  Although,  the noise level is high and the space is not designed optimally.  There is  enough variety of exercise equipment available to give everyone a chance to  exercise.


Do you have any suggestions for design improvements that can enhance the 'habitability' of future space       habitats?  
I think adding a shower would be nice!  Auto electronic wireless inventory scanners and management  system would save a lot of time for the Astronauts.  Another consideration  could be to have a low noise area that would serve as sleeping quarters for all  crew members.
How would you rate the experience?







A beautiful view of our Earth


The  whole experience was absolutely great! From the preparation in Star City  where I could immerse myself in the space world, meeting and getting to know  cosmonauts and astronauts and hearing their stories and experiences, to the  trip itself. That was out of this world! Being in space was absolutely amazing,  especially experiencing weightlessness. Seeing the Earth from the Space Station  changed my perception of the planet and made me feel much more protective of  this precious gift that we have to look after. I didn’t want to go back and  even considered hiding on board the ISS, although I did miss my husband and  family very much by then!
                    


How would you compare the experience of actually going into space with what you thought       it might be like, pre-lift-off? Did it meet or exceed your expectations?
After years  of anticipation and six months of intensive training, my expectations were  extremely high. Even so, my trip into space exceeded those expectations. It was  the most thrilling experience of my life.
What was the general reaction of your family when they found out about your       plans of traveling to space? And when was that exactly?







Anousheh and  her  husband, Hamid


I told my family soon after I was  notified on August 21, 2006. They were all very excited and told me that they  will be praying for my safe return. They’ve always known this was my life-long  dream. I’ve always said that even if it was a one-way ticket, I would have  taken it.
                    


Was it difficult being away from your family during your training and flight?







Anousheh with her family the day of the launch


I spent  more than six months in intensive training to prepare for my journey to space.  During that time, I stayed almost full time in Star City Moscow.  I was  able to talk to my husband and the rest of my family on the phone.  Being  away from them, especially my husband was one of the most difficult parts of  this journey, but it was the only way I could realize my dream. 


Was this experience worth the financial investment you made to take the trip?
It is hard  to put a price on your dream.  I was ready to risk my life for this  dream.  The experience and the  satisfaction you get from knowing that you have been able to realize your  childhood dream through a lot of hard work, perseverance , and sacrifice made  it all worth it, as well as the months spent in preparation, were well worth  it.  Seeing the Earth from the Space  Station changed my perception of the planet and made me feel much more  protective of this precious gift that we have to look after. 
How did you purchase this trip?
I purchased  this trip with the Russian Space Agency through a company called Space  Adventures.  Space Adventures has purchased several seats on Russia Soyuz  Expeditions.
Why do you think space is so important to society and young people today?
There  are many reasons that we need space exploration.  We can investigate many problems on earth in  microgravity that will help us to ensure the longevity of the human race. And  every science can be applied to space from biology to new research in engines,  materials and fuels. 
Do you think your trip has increased people’s interest in space, especially       among women?
I think my  trip put a more public face on space, especially for women.  People look  at me and see that I’m a regular person. That allows them to understand that  flying to space is also possible for them.   We live in an exciting  time, where the doors to the “final frontiers” have been kicked open to the  public.  There are many new developments in the space industry right  now.  Just two years ago the successful flight of the Ansari X Prize  vehicle provided the first glimpse into commercial space possibilities.  Recently,  NASA announced that it would pursue development of a moon base which could have  potential commercial applications in future.  The possibilities are  endless for people who are interested in space and you don’t have to just be a  pilot or rocket scientist to pursue your interest in space.
What advice would you give to a young person considering science, engineering or       space? 
There  is so much going on in the space industry right now. Government agencies are  still doing a lot of work while private space exploration is really growing.  Companies like Space  Adventures and Virgin Galactic are helping to find new ways so that even more private  citizens can experience space, and there will be many exciting projects to work  on.  
In your professional life, did you or do you ever feel you had to prove yourself       because you’re a woman?
All  the time, but I did not let this make me bitter.  It was just an extra step and I took it to  get to my destination.
Being a successful female entrepreneur, do you see it as a challenge to balance       work and family life? 
Creating  balance is a challenge for every business person, especially women. I think  perhaps the best way to accomplish this balance is to focus on your goals. That  way, you can ensure that your time is being focused in a way that furthers  those goals and objectives, both in your personal and professional life.

Why is space important to you?
I  feel space is a very important part of the future of human race and space  travel is something everyone should eventually have access to.  My family and I are working to raise interest  in private investment into space travel, which I  believe is critical to the future of the human race. We also hope to help make space travel more  affordable and accessible to more people. 
You’re going to be in world history.  How do you feel about that?
Fortunately,  by going into space, I have gained a media platform to deliver my message to  more and more people around the world. First, I’m working to inspire all people  – especially women and girls – to chase their own dreams, no matter how lofty  their goals may seem. I feel that  as long as my trip brings a positive inspiration for our youth it is a good  event to be recorded in history.  
How       do you think your Iranian background has shaped the person you are today? 
I’m a U.S.  citizen who was born in Iran.  Both countries are part of who I am. My roots are in Iran  and America has given me the  opportunities that I would have never had in Iran and made it possible for me to  realize my dream. In particular, my Iranian heritage instilled a focus on  education and a strong work ethic into my everyday life. Both countries are part of who I am.    
While on the International Space  Station, I was thrilled to see people from all over the Middle   East post messages on my blog, saying how excited they were to see the first  Iranian astronaut blast into space. It showed how people of all backgrounds  share a common bond – the longing to accomplish their dreams.
Are you a political person?
I am non political person and do  not like controversy.
You've set several firsts/new benchmarks in the world.  Was this an exercise in showmanship or a genuine desire to fulfil a lifelong hobby?
Ever since  I was young, I have had a passion for space and space exploration. I was  fascinated by the sheer mystery of space, what’s out there, what’s it like and  how I could get there. The fact that I set different benchmarks means very  little in my journey. The good thing about this is that it has provided me  the media platform to deliver my message to more and more people around the  world.
Would you recommend it to those with a strong interest in travel/flight/exploration       to endeavour to follow in your footsteps?
I would  definitely recommend this to whoever has a passion for Space, for flight, for  natural beauty, for exploration, and for having an out of this world  experience.  I hope that someday, everyone has the opportunity to go into  space. This is certainly a life altering experience.  This experience  opens your mind to a bigger perspective on our home planet, the universe and  the role we play in this equation.
Do you think being a woman matters in space?
I don’t think it should make any  difference.  It should just be proof that  both women and men can equally enjoy a trip to space.
Do you consider yourself an example for all women?
I hope to  be.  I want to inspire all  children (especially girls) and women around the world to dream big and to go  after their dream.
What are you doing now that you are back from space?
I am very  busy with many projects, but my main focus is our technology company Prodea Systems  which was launched the same day I launched into  space, September 18, 2006.  I’m also writing  my memoirs with Homer  Hickam, the #1  best selling author of Rocket Boys which was produced into the movie October  Sky. I am a member of the Board of Trustees of the X Prize Foundation, as well  as a member of the X Prize Foundation’s Vision Circle.  I’m working on an educational program to help  inspire our youth’s interest in learning and going into math and science  (especially girls) and to renew their interest and understanding of space.  I also work with two philanthropic  organizations, Ashoka  and PARSA.
Can you tell us more about Prodea Systems?
My family  and I are running our new technology company called Prodea Systems, Inc.  This has been another dream of ours for some time.  This company will dramatically  alter a consumer’s digital living experience and unleash the power of the  Internet to all consumers (technical and non-technical). We haven’t launched  our product to the market at this time but you can read more about our company  on our web site (www.prodeasystems.com).
Can you tell us more about your book and Homer Hickam and how you chose him to help with       your book?







Anousheh with Homer Hickam


Homer actually contacted one of my employees when he found out I was going to  space.  He said that he read my blog while I was  in space.  We met in Alabama in December 2006 after I returned  from space.  Homer and I share the same  passion and interest in space which was what I hoped to find in a co-author,  plus we get along great! (You can  find out more details about Homer at www.homerhickam.com)


What is Ashoka?
ASHOKA is a  non-profit organization that supports social entrepreneurship around the world,  including the Middle East and Central Asia.
                  (You can  read more about this organization at www.ashoka.org)
What is PARSA?
PARSA Community  Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes strategic philanthropy  and social entrepreneurship among the global Iranian community.  
                  (You can  read more about this organization at www.parsacf.org)
Do you have your own song?
Well yes,  actually, “Be The Change” is a composition by Deep Dish who is Grammy winning  duo of Sharam Tayebi and Ali “Dubfire” Shirazinia.  I was very flattered when I found out they  dedicated this song to me.
                  (You can  find out more details about Deep Dish at on their site  www.deepdish.com)
Any other dreams or adventures that you hope to accomplish in the near future? 
My dream is  to see space travel become like a normal option for family vacations in the  future.
Do you have a message for other people that want to be in your shoes?
My message  to them is not to give up and to be part of a positive force to bring space  travel to the general public.  The more  interest sparked in this area and the more innovation is generated, the more  affordable this trip will become and they will be one step closer to realize  their dream.

Official X-Prize Biography (September 2006)

Anousheh Ansari brings more than two decades as a successful serial entrepreneur to Prodea Systems, where she serves as chairman. Anousheh is capturing headlines around the world as the first female private space explorer. On Sept. 18, she blasted off for an eight-day expedition aboard the International Space Station. Anousheh earned a place in history as the fourth private explorer to visit space, and the first astronaut of Iranian descent. While in space, she is conducting tests of Prodea Systems digital home technology.

An active proponent of world-changing technologies, Anousheh has dreamed of space exploration since childhood. Her family provided the title sponsorship for the Ansari X PRIZE, a $10 million cash award for the first non-governmental organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. This feat was accomplished in 2004 by legendary aerospace designer Burt Rutan in 2004.

Prior to founding Prodea Systems, Anousheh served as co-founder, chief executive officer and chairman of the board for Telecom Technologies, Inc. After earning three key U.S. patents and growing the company to 250 employees with 100 percent sequential growth year over year since inception, the company successfully merged with Sonus Networks, Inc., a provider of IP-based voice infrastructure products.

A living example of the American dream, Anousheh emigrated to the United States as a teenager who did not speak English. She immersed herself in education, earning a bachelor's degree in electronics and computer engineering from George Mason University, followed by a master's degree in electrical engineering from George Washington University. She is currently working toward a master's degree in astronomy from Swinburne University.

Anousheh is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation's Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees. She has received multiple honors, including the Working Woman's National Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, George Mason University's Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, George Washington University's Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, and the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Southwest Region. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies earned recognition as one of Inc. Magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies and Deloitte & Touche's Fast 500 technology companies.

In addition to her business achievements, Anousheh actively pursues ways to enable social entrepreneurs to bring about radical change globally. She has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children's Advocacy Center. She works with a number of other non-profit organizations, including the Ashoka Foundation in its support of social entrepreneurs.

Lucy Sanders: Hi, this is Lucy Sanders. I'm the CEO of the National Center for Women and Information Technology, or NCWIT. And this is one of a series of interviews we are doing with women who have started IT companies. We've heard some wonderful stories from some very fabulous women, and we have another great interview in this series today. With me is Larry Nelson from w3w3.com. Larry, why don't you tell us a little bit about w3w3?
Larry Nelson: My wife, Pat, and I started the Internet radio show, w3w3.com, in 1998. We archive everything from photos to articles and all of the interviews. And this NCWIT hero series, I tell you, is one of the most exciting projects ‑‑ period ‑‑ that we've ever worked on. And it's getting a great deal of response from both business and government, as well as education.
Lucy: Well and we're really happy to have you here today, and we're also very grateful that you are syndicating this series on your site as well. Also with us is Lee Kennedy, NCWIT board director and serial entrepreneur herself, having just started a new company called Tricalyx - helping all of us use the web better for our businesses. So, welcome, Lee.
Lee Kennedy: Thanks, Lucy. These are really fun to participate in.
Lucy: Well today, we have a great interview with Anousheh Ansari, the chairman and cofounder of Prodea Systems. I took a look at the website of Prodea Systems, and it's just got the coolest mission. It's a new company. It's focused on the home, on the digital environment within the home. Everything from voice services and networking services in the home to parental control and maybe child control. That would be all right, too. And home automation. Anousheh has the coolest title, Larry and Lee, I have to tell you. Because not only is she chairman and cofounder of Prodea Systems, but she also has the title of "first private female space explorer."
Larry: All right!
Lucy: So Anousheh, we are really happy to have you here. Welcome.
Anousheh: Thank you. I'm happy to be on the show.
Lucy: With that, we'll just get right to the interview. We have a lot of questions to ask you about entrepreneurship and technology.
Lee: So Anuosheh, one of my favorite questions is to hear how you first got into technology. Was it something through your childhood, or there was a moment in time that it all started being so interesting? And then we'd also love to know, what do you think are cool today, as far as the technologies that are out?
Anousheh: I always loved science and math growing up. I was born in Iran; I grew up there and then came to the United States when I was about 16 years old. And I thought that this was my opportunity to get involved with something really cool and great. And that's why... When I graduated from high school, at that time the field of telecommunication and electrical engineering was the hottest field, and it was growing and a lot of technology was being developed back then. And that's why I chose electrical engineering as my career and ended up getting a bachelor degree and a master's degree in electrical engineering - and basically built a career in telecommunication dealing with planning and developing the future networks that would allow communication technologies to be enhanced. This is what we see today. And I think that's one of the coolest things today with the Internet, the use of Internet by the entire population ‑ as part of education and just on a daily basis for communication. I think that has been one of the coolest technologies that has been developed, and it has in the past decade.
Lucy: Anousheh, you cofounded Telecom Technologies in the early 90s, when you were doing some of the early work on voice over IP and soft switches.
Anousheh: Exactly, yes.
Lucy: That was a pretty exciting time. We were working on that in Bell Labs, and so we followed your company. So it was a great effort and very entrepreneurial.
Anousheh: Yes. One of the things that really gets me excited and makes me start up companies is the fact that you can basically build something new, try to introduce a change in a way that people are used to doing certain activities, and basically create something out of scratch that doesn't exist and would revolutionize whatever it is that you are trying to do with it. So that's part of the reason I love being able to be a technologist and being in this field, and also being able to start up companies that introduce these types of new gadgets into the market.
Larry: That's a great segue into a question I've got. Here you are, Anousheh. You're the first female private space explorer. All kinds of opportunities. A wonderful background. And there's always the risk, as well as the adrenaline rush about being an entrepreneur. What is it... You were just beginning to talk about some of the reasons why you are an entrepreneur. And what about being an entrepreneur makes you tick?
Anousheh: Well, being an entrepreneur means that you are sort of inventing something new. You're giving birth to a company. You're giving birth to a new product, a new service. And that's always exciting. And to me, I don't like to just have a repetitive life where I do the same thing over and over. I love to be able to learn something new, explore something new. I'm an explorer by nature, and being an entrepreneur allows me to explore new opportunities and technologies. And that's the best part of it. But also, being an entrepreneur I love to help people, and I think through the products that we develop in my company, we will be able to help a lot of people. Whether it's help them to get over the difficulties of a technology and use it. This is what we do with my new company at Prodea. Or helping employees, creating new jobs, new opportunities for people that work in my company. So all along, whether it's creating something or just building a company and giving others the opportunity to build a career, I think it's exciting to be at the helm of these types of activities and that's what makes being an entrepreneur really exciting for me.
Lucy: Well and your new company is in a great niche, I have to say. We're shopping for a new washer and dryer now, and we can actually put it on the network in our house.
Larry: Oh, wow.
Lucy: I'm not sure what I'm going to say to the washer and dryer. But Anousheh, maybe you can help me out with that.
Anousheh: The technology we're developing is geared toward taking advantage of all these new smart devices that are being built for the home. But one thing we realized was that we wanted everyone to be able to take advantage of this new technology and use it. But it is sometimes complicated. A lot of things are based on PC, and some of our parents, for example, are not really excited about using PCs, and it's a drag for them. So, it doesn't have to be that way. Technology doesn't have to be difficult to use or complicated. We feel technology is something that's there to make your life easier not more difficult. So what we've done is we've decided to make all these technologies very simple and easy to use. And as much as possible let you use your TV and your remote control to interface with everything smart in your house and manage everything versus having to deal with a computer.
Lucy: Well, it really does sound like a great company. And like I said, it really does fill a great niche for people, especially some of the things like data backup and other things that people put a lot of time and effort into their computers and then they lose it all, for example if it crashes. So it's a great value proposition. In this series, we are very interested in asking people about their role models or people who really encouraged them on this path toward entrepreneurship. Can you tell us a bit about who influenced you?
Anousheh: I have to say the biggest influence in my life has been by husband, who is also my partner in the business. We started our companies together, and he's always been there encouraging me to take on new challenges in my life. And when I do take them on, he's right beside me supporting and helping me through all the difficult time. So having a really good partner, whether it's a good friend, someone in your family or a spouse, is always the greatest thing to have when you have a new challenge that you're facing.
Lucy: That's great. There's not many of us that have a partner that's right along in our career.
Anousheh: That's true. I've been very fortunate, because sometimes it's difficult to work with your spouse. But in our case, it's a great working relationship, and we have complementary skills which makes it easy to work together. So I've been very fortunate in that regard.
Lucy: So on the flip side of that, when you think about your career, what's been the toughest thing you've had to do?
Anousheh: Being an entrepreneur and starting new companies require a lot of sacrifice. Sacrifice that you have to make. Because in order to be really successful, your company becomes your life. And then you have to really dedicate your time and energy fully to this endeavor that you start. And doing anything less than that means that you're doing yourself and your employees a disservice. So, it does require a lot of sacrifice of your personal time and personal hobbies and things that you enjoy. At least for the period of high growth that you experience at the beginning of a company's life cycle, you have to be ready to make a lot of time sacrifices and personal sacrifice.
Lucy: I think that that is really good advice that you would give to a young person who is considering entrepreneuship: that you be prepared for those type of time sacrifices and be prepared for the amount of dedication it takes to be an entrepreneur. If you were sitting with a room of young people and giving them any further advice about entrepreneurship, what else would you tell them?
Anousheh: Maybe just continue on! I don't want to make it sound like it's really bad or difficult to be an entrepreneur. It does require commitment. It is hard work, but it is also highly rewarding. So when you can look back and see yourself building a successful company. When you see your employees happy and excited about the success of the company. When you introduce something new, a product in the world that gets really high marks and everyone loves using it and raves about it. It is very rewarding, and you will feel very good about it. So my advice to everyone is find something that you love to do and you are passionate about ‑ you enjoy. Because if you're not passionate about something, it's very difficult to be dedicated to it. So find something you enjoy and love and you're passionate about. And then dedicate all you've got to make it a success. And if you have those two things, I think with your passion and dedication, there is nothing that you cannot accomplish.
Lucy: So when you think about yourself and your personal characteristics, what do you think has given you the advantage to be an entrepreneur?
Anousheh: I think one thing that has helped me maybe is being an immigrant and coming to the United States. I had to basically build a new life for myself, and adjust very quickly to a new environment, new culture, learn a new language. So I think a lot of the fears and risk averseness that people may have develop living in a comfortable lifestyle and having everything be provided to them as they grow up. That sort of went away from me and made me sort of a person that would be willing to take risks and face the challenges and not be afraid of failure. Because being an immigrant and staring life over, you learn to be a survivor and how to face your challenges and basically overcome them. And that has been a great skill set that I've developed and has helped me in my career.
Larry: I have a lot of empathy ‑‑ Pat and I both do ‑‑ for you moving into a new country. I understand you did not know English before you moved here. Is that true?
Anousheh: Yes, that's true.
Larry: And we've owned businesses and lived in five different countries. And other than Australia, the other countries didn't speak English. So I really had quite a learning lesson to go through. Pat and I, we've owned our own business together for 35‑plus years. So I just want to let you know, there's hope down the road.
Larry: So with that, this is my litte segue into... How do you balance your busy, busy professional life along with your personal life and your family and everything else?
Anousheh: It's difficult to balance it, but you find little things that basically take the stress away and help you refocus and get energy you need to face your new challenges on a daily basis. Of course, spending time with family is always good. I love the outdoors, so if I get a chance to go out and hike or bike around, that's always great. If I don't have time to leave, just listening to some music that I love reenergizes me and gives me that break I need to go back to whatever it is I'm doing. You have to find things that are accessible and doable in your busy life and try to fit some time in your schedule to just have time to yourself and be able to recoup and refocus.
Larry: It's amazing, some of the things that you pointed out remind me of Lucy's favorite way of calling it ‑‑ not balance, but integrating.
Anousheh: Absolutely. You have to find ways of integrating what you like into your business life. And it's difficult at times, but I think over time with experience, you learn how to do it. Lucy: I want to maybe inject a ninth question, even though we promised we'd only have eight. I think our listeners would probably love to hear a few comments from you about your insights from your space travel, especially since it's very relevant to the topic of adventure and entrepreneurship and technology.
Anousheh: Just to give you a little bit of background. Even though my career was in telecommunications, one of my greatest passions since I was a little girl was to fly to space. And when I came to the United States, there were difficulties that I was facing because I was an immigrant, didn't have citizenship. So I couldn't become an astronaut, but I never gave up on that dream. And I told myself, and I believed, that one day I would be able to fulfill that dream. And my career in electrical engineering and being an entrepreneur is what ultimately helped me realize that dream. And it was a wonderful thing to be able to realize it while I had just celebrated my 40th birthday. It was a great sense of accomplishment and an experience that has changed my life and will be with me forever. It's given me a new perspective on life. And it helps me every day. For me, one of the things I do ‑‑ when you were talking about balancing your personal life and doing things you love ‑‑ when I'm very stressed out and I can't get out and I need to do something, I just close my eyes and try to remember what it was like to be in space and to float around. And that sort of brings back all of those good sensations and good memories, and it helps me to get through the day.
Lucy: Well I know, for one, I'll be watching you, probably in your next company, doing something with space.
Anousheh: I hope so too, because it's one of those things that when you do it once, it's sort of like an addiction. You want to be able to fly again, and I hope that I'll get a chance to fly again to space someday. And I'll let you know. Maybe the next company.
Lucy: Maybe then they could take a 53 year old woman with her.
Anousheh: There's no age limit. As long as you're young at heart, you can fly to space.
Lucy: That would be so cool. Well Anousheh, you've really achieved a lot in your career. What's next for you? We know space travel is next. Anything else?
Anousheh: There's a lot of things happening in my life. Of course, our company is in the very early stages and growing very rapidly, so that takes up a lot of my time. But I have also a personal passion for space and making sure that the space industry ‑ or the private side of the space industry ‑ grows and provides opportunity for people like myself who love to fly to space to do it. That's why I'm involved with the X PRIZE Foundation and creating opportunities to expand the whole private sector in the space industry. Also, global education is something that is important for me. Because I believe that our future is going to be built by our young generation. And being able to give them the best opportunity to gain all the knowledge they need, and to be able to use their imagination, and be able to maintain that imaginative mind they have when they're four or five years old and carry that imagination throughout their life. And be able to use the knowledge they gain from their environment and create something better ‑ something new and a world that's really peaceful and safe. That's something that I dream of, and I'm trying to do my part in making sure that environment is available to our young generation.
Larry: Anousheh, I would like to just personally thank you, and I'm sure this is from all of us. The inspiration that came along with not only you being the first female private space explorer, but the idea of what you had to all go through behind it. From not understanding English, and working in a new country, and really exploring your passions between math and IT. And it's just been a great story that we will continue to carry that flag for. You're super.
Anousheh: Thank you. It was a pleasure to talk to you guys today.
Larry: By the way, you listeners out there, first of all, this will be on the NCWIT.org website. That's www.ncwit.org. And of course, we'll also have it on our blog and our podcast at w3w3.com, where you can download it 24/7. And Lee and Lucy and Larry ‑ the three Ls ‑ we want to thank you so much, Anousheh, for joining us today.
Anousheh: Thank you. Larry: Thank you so much. Lucy: Thank you. Bye bye. Larry: See you soon.
Anousheh: Bye.

Mike Simmons
Founder and President
Astronomers without Borders
Mike Simmons has been an  amateur astronomer for more than 35 years and loves sharing the sky with  others. Mike joined the Los Angeles Astronomical Society in the early 1970s and  served in many capacities including two terms as President and ten years on the  Board of Directors. In 1976 he joined the staff of Griffith Observatory where  he operated the Zeiss 12-inch refracting telescope for the public and described  the many facets of astronomy to tens of thousands of visitors. 

                In the early 1980s Mike was instrumental in founding the Mount Wilson  Observatory Association (MWOA), a support organization dedicated to improving  the experience of visitors to the renowned observatory. He served as the  founding President of MWOA and has been on the Board of Trustees ever since. He  is currently the MWOA Vice President. 

                Mike's outreach efforts in astronomy broadened in 1999 when he traveled to Iran for a  total solar eclipse. In Iran  he found an enthusiastic astronomy community lacking the resources easily found  in the West. He has since traveled to Iran  several times, and in 2004 he led a group of Westerners to Iran to observe  the rare Transit of Venus alongside hundreds of Iranian amateur astronomers. In  2006 Mike traveled to the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, bringing  observing equipment donated by American astronomers to their enthusiastic but  isolated Kurdish counterparts. He has also assisted amateur astronomers and  educators in many countries via the Internet. Seeing astronomy as a universal  interest that transcends cultural differences, Mike founded Astronomers Without  Borders in 2006. He now serves as President of this effort to unite astronomy  and space enthusiasts around the world through those common interests. 

                Mike is also a writer and photographer who has contributed to publications  including Scientific American, Astronomy and Sky and Telescope. He regularly  gives presentations, both in the US and abroad, on his experiences  and interests, and on his outlook on international relations through astronomy.
