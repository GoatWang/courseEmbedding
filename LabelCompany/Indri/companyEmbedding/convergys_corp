The transaction covers all of IM's business, including Smart Revenue Solutions, across different verticals, including communications, utilities, and logistics. The Convergys IM business has enabled service providers around the world to transform their BSS with innovative billing, customer care, and revenue management solutions.The IM business will be integrated into NetCracker Technology, and NetCracker will be responsible for all business operations of this entity. The combined communications software assets of Convergys IM, NetCracker, and NEC create the largest and most comprehensive end-to-end BSS/OSS offering in the industry."This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to bringing the most innovative software solutions to service providers around the globe," said Dr. Nobuhiro Endo, President of NEC. "The rapid integration of the Convergys IM business into NetCracker will optimize business operations and leverage powerful new synergies with NEC."The need for advanced BSS solutions is being driven by the fast emerging Gigabit society that demands access to content and connectivity anytime, anywhere, on any device. Service providers must have the ability to monetize the surging data traffic and - at the same time - meet customer demands for quality and a compelling user experience. This requires a new approach to BSS, one that is driven by productized and flexible platforms, real-time rating and charging, and new cost models that leverage managed services and the cloud infrastructure."With a track record of delivering customer success that spans two decades, we know what it takes to make BSS/OSS transformation possible," said Andrew Feinberg, President and CEO of NetCracker Technology. "Having the most comprehensive and innovative solutions portfolio, a highly skilled global workforce, and a deep understanding of the BSS and OSS domains, enables us to partner with our customers and help them achieve their business objectives in this rapidly changing industry. The addition of the Convergys IM business to the NetCracker family is yet another important accomplishment in our mission to deliver the most compelling solutions to communications service providers throughout the world."To learn more about NetCracker and our expanding global solutions footprint, please visit www.NetCracker.com.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
