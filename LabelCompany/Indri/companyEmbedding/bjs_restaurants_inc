Nit Wit®
is a Belgian Witbier
a traditional Belgian-style beer that literally means “White Beer.”
It’s a light yet flavorful wheat-based beer that is spiced with coriander and orange peel. The hopping rate is very low so the finish is dry rather than bitter.
Available for a limited time only.
Check your local restaurant for availability.
ABV: 4.7%
IBU: 9

Experimental BrewingBoulder, Colorado is a great place to be if you love craft beer. Ingenuity and experimentation abound there, which is why our Boulder brewery acts as our experimental brewhouse. It’s where we explore the unknown to bring you the best beer possible. We’re constantly pushing the limits of beer making in order to craft you something that is worthy of your time. In fact, we test over 150 beers each year and only a select few are released nationally.

Collaborations open a world of possibilites, Cheers! and Kippis!

History[edit]




The BJ's in Hillsboro, Oregon


BJ's was founded in 1978 and first opened in Orange County, California. By 1996, seven restaurants had opened between San Diego and Los Angeles. Originally known as Chicago Pizza, the company went public about 1996, raising $9.4 million.[1] The company then bought 26 Pietro's Pizza restaurants in March 1996 in a $2.8 million deal in cash and assumed debt, but then sold off seven of the locations with plans to convert the remaining Pietro's to what was then BJ's Pizza.[1] Between 2010 and 2011, the National Retail Federation named it as one of the 10 fastest growing restaurants in the U.S. based on year-over-year sales.[2] BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. owns and operates 192 restaurants of April 2017,[3] located the 24 states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington. BJ's currently operates 6 breweries located in Reno, NV, Temple, TX, Brea, CA, West Covina, CA and Boulder, CO.
