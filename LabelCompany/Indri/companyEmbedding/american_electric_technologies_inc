North America Variable Frequency Drive Market to Reach US$ 7.70 Billion by 2027 – satPRnews



























Skip to content

PR Distribution

















Posted on July 19, 2017 by Abhishek BudholiyaNorth America Variable Frequency Drive Market to Reach US$ 7.70 Billion by 2027 

The North America variable frequency drive market is projected to reach US$ 7.79 Bn in revenues by 2027, according to a new research by Future Market Insights. In terms of volume, 6.25 million units of variable frequency drivers are expected to be sold in North America in 2017. The U.S. will continue to dominate sales, accounting for nearly 78% revenue share of the market.
According to Future Market Insights, the key factors fuelling the growth of the market include,
Increasing emphasis on energy efficiency: Process engineers are adopting energy-saving devices to reduce operational expenses. For example, in 2015, Len Busch Roses, one of the largest nurseries for cut-stem flowers, deployed variable frequency drive to regulate airflow in snapdragon greenhouse with better precision.
 
Introduction of general purpose variable frequency drives that are compatible with existing motors is reducing impediments to widespread adoption.
 
Variable frequency drives are being employed in a wide range of end-use applications. Installation of variable frequency drives, along with a flow metre, results in energy savings.
Although Future Market Insights maintains a positive outlook on the North America variable frequency drives market, few challenges can restrain growth. These include technical anomalies associated with variable frequency drives and high initial costs of medium voltage variable frequency drives.

AC Drive Most Sought-After 
By drive type, Future Market Insights has segmented the market into AC drive, DC drive, and Servo drive. Among these, AC drives remain the sought-after device, accounting for nearly 72% revenue share of the market in 2016. While 4.20 million units of AC drives were sold in North America in 2016, collective sales of DC drives and servo drives accounted for 1.64 million units.
Low Voltage Range Drives in Demand 
By voltage range, Future Market Insights offers market forecast and analysis on low voltage range and medium voltage range. End-users in North America prefer low voltage range variable frequency drives, with this segment accounting for over 80% revenue share in 2016.
Low Demand for Regenerative Variable Frequency Drives 
By application type, Future Market Insights has segmented the variable frequency drive market into standard and regenerative. Demand for standard variable frequency drives is higher than regenerative variable frequency drives. The former accounted for over 88% revenue share of the market in 2016.
The key end-use application segments of variable frequency drives are,
Pump, Fan, Compressor, Conveyor, HVAC, ,Other applications .
 
 
 
 
 
Pumps Largest End-use Application Segment 
According to Future Market Insights, pumps are the largest end-use application segment, accounting for nearly 35% revenue share of the market in 2016. In 2016, demand for variable frequency drives from this segment was 1.90 billion units.
