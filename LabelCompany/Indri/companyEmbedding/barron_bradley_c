Good morning. My name is Blair, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to NuStar Energy and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.
Chris Russell, you may begin your conference.
Christopher C. Russell - Vice President - Investor Relations and Treasurer
Thank you, Blair. Good morning and welcome, everybody, to today's call. On the call today are Brad Barron, NuStar Energy L.P. and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC's President and CEO; and Tom Shoaf, Executive Vice President and CFO, along with other members of our management team.
Before we get started, we'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, NuStar management will make statements about our current views concerning the future performance of NuStar that are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the various risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
During the course of this call, we'll also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures. Reconciliations of certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP may be found in our earnings press release with additional reconciliations located on the Financials page of the Investors section of our websites.
Now, let me turn the call over to Brad.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you can see from the results we released this morning, we had another great quarter and we covered our distribution yet again, even with continued volatility in the crude markets, turnaround activity at some of our customers' refineries and an unprecedented amount of rainfall in South Texas.
Despite the rainfall as well as operational issues at third-party gas processing plant during the quarter, we experienced increased throughput volumes in the Corpus Christi, an average – a record of 193,000 barrels per day into our North Beach terminal, which benefited both the pipeline and storage segments.
We also set another single-day loading record of 860,000 barrels across our docks in June. Total Eagle Ford volumes increased from about 218,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2014 to around 272,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015. If crude oil prices remain at current levels, we still expect these throughput volumes to increase but more modestly in the back half of the year.
Now, let me spend a few minutes updating you on some of our internal growth projects. At our last investor conference in May, we discussed six projects that are currently under development to increase distillate and propane supply throughout the Upper Midwest. Those include a project to build an eight-mile, eight-inch pipeline at our Conway, Kansas facility and an expansion at our Rock Rapids, Iowa terminal for additional propane supply to CHS, one of our largest Central East region customers.

We expect to complete the CHS propane supply project by the end of this year and the remainder of the projects are scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2017. In May, we began filling our 12-inch pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Corpus Christi, Texas with propane and began operating the system.
Unfortunately, shortly after starting up the line, we experienced a pressure reduction, and upon investigation, we identified an area of unexpected localized corrosion. We have suspended propane delivery service, and we are conducting further assessments. Our current estimate is that we should have the line back in full service in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Turning to Corpus Christi, we remain on schedule to complete construction of 400,000 barrels of additional storage at our North Beach terminal in the third quarter. This additional storage will provide our customers with the flexibility to segregate and deliver processed condensate across our docks.
In addition, we announced earlier this week that the Port of Corpus Christi approved a lease that will give us the space to develop another private marine and loading dock at our North Beach Terminal. We're currently developing plans for the new dock, which will be designed to load up the Suezmax-class vessels at rates up to 30,000 barrels per hour and the ability to expand to 50,000 barrels per hour. Once completed, this new dock would give us access to four loading docks in the Port of Corpus Christi, including two private docks, and allow us to load crude ships simultaneously on all four docks at a maximum rate close to 100,000 barrels per hour. Early estimates provide for completion of this fourth dock in the second quarter of 2017.
With regard to our proposed joint venture with PMI, we realize that this process is taking longer than anticipated, but both PMI and NuStar remain committed to developing the new pipeline infrastructure to transport LPGs and refined products from the U.S. into Northern Mexico. We hope to finalize those agreements in the third quarter.
Beyond the projects just mentioned, we continue to actively look for ways to further expand our operations within the Eagle Ford, and beyond the Eagle Ford into the Permian Basin, as well as to increase our storage capacity at some of our large terminal facilities.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Tom Shoaf, NuStar's Executive Vice President and CFO, so he can provide you with some additional detail on second quarter results. Tom?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2015, we reported EBITDA from continuing operations of $143 million compared to $140 million for the same period last year. EPU for the second quarter of 2015 came in at $0.54 per unit, which was at the high end of the guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per unit that we provided on last quarter's call.
DCF from continuing operations available to limited partners for the quarter was $1.18 per unit, which exceeded our guidance range of $1 to $1.10 per unit and covered the distribution to limited partners by 1.08 times.
During our segment performance, EBITDA in our pipeline segment increased to $86 million, which is $6 million higher than the second quarter of 2014. Total revenues for the segment increased 4% mainly due to the continued strength of our South Texas crude oil pipeline system.
Additionally, operating expenses for the segment decreased 4% compared to the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decrease in power and maintenance costs for that period. Crude oil pipeline throughputs were up 10% compared to the second quarter of 2014, mainly due to a 25% increase in Eagle Ford throughputs compared to the same period last year.

During the quarter, total Eagle Ford volumes increased from about 218,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2014 to around 272,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015, while volumes strictly into our Corpus Christi North Beach terminal and ultimately across our docks increased 29% from 149,000 barrels per day to about 193,000 barrels per day, which was our highest quarterly average to date.
Strong Eagle Ford throughputs were partially offset during the quarter by turnaround activity and unplanned operational issues at some of the refineries served by our crude oil pipelines. Throughputs on our refined products pipelines decreased 4% to 499,000 barrels per day mainly due to increased turnaround activity, lower demand on our East system and unfavorable weather and operational related issues on our ammonia line.
Our storage segment generated $84 million of EBITDA, up $8 million from the second quarter of 2014. Throughput revenues increased 11%, which continue to benefit from increased Eagle Ford crude volumes shipped on the South Texas pipeline system. Storage revenues were up 8%, mainly due to increased revenues from us now owning 100% of the Linden terminal. Our fuels marketing segment earned $3 million of EBITDA during the quarter, down $2 million compared to the second quarter of 2014 mainly due to lower margins and sales volumes across the segment.
NuStar G&A expenses were $27 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter of 2014, due in part to the expiration of the asphalt JV services agreement on June 30, 2014. Our interest expense net of interest of income was $33 million compared to the same quarter last year. Our June 30 debt balance was $3.1 billion while our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.3 times. On July 23, NuStar Energy's board of directors declared a second quarter distribution of $1.095 per unit, which will be paid on August 13. NuStar GP Holdings' board also declared a second quarter distribution of $0.545 per unit, which will be paid on August 17.
Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our projections for the third quarter and full year 2015. In the third quarter, we expect results to be negatively impacted by maintenance and turnaround activity at some of our customers' refineries and reduce throughput volume projections on some of our pipeline systems. We also expect maintenance and reliability capital spending to increase as we get into the back half of the year.
Third quarter EBITDA results in the pipeline segment should be slightly higher than the third quarter of 2014 and second quarter of 2015, while EBITDA results in the storage segment should be higher than the third quarter of 2014 but lower than the second quarter of 2015. We expect third quarter EBITDA results in our fuels marketing segment to be lower than the third quarter of 2014 and comparable to the second quarter of 2015.
During the third quarter of 2015, we expect G&A expenses to be in the range of $25 million to $27 million, depreciation and amortization expense to be around $53 million, and interest expense of approximately $34 million. Based on these projections, third quarter 2015 earnings per unit should be in the range of about $0.50 to $0.60 per unit while distributable cash flow from continuing operations per limited partner unit should be in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 per unit.
With regard to the segment EBITDA guidance for the full-year 2015, we now expect our pipeline segment EBITDA to be $25 million to $45 million higher than 2014 due to reduced volume projections for the remainder of the year.
Our storage segment EBITDA is now projected to be $20 million to $40 million higher than 2014 due to higher-than-expected storage throughputs in the first half of the year and favorable renewals at several of our terminals. We continue to expect 2015 EBITDA results in our fuels marketing segment to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million.

With regard to 2015 strategic capital spending, we now expect spending in the $430 million to $450 million range, which includes both internal growth projects and acquisition spending. 2015 reliability capital spending is now projected to be $35 million to $45 million.
And now let me turn it back over to Brad for any final remarks.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Tom. We're pleased with our solid second quarter and our year-to-date results. And where there may be challenges in the second half of the year, we still expect to cover the distribution for the full-year 2015 with the coverage ratio comparable to that of 2014. And we continue to focus on growing our core fee-based storage and pipeline operations as well as our distributable cash flow through organic internal growth projects and synergistic acquisitions.
At this time, I'll turn it over to the operator and we can open it up for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Zarahn from Barclays. Your line is open.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
On EBITDA guidance. Can you give a little more color on the change in the mix a little bit on the crude pipeline – on the pipeline segment? Is it – any impact from the Belvieu to Corpus NGL line? And is it – any impact also for the lower crude prices? And then, on the storage side of things, is it across the board crude and refined product storage or – a little more color on better results from that business?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. On the pipeline segment, it's both those things. There's some from Mont Belvieu and there's some from just commodity prices and throughputs in general in South Texas, which we expect to go up, just not as rapidly as they have been going up. And I'll let Danny talk a little bit about the storage segment.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Storage segment were very still but very highly utilized across the segment. I think we're right at 98% utilized, but some of the contracts that we've been renewing, specifically lately at St. James, Linden and Amsterdam have been stronger than we were predicting. But it's really kind of across the board strong renewals in that segment.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
But on the renewal, the rates are a little bit better than we thought. Were you able to have a longer duration or is it similar duration whenever you're contracting for those facilities?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Similar durations. We're – right now, I think we have, let's see if I can find the number for you, we're right at 20%, 25%, 28% of our storage lease contracts are inside the year of exploration. About 52% are one to three years and about 20% are three years or greater.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And then looking at some of your growth projects, is Pemex, is that more of an update in the third quarter? Do you think the project will be finalized in the third quarter?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We believe it'll be finalized. And we know it's taken a long time to get that done. A lot of that has to do with – we're really not negotiating commercial terms with PMI right now, but a lot of the delay I think has had to do with our JV partners, PMI negotiations with their customer who is Pemex.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then on the Corpus stock expansion, is that anticipated to be more for crude or are you positioning more for condensate or just it could be flexibility for either?

Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Flexibility for either.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then the last one for me on the guidance for CapEx. Was the modest increase in expansion CapEx more for the new propane project? And then on maintenance, is that just more of a timing issue?
Christopher C. Russell - Vice President - Investor Relations and Treasurer
Brian, this is Chris Russell. On the maintenance side, that's more of a timing issue. Some of the projects just got deferred into next year. On the strategic side, we're building some tanks at St. James that we didn't have. We've got those capital costs in the forecast now. We didn't have those in there initially. And we've also got a couple more tanks at Corpus that we've included in the strategic capital for this year.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then on St. James, what's the – since that's now a definite project, what's the expansion?
Christopher C. Russell - Vice President - Investor Relations and Treasurer
It's a couple of tanks that we're building down there. I'm not sure what the volume is. Danny, do you know?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Yeah. It's 600,000 or 700,000 barrels between the two tanks. Those should go into service in the first half of next year of
Unknown Speaker
It's two 363s.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And so that gets you close to about 10 million barrels in St. James?
Christopher C. Russell - Vice President - Investor Relations and Treasurer
Right.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Right.
Brian Joshua Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
You bet.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Steve Sherowski from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Apologies if I missed this. But is there any way you could quantify what the volume impact on the crude lines was from the floods in third-party processing plants being down in the second quarter?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
That's kind of hard to do. But I think it probably cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 barrels a day to 10,000 barrels a day starting around the end of May through the first half of July or the first week or so of July.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. Okay. That helps. And for storage renewals, any way you can talk about roughly what rate on average you're seeing or what percentage you're seeing in terms of the increase in rates on like a weighted average basis?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
No. I don't really have that. It's so different from location to location. I don't have that in front of me right now. Maybe we could get you some of that. I don't have that in front of me.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. No, fair enough. And just a quick final question. What type of returns are you targeting for your new Corpus terminal? And can you comment on the CapEx spending?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
No. I really don't think we can comment yet. We're still working on the final engineering on that project. As you saw earlier this week, we've got the lease signed with the port. We filed for permits. We're working with the Army Corps of Engineers. We've had initial drawings submitted, some initial engineering, but we've still got a little bit of work to do on the engineering of that project.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. And is that project going to be backstopped by volume commitments from customers or just how are the contracts going to be structured?

Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
It will be backstopped by commitments from customers.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
You bet.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Good morning.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I was wondering, given the improvement in storage conditions that you – storage markets that you talked about, if you could comment on Piney Point and what you're seeing there.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Not a lot at Piney Point. That's strictly a contango terminal. We're watching that very closely, staying in contact with some of our customers who would be interested in that. The steepness of the contango curve has just not been sufficient to warrant that interest yet. We have – basically, we have that terminal mothballed right now. It costs us very little to keep that terminal mothballed, just waiting for the right market conditions.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
That makes sense. And it might be a difficult question to answer, but just wanted to see if you could provide any general thoughts on project potential upstream of the dock, or what does new – with what you just talked about the Corpus, what could be the growth opportunity off that?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
The dock is supported by a project upstream that would involve both pipe and storage, but it's too early to comment on that project right now.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. And could there be further upside even or what the magnitude of the impact could be if the export ban were to be changed?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Absolutely. Absolutely. But this project will – in fact, I think Brad mentioned it in his notes, but this project already and starting in August will allow for a segregated stream of processed condensate all the way through our system to and through North Beach.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. That's helpful. And then just one last one for me. There's been some notable M&A deals announced in the MLP space recently and discussion of sector consolidation appears to be picking up. Do you see NuStar participating in this trend? I was just curious as to your appetite to engage in M&A. Do you see NS as more of a buyer or a seller or any thoughts there?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Obviously, ourselves is more of a buyer than a seller. In terms of the trend, yeah, I mean, it's obvious that there is consolidation taking place, and we're always on the lookout for good deals. We prefer to grow organically and – but at some point, we will – and we're always actually looking for synergistic acquisitions.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Reichman from Simmons. Your line is open.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Good morning. I just wanted to go back – someone had asked about the guidance in the pipeline segment. I just wanted to go back and revisit that a little bit. Last quarter, it seemed like you kind of raised your expectations in terms of the EBITDA contributions from the pipeline segment and now you've kind of moved it back to what's kind of your older expectations. And so, with the refined products, the turnaround doesn't seem like that would have much of a – probably have much of a revenue impact. So, just looking at the crude oil pipeline throughputs, what's your expectation, I mean, in terms of the crude oil throughput? I guess, what I'm kind of looking for is just little more specifics with how you might expect to end the year on just the crude oil pipelines? And just kind of specifically, what the driver is for the lowered expectations?

Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Yeah. Basically, we – this is Danny Oliver by the way. We still expect our crude volumes to grow through the end of the year. Just given the current price deck, we've assumed that that growth may be a little bit more modest than we have had expected last quarter. Of course, that's still subject to change. I can't predict the price of crude oil but the basis – that's what's behind the change in the guidance as far as the crude pipelines go.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
And when you're talking about growth, you were at, what, 506.3 barrels per day in the first quarter. Are you talking about from the average in 2014 or would you expect to finish at the end of the year higher or lower than the first quarter volumes?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
So it's really all about our South Texas Crude System, the Eagle Ford barrels.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Right.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
So we expect the second half of 2015 to grow versus the first half of 2015 and certainly for many period in 2014. We've just leveled out some of that – some of our growth expectations in the second half of this year.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
So I had it like roughly around 550. I mean, would that be a reasonable expectation or -?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Are you talking strictly crude, Mark?
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Yeah. Just crude oil pipeline.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That's probably a little aggressive.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Little aggressive. Okay. That was kind of a year-end run rate. Okay. That's helpful. And then on – I was just thinking, because actually the quarter came in pretty much in line with at least my expectations. And so a lot of this was already kind of known in the first quarter when you kind of raised your expectations and now you're lowering them. So I just didn't know if there was something drastically changed other than just – is it just primarily volumes -?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
It's just volumes. But what's changed since the first quarter is now we're sitting on $50 crude.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Well, yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, clearly. And then I wanted to also ask a little bit about the deal with CHS. That looks like a positive – kind of incremental positive project, maybe not as big a deal as the expansion of the dock space down in Corpus. But could you just provide a little more color on that particular project? And are there any other opportunities to expand along with that co-ops business?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
I believe there is. We continue to talk – we have a very good relationship with CHS. We continue to talk to them about opportunities to help them out as they grow their business up there. Our current, I'll call it, a basket of projects is really six different projects, but they all have to do with either increasing propane supply up into the northern part of the system coming out of Conway or increasing refined products through peak periods in their peak demand seasons up into the northern part of that system. But all six of those projects are incremental or will provide incremental EBITDA to us. And as Brad mentioned, some of the propane project should come online here in the fourth quarter – we believe early in the fourth quarter of this year and the rest in the first quarter of 2017.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International

Okay. And then just one last item. When you reported your earnings in the last quarter, was the FERC pipeline adjustment, was that pretty much in line with your expectations in terms of the tariff increase that you got beginning July 1, I mean, at that time?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Yes. Yeah, it was.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
You're welcome.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, fellas. Just kind of circling back to the CHS question from just a second ago, I believe you guys referenced sort of a $50 million sort of number for CapEx regarding that project first – I mean, not if you correct me if I'm wrong there. But just wondering how that – or how we should use that kind of going from propane to obviously the remainder of the project that don't hit into 2017. Just trying to see how that contribution works its way through. What the step change is really 2016 versus 2017?
Christopher C. Russell - Vice President - Investor Relations and Treasurer
Yeah. Cory, this Chris Russell. The EBITDA multiple is going to be our normal 2016 EBITDA multiple. I would say maybe a third of that CapEx comes online with the propane system in late 2015 and then the remaining two-thirds kind of ratchets up the last half of 2016 and early 2017.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. And then also sort of switching focus from a bigger picture strategic standpoint and obviously potentially broadening your guys' reach, I know you guys referenced sort of the Permian in the past. Should we be thinking about if there is any project opportunity set there, it'll be more crude-related or is there even some NGL type of angles that you guys are exploring there?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We're looking at both. And if you know anything about the Permian, it is the sort of the granddaddy of all the shale plays. And we think there's a lot of opportunity on multiple fronts with the Permian. So we're investigating several projects there.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just if we could step back bigger picture, just given the kind of commodities price environment we're in, just bigger picture, maybe longer term in terms of your opportunity set that you're looking at, I mean, are you seeing it stay about the same? Are you seeing it fall off a bit, seeing it rise a bit? Maybe if you could just comment directionally how that's looking?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say it's probably about the same. We have great relationships with really good customers, particularly in the Eagle Ford. And so I think there's more business to be done – to be built around those customers there. So we're looking at several projects there. So it is a challenging environment, but we do think there's still opportunity.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. So would it – kind of the CapEx run rate you're at right now, would that be pretty fair going forward the next couple of years would you say?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's what we'd like to target.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Okay. Great. Thanks. That's all I had. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Selman Akyol from Stifel. Your line is open.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the pipeline segment real quick, in terms of your operational expenses for this quarter, is that a good run rate just going through the rest of the year the way you see things ramping up?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm sorry. You mean, as far as throughputs go, Selman?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, OpEx -
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
OpEx -
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
On the OpEx expense, the $36 million?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
OpEx, we're probably going to see our maintenance expense pick up in the back half of the year, specifically in the pipeline segment. But OpEx in the storage segment should be pretty, pretty flat going forward I would think.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. And then, could you give a little more color in terms of in and around your corrosion issues and how much pipeline was affected? And then I guess what are you doing in terms of looking at the rest of the line? It seems like if it was a small piece that would come back on maybe a little bit quicker. So I'm just wondering how big of an issue is it do you think you have on this pipeline?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Like I said, we had an issue there. We've investigated it. We're conducting further assessments. And it's going to take a while to get that data in. So we'll know more, later in the year.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, in terms of – did you guys say how far you are through your CapEx budgets? How much you've incurred so far in terms of the $400 million to $450 million?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We did earlier -
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Year-to-date.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We've spent – that $430 million to $450 million includes $140 million we spent on Linden. And then, we've spent about so if we backed that out. Selman, that leaves about $300 million to be spent on internal growth projects. And of that $300 million, we've spent about $140 million of that through the first half of the year.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So -
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We're about halfway through the internal growth projects.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Got you.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
– in terms of the guidance.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, I guess, last kind of questions from me. But in terms of just looking at the balance sheet and everything, in terms of financing, the rest of this – can you just remind me on what your plans are for that?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, right now, I think we have some anticipated equity possibly in the back half of the year. I'm still looking at and it's not imminent that we would need to issue any equity in the back half of the year. It's a very fine line there for us in terms of whether we'll need it or not. No real debt capital markets plans at this time for 2015. So, maybe a little equity. That's a big if. We're not really sure yet, but no debt.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. Do you have an ATM in place?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we filed a shelf registration for the ATM. We renewed an old one that we had and we're in the process of putting an ATM out there, which we expect to do in the third quarter.

Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.

Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have one question on the New York Harbor acquisition and the rest of your JV, can you just talk a little bit about what – how those assets are performing now that you have the full – you have sort of full control over the entire asset base?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Sure. It's performing very well. In fact, we've renewed some contracts in Linden that are a little better than we were anticipating. We're also working – in early stages of working a project for an expansion in that facility, which – hopefully, we have more to say about that maybe around the end of this year or early next year.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
So, would the scope of that expansion be more product storage or more dock capacity. What's sort of the demand from customers for additional services?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's more of product storage and we have sufficient capacity on our docks there to handle the expansion that we're contemplating.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. So the docks aren't – when you say the docks aren't being fully utilized because of maybe you're not having as much storage as you'd like or how would you describe it?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Correct. Correct.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And with that, if you increase the storage, I mean, what's the thing with the dock capacity there? What's the percentages being utilized right now and what could it be going forward?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, it's probably 50% to 60% now. So we've got room for additional storage across those docks.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Got you. And as I understood, the last question on the ATM. So, right now you're not – you haven't issued any equity under your old ATM program. Is that right or -?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, we didn't. It was just a tiny bit that was done few years ago, but no. Effectively no. We really haven't issued anything under it.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Louis Shamie from Zimmer Partners. Your line is open.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners LP
Hi. Good morning, everyone. So my question was just mostly around the Corpus Christi potential dock expansion. I just wanted a little bit more of a broad deal of what's going on around there, how it relates with the sort of Phase 2 of your Eagle Ford project? And put it in the context of potential competition, lot other midstream guys have infrastructure in that area and they've got similar projects. So, sort of where do you stand with that in the competitive landscape?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
I think we have probably the greatest capacity to load Eagle Ford crude out in the Corpus area. Our customers experience very little demurrage or time waiting on a dock. As Brad mentioned in his notes, we've been setting records of almost – single-day records, almost 900,000 barrels. That's very important when you have several ships show up at the same time and want to get their crude out. But again, that's why we're very busy in Corpus now and utilizing our docks. We do have some expansion plans that we're working on. And it's nice to be able to grow these pipeline demands and things like that, but you have to take care of business at the dock or it just doesn't all work.

Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners LP
So the idea would be that you'd come up with some plans and then go into an open season or something like that to market it?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
It may or may not involve an open season, but we do have some definite, specific expansion projects that we're working in the Eagle Ford right now.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners LP
Got it. Can you talk a little bit about what the potential capital spend would be for those plans?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
It's a little early for that.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners LP
Okay. And then the last thing I wanted to ask about was the St. James rail facility. What have you guys been seeing there and what's your expectation of how that performs over next few years?
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
It's hard to talk about expectations because the LLS spreads vary and we certainly saw on the first half of this year those spreads were almost flat to WTI to LSS. And those volumes in St. James went to basically nothing or down to our contract minimums. But we've seen here just in the last couple of months is those spreads have improved, and we've seen some incremental volume coming back over those systems.
Louis Shamie - Zimmer Partners LP
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Daniel S. Oliver - Senior VP-Business & Corporate Development
Good.

Your next question comes from the line of Lin Shen from HITE. Your line is open.
Lin Shen - HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC
Hey, good morning. Just – we have a quick question about Corpus Christi. Just wondering like what are the current destination to receive crude or products from your Corpus Christi dock now? And do you think that their same destination will be used to have enough capacity to receive your expansion project?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right now, ships leave our Corpus Christi facility and they head up the coast to refining centers in Houston. They head up to Louisiana. Some of the ships head up to Canada. So I would think – and I think your question further ask, what would happen at the crude export ban. We're lifted. There's a great potential for those ships to go almost anywhere. Mexico has talked about projects with the United States to take U.S. crude into Mexico. We'll be well positioned to handle that crude as well.
Lin Shen - HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Good morning. My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the NuStar Energy L.P. and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session
Thank you. Chris Russell, Treasurer and VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Christopher C. Russell - Treasurer & Head-Investor Relations
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. On the call today are Brad Barron, NuStar Energy L.P. and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC's President and CEO; and Tom Shoaf, Executive Vice President and CFO; along with other members of our management team.
Before we get started, we'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, NuStar management will make statements about our current views concerning the future performance of NuStar that are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the various risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
During the course of this call, we'll also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures. Reconciliations of certain of these non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP may be found in our earnings press release with additional reconciliations located on the Financials page of the Investors section of our websites.
Now, let me turn the call over to Brad.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, 2015 is off to a great start, as we were able to cover our distribution 1.25 times in the first quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that we've covered our distribution.
Let me walk you through some of the positive developments from the first quarter. At the beginning of the year, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in our Linden Terminal joint venture. This immediately accretive transaction had a positive effect on our first quarter results and has already provided synergies with our adjacent wholly-owned terminal.
During the first quarter, we moved record and higher than expected Eagle Ford throughput volumes on our South Texas crude oil pipeline system. The late February completion of an expansion to our South Texas system contributed to these record volumes and increased the throughput capacity of our system to 340,000 barrels per day.
Our storage segment also benefited from record Eagle Ford throughputs during the quarter as our Corpus Christi North Beach Terminal set records for the amount of crude that was loaded across its docks. During the quarter, we loaded an average of approximately 190,000 barrels per day and set a single day loading record of 805,000 barrels in early February.
Although we're pleased with the performance of our South Texas system so far this year, we realized that our throughput volumes could be negatively affected as we progress throughout the remainder of the year if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further. We are cautiously optimistic that throughput levels in the Eagle Ford will remain strong, but remain conservative in our projections given the uncertainty exists in the crude markets.

Now, let me spend a few minutes updating you on some of our internal growth projects. I'm happy to report that we completed construction on our Mont Belvieu 12-inch pipeline conversion project. If you recall, last year we signed a long-term agreement with Occidental Petroleum to ship NGLs on NuStar's currently idled 200-mile 12-inch pipeline between Mont Belvieu and Corpus Christi, Texas. We plan to commence line fill in May.
Earlier this month, we announced that we increased naphtha storage capacity at our Edinburg terminal by 50,000 barrels to accommodate additional grades and volumes. We also extended our agreement with PMI for an additional 10-year to transport naphtha on our Burgos-Valley pipeline system to our Edinburg terminal.
In addition, we continue to work with PMI to finalize the agreements associated with the proposed joint venture and wish the two companies will develop new pipeline infrastructure to transport LPGs and refined products from U.S. into northern Mexico. We hope to finalize the agreement in the second quarter.
In the third quarter this year, we expect to complete the construction of 400,000 barrels of additional storage at our Corpus Christi North Beach Terminal. This additional storage will provide our customers with the flexibility to segregate and store additional grades of crude and condensate.
In addition, we're actively looking for ways to further expand our operations in South Texas and increase our storage capacity at some of our facilities. Further details on these projects will be provided throughout the year as they develop.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Tom Shoaf, NuStar's Executive Vice President and CFO, so he can provide you with some additional detail on our first quarter results.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2015, we reported EBITDA from continuing operations of $214 million and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $158 million. With or without the $56 million gain associated with acquiring the remaining 50% of our Linden Terminal joint venture, EBITDA from continuing operations was the highest first quarter EBITDA ever reported in our history.
2015 DCF from continuing operations available to limited partners covered the distribution to the limited partners by 1.25 times, our highest first quarter distribution coverage since 2008. Adjusted EPU for the first quarter of 2015 improved 111% over the first quarter 2014 EPU to $0.76 per unit from $0.36 per unit, and exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per unit.
DCF from continuing operations available to limited partners for the quarter was $1.37 per unit, 37% higher than the $1 per unit generated in the first quarter of 2014, which again exceeded our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.25 per unit.
Our first quarter results exceeded our guidance expectations, primarily due to higher than expected Eagle Ford throughput volumes, stronger than expected margins in our fuels marketing segment and some foreign exchange gains realized in the first quarter.
During our segment performance, or turning to our segment performance, EBITDA in our pipeline segment to $89 million, which is $18 million higher than the first quarter of 2014. Within the segment, we experienced a 22% increase in total throughputs and a 21% increase in total revenues.
First quarter throughputs on our crude oil pipeline system were up 41% and exceeded 0.5 million barrels per day for the first time in our history due to increased Eagle Ford throughputs and increased crude oil demand at one of our customer's refineries that was in turnaround in early 2014.
Eagle Ford volumes increased 61% from about 180,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of 2014 to around 290,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2015. Throughputs on our refined products pipelines increased 7% to 506,000 barrels per day, benefiting from increased production at a customer's refinery that was in turnaround during last year's first quarter.

Our storage segment generated $78 million of EBITDA, up $10 million from the first quarter 2014. Throughput revenues increased 15%, also benefiting from increased Eagle Ford crude volumes shipped on the South Texas Pipeline System.
Storage revenues were up 13% due to increased revenues from us now owning a 100% of the Linden Terminal, as well as higher lease utilization rates at our St. Eustatius and Point Tupper terminals. These increased revenues were partially offset by reduced unit train activity at our St. James, Louisiana terminal.
Our fuels marketing segment earned $10 million of EBITDA during the quarter, up slightly over the first quarter 2014. Stronger than expected margins on our bunkering operations were mostly offset by challenging market conditions in our heavy fuels trading operations.
NuStar's G&A expenses were $25 million, $4 million higher than the first quarter of 2014, largely due to expiration of the asphalt JV services agreement on June 30, 2014. Our interest expense, net of interest income, was $32 million, down $1 million from last year's first quarter.
Our March 31 debt balance was $3 billion, while our debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.1 times. On April 21, NuStar Energy's board of directors declared a first quarter distribution of $1.095 per unit, which will be paid on May 14. NuStar GP Holdings board also declared a first quarter distribution of $0.545 per unit, which will be paid on May 18.
Now, let me spend a few minutes talking about our predictions for the second quarter and full year 2015. While our first quarter results were very strong, we expect our second quarter results to be negatively impacted by a 30-day turnaround at one of our customers' refineries, as well as seasonal increases in maintenance, operating expenses and reliability capital spending.
Second quarter EBITDA results in the pipeline and storage segments should be higher than the second quarter of 2014, but lower than the first quarter of 2015. We expect second quarter EBITDA results in our fuels marketing segment to be lower than the second quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, as we feel bunkering margins will return to more historic norms.
During the second quarter of 2015, we expect G&A expenses to be in the range of $24 million to $26 million, depreciation and amortization expense to be around $55 million and interest expense of approximately $33 million.
Based on these projections, second quarter 2015 earnings per unit should be $0.45 to $0.55 per unit, while distributable cash flow from continuing operations per limited partner unit should be in the range of $1 to $1.10 per unit.
With regard to segment EBITDA guidance for the full year of 2015, we now expect our pipeline segment EBITDA to be $35 million to $55 million higher than 2014 due to the higher than expected throughputs we experienced on our South Texas Crude Oil Pipeline System in the first quarter of 2015.
Our storage segment EBITDA is still projected to be $10 million to $30 million higher than 2014, while we continue to expect 2015 EBITDA results in our fuels marketing segment to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million.
With regard to 2015 strategic capital spending, we continue to expect spending in the $400 million to $420 million range, which includes internal growth and acquisition spending. 2015 reliability capital spending is now projected to be $45 million to $55 million.
And now with that, let me turn it back over to Brad for any final remarks.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
With a record first quarter behind us and the projections Tom just provided you, we once again expect to cover the distribution for the full year 2015, with a coverage ratio comparable to that in 2014. Even with the uncertainty in the crude markets, we continue to focus on growing our core fee-based storage and pipeline operations that are executing our internal growth capital program, identifying synergistic acquisitions. We expect this strategy to allow us to continue to build strong foundation for DCF growth in the future.

I turn it back over to you, Chris.
Christopher C. Russell - Treasurer & Head-Investor Relations
Okay. Now we're ready to open up to Q&A, John.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Steve Sherowski from Goldman Sachs.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi. Good morning. On the pipeline segment, your South Texas Phase 2 project, did that roughly contribute about half a quarter's worth of cash flow during the first quarter?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Roughly that.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
If I understood that correctly.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's correct.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. And your Houston 12-inch line, when is – that's expected to come on next month, is that correct as well?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's correct. We'll start line fill in May.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. And then, so I guess I'm just trying to drill down on guidance, so you've increased the midpoint of your year-over-year pipeline growth by roughly $10 million, but it looks like first quarter was up about $18 million year-over-year and I recognize that included a partial quarter contribution from the South Texas Phase 2 project and also the Phase 1 project, but it still seems like guidance is pretty conservative, which you alluded to in your opening remarks. I'm just trying to get a sense of, are you expecting throughput on these pipelines on your South Texas system to decline at all during the remaining half of the year, just what are your thoughts that really drove that are behind your guidance and what are you thinking later on in the year in terms of volume growth?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No. We're not expecting any decline in those volumes, although we have tempered the growth that we had originally expected in our budget on those lines. So I think on the Eagle Ford today we're doing right at 300,000 barrels a day average 290,000 barrels in the first quarter. But throughout the remainder of the year, we're expecting about 15,000 barrels a day of growth mostly in the fourth quarter due to some specific customer conversations that we're having. But that's about half of the growth that we had originally anticipated in our budget.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And obviously you had strong coverage this quarter, I guess, you expect full year coverage to be roughly in line with last year, any thoughts on growing your distribution or any changes to how you're thinking about that?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We were taking bets on whether that'd be the first question.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Second question.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Last year this time, the big question was, will we cut the distribution. We've worked our way out of that. And so the first step for us has been to secure the distribution. We feel like we've done that. Now the next step for us particularly in an uncertain market is to increase our distribution coverage ratio. When we feel like that is sufficient then we will entertain a distribution increase. We're not there yet, we're working towards that and that's really about all I can tell you.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick final question. Any thoughts on your potential project backlog. I think your – based on last guidance you're roughly in the $1.2 billion range of potential projects, has that changed at all or just how you're thinking about that?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

About right. I mean, the uncertainty in the crude oil markets makes it more difficult to do some of the big projects that you're looking at. It's harder for producers to want to commit, they don't know what the environment looks like, but we're still confident that we have a lot of good projects out there that are either bolt-on to what we are doing, synergistically what we're doing or maybe even some greenfield project. So, yeah, I'd say that's still a good number.
Steve C. Sherowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. That's it from me. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays Capital.
Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good morning. Following up on the last question about the project backlog, can you just give us an update on your discussion with customers on potentially exporting condensate from Corpus Christi?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. We've got active conversations going on with several of our customers in the Eagle Ford. We are in the process of building some additional storage in our South Texas Crude System that will allow us to segregate that stream. We have several customers that are processing condensate in the field. So we're working towards that goal and hope to be in a situation probably by the end of this year, where we can segregate those volumes for export.
Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. And on the Pemex pipeline project, could you provide us with some additional color on how that's going potentially, what do you think the cost of the project could be?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We haven't given any guidance to that yet. It's a little early. We expect to complete our negotiations in all of the contracts here in the second quarter and then we'll be able to provide a little more color at that point.
Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. And in terms of storage, what are you seeing in terms of the general trends in crude and refined product storage rates for current contract renewals?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think we're minus Piney Point, which is a mothballed facility we have. We're about 99% fully utilized in our storage segment, so it's a healthy market. I think the contango in the crude market has bolstered that segment for us and we're starting to see some indications of strengthening in prices, but it's solid.
Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And last one from me, so in regards to your CapEx guidance, the organic CapEx guidance for full year, can you just give us a sense of what you think that will be in the first quarter? How the cadence of that guidance will be broken out throughout the year?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
First quarter, the strategic capital spending was $68.3 million and then we also had the acquisition of the Linden terminal for another $142.5 million and then our liability spending in the first quarter was $6.8 million.
Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Just kind of want to ask some follow ups on some of the questions that have already been asked. I guess starting with the Pemex contract, I mean, are you guys at the stage where everything in principal is basically been agreed to and it's just lawyers trading paperwork at this point or is there still like an active negotiation actually occurring?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

No, we're really working on finalizing the legal documents, that's where we're at.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So this is just dealing with the government entity and it just always takes longer.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Correct.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just kind of wanted to follow up – just sort of on your guidance for this year and so forth, I mean, I kind of want to know – or I was wondering if you can isolate what in your opinion was somewhat temporary versus what you sort of think about is kind of on an ongoing basis? I mean, do we view this step-up in the pipeline segment is really just sort of a temporary step-up and you know that's why you're sort of hesitant on making more bullish coverage statements and growth statements and so forth?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think – yeah, we can answer that. I think the step-up in pipeline volumes, we expect that to remain steady over the year. I think what we want to convey is that the growth won't be ramping up as fast as what we had budgeted for. In terms of things that could change throughout the year, one big thing is bunker margins were very strong in the first quarter and we see that probably normalizing through the second half of the year. Another thing that contributed to a very strong first quarter is that most of our maintenance CapEx takes place in the second and third. So you have very little of that in the first quarter, you see that ramping up in the second, which will bring it down from the first quite a bit. So, are there other things, Tom?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No, that was pretty much it.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
So...
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We've got customer turnaround in the second quarter as well that will mute the results there.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
So, I mean – so the strong coverage for the quarter is pretty strong. I mean, maybe you take a couple of basis points off for a couple of – a couple of things that worked the right way, but it's still a solid number in your opinion and that's the way we should look at it, correct?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I mean, it was a great quarter and we plan to have a great year. What I'm trying to convey is the second quarter isn't going to be nearly as strong as the first.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That's fair. And then in terms of the distribution growth – and yes, I know you went from – is it going to be there last year to now we're asking about growth and so forth. I was wondering if maybe you can expand a little bit on the sign posts that you're looking for. I think you mentioned you want to build coverage next and so forth. Is there kind of a number that you want to get to coverage wise? Does your net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio also play into that as you triangulate as to when to step forward? Do some of the new projects, do you want to hold back some cash potentially for that? Is retained DCF sort of part of your philosophy now as well? So if you can sort of expand the discussion a little bit as to how we should be thinking about how you're thinking when it finally comes time to raise it?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. I mean, the way we look at it is we need a strong foundation in order to weather any sort of storm. We don't want to live close to the edge on the distribution coverage ratio. So we want to make sure that there's enough cushion built in that we can weather anything that comes our way. What is that number? I can't tell you exactly. Is it 1.07 times? Is it 1.1 times? Who knows. There's not a precise number in mind. Probably the more important thing is we need visibility towards for big streams of DCF coming our way. And as we continue to execute on our projects, those things will develop.

Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Does the fact that you potentially have a lot of project potentially cause you to want to retain DCF and run a higher coverage ratio to help fund that for a period of time? Or you would just sort of view each project on its own merits and raise the equity that's necessary?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No, it's not really about trying to fund the projects. We have plenty of capital to do that. It's more about – some of these projects we have in development that we've talked about, getting those to a point where they are viable, they are working, it's a project that's in construction, and we can see that EBITDA coming in on those projects is going to be imminent.
So once we start bringing some of that backlog into the front and getting some of those projects across the finish line, we've talked about PMI and some others, we can feel a little better about talking about distribution increases.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you very much, guys.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Cory Garcia from Raymond James.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, fellows. Great quarter.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
If we take a look at the St. James market and then perhaps some potentially changing dynamics in that market from a crude standpoint, several of potential projects bringing more the inland shale crude into that market over the next couple of years, what sort of storage expansion opportunities or even sort of participation in other projects should we look at and as we see maybe potentially leveraging that growth of your current and potential St. James assets?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We would expect any one of those changes in the market, maybe the reversal of cap line, some other pipelines coming over from the Beaumont area coming into Louisiana would generate additional storage interest, we're waiting for those to happen. But we do think that any of those would probably generate some additional interest.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So right now it's more of a wait and see as those projects come to fruition?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got you. Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Reichman from Simmons.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Thank you. Just had a couple of questions. First, on the transportation segment, it seems like the operating expenses were at least lower relative to my expectations. Did they come in pretty normal to your expectations or was there something there in terms of lower operating expenses within the transportation segment?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No, I think they came in pretty much along our expectations, Mark.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay. And then on the projects, mainly the naphtha project that was announced, you talked about the agreement was revised with a slight increase in throughput commitment, but you've added roughly, what, 80,000 barrels of storage capacity. Could you just maybe provide some additional color on what the upside to NuStar is within that segment going forward as a result of that contract?
And then with regard to the propane project, I think you'd mentioned in your last call that if you could get an agreement struck within the first quarter that you would expect that project to commence service in the second half of 2016. And so this modest delay in terms of getting the contracts finalize, that has no impact on the timing of the project, right?

Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, let me address your second question first. The propane line is – we're commencing line-fill in May. It will be in service in May.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
He's talking about PMI.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Oh, it's PMI, okay. Yeah, we're out late 2016, early 2017 now on that project going into service. On the naphtha project, basically what happened there is we had an agreement with PMI to – they ship one grade of naphtha, this allows us to ship two different grades. We increased their T&D commitment by 1,000 barrels a day, but the biggest thing is we were able to renew that contract for 10 years.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay. And when you...
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a real upside there.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Yeah. Well, I mean – but in terms of the additional cost of constructing the additional 50,000 barrels of capacity, I mean are the economics better now as a result of your – in terms of the new contract as it applies to your expanded capital commitment to that project?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, because we were able to increase the volumes. Without being able to ship two grades of naphtha, they would have reduced their commitment to us on a volume basis significantly. It's worth about $4.1 million a year.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay, great. And then, I guess lastly, there has been talk about conversion of a bulk terminal in Vancouver in order to receive crude by rail. And I was just wondering where that project stands, if there is any color you can provide there?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We're still working through the permitting process on that. And so there is really not much else to say about other than we're diligently pursuing the permit.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Is the permit – whose – is that Vancouver?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Uh-huh.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay. And then what would be – what type of, I mean, is it premature to talk about maybe the timing of commencement of the service from the point of receiving the permit and in terms of what kind of volumes you might envision?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean I think the volumes there would be fairly small. The project is, currently, the air permit is less than 40,000 barrels a day or 50,000 barrels a day?
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay, okay.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It is less than 50,000 barrels a day.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Okay.
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So as rail projects like that go, it's relatively small.
Mark La France Reichman - Simmons & Company International
Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you very much and good quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Selman Akyol from Stifel.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Couple of quick follow-up questions. As it relates to the pipeline expenses, I mean down pretty sharply from Q4 and I know you've got Phase 2 coming online, you got the NGL pipeline coming online. So is that kind of a base rate and then incremental for those other pipelines coming on?

Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
As far as the base rate goes, Selman, I think, I'm looking real quick, they should increase a little bit as they go through the years, because we're going to have more maintenance cost hit us in the second quarter and the third quarter. So that's probably the low point of the year, to be honest with you, as far as OpEx goes.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay.
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
As Brad said earlier, our maintenance tends to pick up in the second and third quarters and so we should be higher as we go through the year.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, previously on Piney Point, you said that storage just really works in a contango market. I was just kind of wondering what's going on with that asset right now?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, it's still currently mothballed. We still don't have any contango on the gasoline side. The contango on the distillate side is not very steep. The last time I looked a few days ago, I think it was about $0.50 a barrel per month. That's not going to pay for time value of money alone, much less storage. So the markets have improved, they're just not quite there to generate that kind of interest yet.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right, thanks. And then last one. Maintenance capital, looks like it's up at the midpoint slightly from your previous guidance. Anything going on there?
Thomas R. Shoaf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We just increased the amount of our API 653 tank maintenance work. We've got some tanks coming on that need scheduled maintenance this year, so we increased the spending because of that.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
All right. Thanks very much.

Congrats on the strong quarter there. Thanks for all the color this morning. I just want to go, touch on the M&A market and see if the Linden Terminal, if that was just kind of a one-off opportunity or if you guys were exploring that now and do you see opportunities out there or are bid/ask spreads pretty wide, any thoughts on that would be helpful?
Bradley C. Barron - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The sellers' expectations are still fairly high on some of the stuff. So we're actively looking for good bolt-on acquisitions that are synergistic with our current operations. We're not looking to step outside of what we currently do. So it needs to be synergistic to what we have in our current expertise, but we are actively looking all the time.
