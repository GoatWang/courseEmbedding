Professional Designations




About Us
Professional Designations
 



 
Dowling & Yahnke boasts a team of professionals who adhere to the highest standard in customer service and industry knowledge. Accordingly, our staff has earned a number of industry certifications that confirm their level of knowledge and understanding.


CFA - Chartered Financial Analyst

The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation is a globally respected, graduate-level investment credential established in 1962 and awarded by the CFA Institute, the largest global association of investment professionals.
There are currently more than 135,000 CFA charterholders working in 150 countries. To earn the CFA designation, candidates must (1) pass three sequential, six-hour examinations, (2) have at least four years of qualified professional investment experience, (3) join the CFA Institute as members, and (4) commit to abide by, and annually reaffirm, their adherence to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.
High Ethical Standards
The CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct, enforced through an active professional conduct program, requires CFA charterholders to:

Place their clients' interests ahead of their own


Maintain independence and objectivity


Act with integrity


Maintain and improve their professional competence


Disclose conflicts of interest and legal matters

Global Recognition
Passing the three CFA exams is a difficult feat that requires extensive study (successful candidates report spending an average of 300 hours of study at each level). Earning the CFA charter demonstrates mastery of many of the advanced skills needed for investment analysis and decision-making in today's quickly evolving global financial industry. As a result, employers and clients are increasingly seeking CFA charterholders, often making the charter a prerequisite for employment.
Additionally, regulatory bodies in 28 countries recognize the CFA charter as a proxy for meeting certain licensing requirements. More than 300 colleges and universities around the world have incorporated a majority of the CFA Program curriculum into their own finance courses.
Comprehensive and Current Knowledge
The CFA Program curriculum provides a comprehensive framework of knowledge for investment decision making and is firmly grounded in the knowledge and skills used every day in the investment profession. The three levels of the CFA Program test proficiency in a wide range of fundamental and advanced investment topics, including ethical and professional standards, fixed-income and equity analysis, alternative and derivative investments, economics, financial reporting standards, portfolio management, and wealth planning.
The CFA Program curriculum is updated every year by experts from around the world to ensure that candidates learn the most relevant and practical new tools, ideas, and investment management skills to reflect the dynamic and complex nature of the profession.

CPA - Certified Public Accountant

Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is the statutory title of qualified accountants in the United States who have passed the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (Uniform CPA Exam) and have met additional state education and experience requirements for certification as a CPA. The CPA was established in law in 1896. The requirements for licensure as a CPA, which are set by each state board of accountancy, include completing a program of study in accounting at a college or university, passing the Uniform CPA Exam, and obtaining a specific amount of professional work experience in public accounting (the required amount and type of experience varies according to licensing jurisdiction).
One of the world’s leading licensing examinations, the Uniform CPA Examination, serves to protect the public interest by helping to ensure that only qualified individuals become licensed as CPAs. The Uniform CPA Exam is set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and administered by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy. Eligibility to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam is determined by individual state boards of accountancy. Typically, the requirement is a U.S. bachelor’s degree including a minimum number of qualifying credit hours in accounting and business administration with an additional one year study.
The subject matter areas covered by the Uniform CPA Exam include:

Auditing and Attestation - Planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.


Financial Accounting and Reporting - Concepts and standards for financial statements, typical items in financial statements, specific types of transactions and events, accounting and reporting for governmental agencies, and accounting and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.


Regulation - Ethics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.


Business Environment and Concepts - Business structures, economic concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.

The Uniform CPA Exam tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as auditing and accounting standards, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all U.S. jurisdictions or are federal in nature.
Ethics and Continuing Professional Education (CPE)
Over 40 of the state boards of accountancy now require applicants for CPA status to complete a special examination on ethics. Many states require that the ethics course include a review of that state's specific rules for professional practice.
CPAs are required to take continuing education courses in order to renew their license. Requirements vary by state, but the majority of states require 120 hours of CPE every three years with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course during every renewal period.
