LanguagesEnglishRecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Bruce R.:Bruce has "coached me up" in a number of areas which I greatly appreciate.  He can quickly assess the business & technology  situation at hand and provide sound and actionable advise.  He can work effectively with early-stage entrepreneurs as well as well-capitalized companies and help them define that 'next level' as well as get you there.See moreSee lessBruce was CEO of TurnKey Solutions from 2005 thru 2010, which was a very instrumental and formulative period in TurnKey’s history.  TurnKey transitioned from a purely services company in the automated testing space to a balanced products/services offering firm during this period, and Bruce was instrumental in sheparding our company through this phase.  Bruce knew the targets that we needed to hit on our software goals, and provided core knowledge about how to achieve those targets from both a product and services perspective that helped us to navigate the difficult waters from our prior life to the company that we now are.  A significant part of our success then and now is based upon our strategic partnerships, and Bruce was invaluable in negotiating and working without both our primary partner and our secondary partners in achieving our targeted market position, as well as working through the inevitable ebs and flows of relationship management.  Bruce provided both a highly professional and capable face and management interface to our partners, allowing us to grow successfully through the very difficult company transformation and growth stages that we built upon for our current market-leading success.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended Bruce R.View Bruce R.’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Bruce R. directlyView Bruce R.’s Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishPeople Also ViewedMark DreherManaging Principal at Inflection Point PartnersMichelle BarbossaSales Representative ~ Leviton Mfg.

Vermillion Appoints Bruce A. Huebner as Interim Chief Executive Officer

Posted on November 30, 2012  by  glowtouch 


AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 27, 2012 — /PRNewswire/ — Vermillion, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRML), a molecular diagnostics company focused on ovarian cancer and vascular medicine, appointed director Bruce A. Huebner as interim chief executive officer. He succeeds Gail S. Page, who will assist in the transition and serve as a strategic advisor to the company as requested by its board of directors. Huebner will continue to serve on Vermillion’s board of directors.
As previously announced, the company’s board formed a succession committee of independent directors to oversee the process of identifying and selecting a new CEO. It has also retained a leading executive search firm with experience in CEO transitions to advise the board on potential candidates.
“With more than 37 years of diagnostic industry experience and leadership, as well as serving on a special Vermillion board committee that evaluates marketing strategies for OVA1®, Bruce will provide seasoned leadership as our interim CEO,” said James S. Burns, the company’s chairman of the board. “He will actively manage the business and ensure continuity of operations, as our succession committee searches for a new CEO who will take the company to its next level of growth and development.
“I would also like to thank Gail for the leadership and dedication that she has provided in bringing OVA1 to market and a pipeline of products to improve women’s health. We look forward to consulting with Gail in the coming months as we continue to build advocacy for our ovarian cancer franchise among gynecologists and women’s health groups.”
Huebner has executive management experience in multiple clinical diagnostic companies, including Osmetech Molecular Diagnostics, Nanogen and Gen-Probe. While serving as president of Osmetech, he successfully established the company as a fully integrated business, obtaining FDA clearance for four molecular diagnostic microarray products and introducing them to the marketplace. Huebner was previously president and chief operating officer of Nanogen, a publicly held nanotechnology and microarray company.
Prior to Nanogen, he was executive vice president and chief operating officer of Gen-Probe, a global leader in the development of nucleic acid tests, including diagnostic tests for infectious disease that affect women’s health. In less than 10 years, he grew Gen-Probe’s annual revenues from $42 million to a run-rate of more than $150 million. Huebner is currently a managing director of LynxCom Partners, a healthcare consulting firm with a focus on cancer diagnostics and personalized medicine.
“The appointment of Bruce as interim CEO allows Vermillion additional time to recruit a successor with a strong commercial background in diagnostics,” added Burns. “Given the recent Delaware court’s dismissal of the dissident shareholder suit and admonishment of the plaintiffs, Vermillion can now set a shareholder meeting date, elect a new director, and take the steps necessary to attract and compensate a new CEO.”
About Vermillion Vermillion, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRML) is dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic tests that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for patients. Vermillion, along with its prestigious scientific collaborators, has diagnostic programs in oncology, vascular medicine and women’s health.

Vermillion Appoints Bruce A. Huebner to Chairman of the Board

		  Shareholders to Vote on Approval of Expanded Stock Incentive Plan at Upcoming Annual Meeting

AUSTIN, Texas, March 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Vermillion, Inc. (NASDAQ:   VRML), a molecular diagnostics company focused on gynecologic cancers and women's health, has appointed Bruce A. Huebner as chairman effective March 18, 2013. He succeeds James S. Burns, who will continue to serve on the board of directors. Huebner's appointment represents an important step in the execution of the company's leadership succession plan that began in 2012.  
Huebner previously served as Vermillion's CEO on an interim basis until the recent appointment of Thomas McLain to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer, which also took effect yesterday. Huebner has been a company director since May 2011. 
"Bruce demonstrated highly effective leadership during this transition period," said Burns. "Given his performance, as well as his more than 37 years of diagnostic industry experience and history of valuable contributions as a director, the board believes that the company and its shareholders would greatly benefit from Bruce as our chairman. I look forward to working closely with Bruce and our new president to build shareholder value, as we advance Vermillion as a leading diagnostics company addressing unmet clinical needs in women's health."
Shareholder Vote
At the company's upcoming 2012 annual meeting on March 21, the board will request shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares in the company's 2010 stock incentive plan by 1.3 million shares. 
"The company currently has only nominal shares available under the 2010 stock incentive plan," noted Chairman Huebner. "We will need more shares to attract qualified executives, directors and employees to Vermillion. Without the approval of these additional shares, we will have to increase the cash compensation to these individuals. We would also not have the benefit of incentivized performance that is typically created by a stock option plan, and one that better aligns the interests of management and employees with that of our shareholders. So, it is in the best interest of Vermillion shareholders that we approve the expansion of this plan."

About Vermillion 
Vermillion, Inc. (NASDAQ:   VRML) is dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic tests that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for patients. Vermillion, along with its prestigious scientific collaborators, has diagnostic programs in oncology, vascular medicine and women's health. 
The company's lead diagnostic, OVA1®, is a blood test for pre-surgical assessment of tumors for malignancy, using a unique multi-biomarker approach. In a published clinical trial, OVA1 achieved 99% sensitivity in detecting epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC). This included 96% sensitivity for stage I EOC, the earliest and most curable EOC stage, compared with 57% for the conventional biomarker CA125. In addition, OVA1 found 70% of malignancies missed by non-specialist pre-surgical assessment, and it increased detection of malignancy over ACOG guidelines from 77% to 94%. As the first protein-based, In Vitro Diagnostic Multi-Variate Index Assay (IVDMIA) cleared by the FDA, OVA1 also represents a new class of software-based diagnostics. Additional information about these published clinical trials is available on Vermillion's website at www.vermillion.com.

Xenomics Appoints Bruce A. Huebner as Chief Executive Officer and 
      Board Member




Formation of TrovaGene Subsidiary is First Step in Strategic 
      Refocusing of Development and Partnering Programs






October 06, 2009 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Xenomics, Inc. (Pink Sheets:XNOM.PK)(FWB:XE7) a developer of 
      trans-renal molecular diagnostic technologies, announced today the 
      appointment of Bruce A. Huebner, a veteran of the diagnostics industry, 
      as Chief Executive Officer and board director. Concurrent with Mr. 
      Huebner’s appointment, Xenomics announced the formation of TrovaGene, 
      Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, under the laws of the State of 
      Delaware, and plans to change the name of the company to “TrovaGene.” 
      The planned name change, by statutory merger, will be proposed to 
      shareholders in the next 30 to 60 days. TrovaGene, under Mr. Huebner’s 
      guidance, will be engaged in refocusing the company’s development and 
      partnering programs. The company is pursuing several high value targets 
      using its trans-renal DNA and RNA technology. One application for the 
      detection of HPV in urine was presented this year at ASCO by Dr. David 
      Robbins, VP Research and Development of Xenomics, which compared the 
      Xenomics’ test with the market leading Digene HPV test now owned and 
      marketed by Qiagen. In this study the Xenomics test showed superior 
      sensitivity and specificity to the Digene assay. The company is also 
      pursuing a test for the detection of KRAS mutations in urine samples 
      from patients with colon cancer. The detections of these mutations will 
      provide valuable information to the physician resulting in more optimal 
      treatment decisions for the patient.
    


      Mr. Huebner has over 35 years of experience in the diagnostic industry, 
      and has been a key member of upper management in a number of clinical 
      diagnostic companies including Hybritech, Inc., Gen-Probe, Inc., 
      Nanogen, Inc. and Osmetech Molecular Diagnostics. From 1996 to 2002, he 
      was Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Gen-Probe, 
      Inc. which today is the world leader in diagnostics to detect and 
      monitor sexually transmitted diseases, with a market cap of 
      approximately $2.2 billion dollars. From 2002 to 2004, Mr. Huebner was 
      President and Chief Operating Officer of Nanogen, Inc., a publicly held 
      nanotechnology/microarray company. From 2005 to 2008, Mr. Huebner, as 
      President of Osmetech, successfully established Osmetech as a fully 
      integrated business, obtaining FDA clearance for four molecular 
      diagnostic microarray products and introducing them to the marketplace.
    

      “A major goal since I joined the company in April has been to put the 
      recent past of the company behind us, and re-focus the company under an 
      entirely new brand, “TrovaGeneTM” which will emphasize a 
      commercially focused business based on the company’s unique trans-renal 
      molecular diagnostic technology,” said Dr. Thomas H. Adams, Chairman of 
      the Board and former Chairman, CEO, and founder of Gen-Probe Inc. "Over 
      the past five years the company has established a very strong 
      intellectual property position in the field of molecular diagnostics 
      based upon the detection of trans-renal DNA and RNA. This patent 
      position is as important in the field of molecular diagnostics as the 
      patent position of the PCR patents of Roche and the ribosomal RNA and 
      amplification patents of Gen-Probe. The key to our strategy going 
      forward has been to identify the type of leader with the proven skills 
      and know-how to develop TrovaGene into a successful molecular diagnostic 
      business. I am pleased today to say that the search has culminated with 
      the appointment of Bruce Huebner. Bruce has a proven track record and 
      unique qualities that make him ideal for this task, and I am pleased to 
      welcome him on board.”
    

      “I am pleased to join the company at this critical time, and look 
      forward to working closely with Tom, as we strategically refocus the 
      company’s development, partnering, and commercial efforts under the 
      TrovaGeneTM banner, as well as building the company into a 
      key player in the molecular diagnostic marketplace,” said Mr. Huebner. 
      “I am particularly impressed with the extensive IP portfolio related to 
      the detection of trans-renal DNA and RNA in urine specimens. Our plan is 
      to pursue a combined collaboration and development strategy which 
      includes identifying corporate partners in Japan and Europe, while 
      TrovaGene focuses on development of products for the North American 
      market.”
    

      About Xenomics, Inc. and TrovaGene, Inc.
    

      The company has focused on the development of DNA and RNA-based tests 
      using Trans-renal DNA (Tr-DNA) or RNA (Tr-RNA). Its patented technology 
      uses safe and simple urine collection and can be applied to a broad 
      range of applications, including tumor detection and monitoring, 
      infectious disease detection, prenatal testing, tissue transplantation, 
      genetic testing for forensic identity determination, drug development, 
      and research to counter bioterrorism. Its TrovaGene, Inc. subsidiary was 
      formed principally to provide a mechanism to change the company’s 
      corporate domicile from Florida to Delaware and the company’s corporate 
      name by statutory merger. The company’s founding scientists were the 
      first to report that fragments of DNA from normal cell death cross the 
      kidney barrier and can be detected in urine. The company believes that 
      its technology will open significant new markets in the molecular 
      diagnostics field. The company has been issued three U.S. patents 
      covering different applications of the technology for molecular 
      diagnostics and genetic testing and a European patent for the company's 
      prenatal testing applications, as well as numerous pending patent 
      applications.

Vermillion Appoints Bruce A. Huebner to Chairman of the Board


News   Jun 28, 2013
                
 








 


Vermillion, Inc. has appointed Bruce A. Huebner as chairman effective March 18, 2013. He succeeds James S. Burns, who will continue to serve on the board of directors.
Huebner's appointment represents an important step in the execution of the company's leadership succession plan that began in 2012.
Huebner previously served as Vermillion's CEO on an interim basis until the recent appointment of Thomas McLain to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer, which also took effect yesterday. Huebner has been a company director since May 2011.
"Bruce demonstrated highly effective leadership during this transition period," said Burns. "Given his performance, as well as his more than 37 years of diagnostic industry experience and history of valuable contributions as a director, the board believes that the company and its shareholders would greatly benefit from Bruce as our chairman. I look forward to working closely with Bruce and our new president to build shareholder value, as we advance Vermillion as a leading diagnostics company addressing unmet clinical needs in women's health."
Shareholder VoteAt the company's 2012 annual meeting on March 21, the board has request shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares in the company's 2010 stock incentive plan by 1.3 million shares.
"The company currently has only nominal shares available under the 2010 stock incentive plan," noted Chairman Huebner. "We will need more shares to attract qualified executives, directors and employees to Vermillion. Without the approval of these additional shares, we will have to increase the cash compensation to these individuals. We would also not have the benefit of incentivized performance that is typically created by a stock option plan, and one that better aligns the interests of management and employees with that of our shareholders. So, it is in the best interest of Vermillion shareholders that we approve the expansion of this plan."
Huebner Career BiographyBruce Huebner brings to the role of Vermillion's chairman extensive executive management experience in multiple clinical diagnostic companies, including Osmetech Molecular Diagnostics, Nanogen and Gen-Probe.
While serving as president of Osmetech, he successfully established the company as a fully integrated business, obtaining FDA clearance for four molecular diagnostic microarray products and introducing them to the marketplace. Huebner was previously president and chief operating officer of Nanogen, a publicly held nanotechnology and microarray company.
Prior to Nanogen, he was executive vice president and chief operating officer of Gen-Probe, a global leader in the development of nucleic acid tests, including diagnostic tests for infectious disease that affect women's health.
In less than 10 years, he grew Gen-Probe's annual revenues from $42 million to a run-rate of more than $150 million.
Huebner is currently a managing director of LynxCom Partners, a healthcare consulting firm with a focus on cancer diagnostics and personalized medicine.

Bruce Huebner - Shakuhachi Flutist

Shakuhachi Flutist


About Bruce
Book Bruce












Tagline



								"The Japanese Shakuhachi derives from an ancient instrument that had seven or eight finger holes.  One innovation in Japan was to remove two of the holes leaving only five.  It is easy to bore a hole in a flute, but to remove one is genius.  This is another example of how the Japanese reduce an art to its essence.  The shakuhachi is stoic, but also very expressive.  My intention is to honor the tradition of this ancient and beautiful instrument while urging it into the present - to play it as an instrument of the world that is relevant no matter the time or place.”  

								-- Bruce Huebner   		
							







About Bruce








Before they hear him perform, Japanese people often ask why Bruce Huebner chose the shakuhachi, sometimes called the bamboo flute. “People here respond to me with great curiosity,” he remarks, “but if they have a chance to attend a concert, they recognize that they have missed something of great value that was always available to them, and they express gratitude to me for bringing the shakuhachi to their attention.” Terri Nii, Via Magazine 2014
