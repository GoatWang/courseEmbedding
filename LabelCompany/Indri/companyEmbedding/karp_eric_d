Rahway Regional Cancer Center�s Medical Director 



Dr. Eric Karp, who was born and raised in New York, is the founder and director of Rahway Regional Cancer Center (founded in 1993).  During his residency, Dr. Karp envisioned a freestanding radiation oncology facility that would provide superior cancer care in the community setting.  Sixteen years later, in pursuit of his mission to cure cancer, he has treated thousands and thousands of cancer patients with the most sophisticated radiation therapy available.  Dr. Karp ensures that every aspect of his patient's experience is optimized and he is personally available 24 hours a day. 

Dr. Karp is a board-certified radiation oncologist. Early in his training, he positioned himself as a leader in this field by graduating with honors from Columbia University and receiving his medical degree from the esteemed Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He then received his residency training entirely at the world�s leading radiation oncology training program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NYC. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering in NYC, Dr. Karp excelled to such a level that he was awarded an American Cancer Society Fellowship in clinical oncology.  He brings this level of excellence to Rahway Regional Cancer Center to make it one of the premier radiation facilities in the country.

Along with his extraordinary educational achievements, Dr. Karp has vast experience treating thousands of patients with all types of cancers. He leads a team of  qualified physicists, radiation therapists and nurses to administer the most sophisticated techniques of  cancer treatments.  His state of the art facility uses the latest equipment to safely and effectively treat and destroy all types of cancers while protecting his patients against radiation side effects.  Elekta�s Precise Treatment System, Nucletron�s High Dose Rate Remote After-loader and Philips Medical System�s Syntegra, the most sophisticated treatment planning software available, are just some of the powerful tools assisting Dr. Karp in the battle against cancer.  Impressively, Dr. Karp also established central New Jersey�s first prostate seed implant program and is considered to be one of the top brachytherapy experts in the world.   


Dr. Karp developed a staff at Rahway Regional Cancer Center that recognizes that delivering the best technical treatment is only part of the healing process. This center provides its patients with tangible assistance such as individualized care, door to door transportation at no charge, monthly patient support groups  and expert counseling on nutrition.  The American College of Radiology, the leading national organization for surveying radiation programs, awarded Rahway Regional Cancer Center a full three year accreditation further attesting to its quality of care.

Opportunities and challenges in biological lignin valorization



Beckham, Gregg T.
						; Johnson, Christopher W.
						; Karp, Eric M.
						; ... December 2016 - Current Opinion in Biotechnology


Lignin is a primary component of lignocellulosic biomass that is an underutilized feedstock in the growing biofuels industry. Despite the fact that lignin depolymerization has long been studied, the intrinsic heterogeneity of lignin typically leads to heterogeneous streams of aromatic compounds, which in turn present significant technical challenges when attempting to produce lignin-derived chemicals where purity is often a concern. In Nature, microorganisms often encounter this same problem during biomass turnover wherein powerful oxidative enzymes produce heterogeneous slates of aromatics compounds. Some microbes have evolved metabolic pathways to convert these aromatic species via ‘upper pathways’ into central intermediates, which canmore » then be funneled through ‘lower pathways’ into central carbon metabolism in a process we dubbed ‘biological funneling’. This funneling approach offers a direct, biological solution to overcome heterogeneity problems in lignin valorization for the modern biorefinery. Coupled to targeted separations and downstream chemical catalysis, this concept offers the ability to produce a wide range of molecules from lignin. This perspective describes research opportunities and challenges ahead for this new field of research, which holds significant promise towards a biorefinery concept wherein polysaccharides and lignin are treated as equally valuable feedstocks. In particular, we discuss tailoring the lignin substrate for microbial utilization, host selection for biological funneling, ligninolytic enzyme–microbe synergy, metabolic engineering, expanding substrate specificity for biological funneling, and process integration, each of which presents key challenges. Ultimately, for biological solutions to lignin valorization to be viable, multiple questions in each of these areas will need to be addressed, making biological lignin valorization a multidisciplinary, co-design problem.« less

Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Corn Stover Lignin



Anderson, Eric M.
						; Katahira, Rui
						; Reed, Michelle
						; ... December 2016 - ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering


Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) has emerged as an effective biomass pretreatment strategy to depolymerize lignin into tractable fragments in high yields. We investigate the RCF of corn stover, a highly abundant herbaceous feedstock, using carbon-supported Ru and Ni catalysts at 200 and 250 degrees C in methanol and, in the presence or absence of an acid cocatalyst (H3PO4 or an acidified carbon support). Three key performance variables were studied: (1) the effectiveness of lignin extraction as measured by the yield of lignin oil, (2) the yield of monomers in the lignin oil, and (3) the carbohydrate retention in the residualmore » solids after RCF. The monomers included methyl coumarate/ferulate, propyl guaiacol/syringol, and ethyl guaiacol/syringol. The Ru and Ni catalysts performed similarly in terms of product distribution and monomer yields. The monomer yields increased monotonically as a function of time for both temperatures. At 6 h, monomer yields of 27.2 and 28.3% were obtained at 250 and 200 degrees C, respectively, with Ni/C. The addition of an acid cocatalysts to the Ni/C system increased monomer yields to 32% for acidified carbon and 38% for phosphoric acid at 200 degrees C. The monomer product distribution was dominated by methyl coumarate regardless of the use of the acid cocatalysts. The use of phosphoric acid at 200 degrees C or the high temperature condition without acid resulted in complete lignin extraction and partial sugar solubilization (up to 50%) thereby generating lignin oil yields that exceeded the theoretical limit. In contrast, using either Ni/C or Ni on acidified carbon at 200 degrees C resulted in moderate lignin oil yields of ca. 55%, with sugar retention values >90%. Notably, these sugars were amenable to enzymatic digestion, reaching conversions >90% at 96 h. Characterization studies on the lignin oils using two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatrography revealed that soluble oligomers are formed via solvolysis, followed by further fragmentation on the catalyst surface via hydrogenolysis. Overall, the results show that clear trade-offs exist between the levels of lignin extraction, monomer yields, and carbohydrate retention in the residual solids for different RCF conditions of corn stover.« less

Techno-Economic Basis for Coproduct Manufacturing To Enable Hydrocarbon Fuel Production from Lignocellulosic Biomass



Biddy, Mary J.
						; Davis, Ryan
						; Humbird, David
						; ... June 2016 - ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering


Biorefinery process development relies on techno-economic analysis (TEA) to identify primary cost drivers, prioritize research directions, and mitigate technical risk for scale-up through development of detailed process designs. Here, we conduct TEA of a model 2000 dry metric ton-per-day lignocellulosic biorefinery that employs a two-step pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis to produce biomass-derived sugars, followed by biological lipid production, lipid recovery, and catalytic hydrotreating to produce renewable diesel blendstock (RDB). On the basis of projected near-term technical feasibility of these steps, we predict that RDB could be produced at a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of USD $9.55/gasoline-gallon-equivalent (GGE), predicated onmore » the need for improvements in the lipid productivity and yield beyond current benchmark performance. This cost is significant given the limitations in scale and high costs for aerobic cultivation of oleaginous microbes and subsequent lipid extraction/recovery. In light of this predicted cost, we developed an alternative pathway which demonstrates that RDB costs could be substantially reduced in the near term if upgradeable fractions of biomass, in this case hemicellulose-derived sugars, are diverted to coproducts of sufficient value and market size; here, we use succinic acid as an example coproduct. The coproduction model predicts an MFSP of USD $5.28/GGE when leaving conversion and yield parameters unchanged for the fuel production pathway, leading to a change in biorefinery RDB capacity from 24 to 15 MM GGE/year and 0.13 MM tons of succinic acid per year. Additional analysis demonstrates that beyond the near-term projections assumed in the models here, further reductions in the MFSP toward $2-3/GGE (which would be competitive with fossil-based hydrocarbon fuels) are possible with additional transformational improvements in the fuel and coproduct trains, especially in terms of carbon efficiency to both fuels and coproducts, recovery and purification of fuels and coproducts, and coproduct selection and price. Overall, this analysis documents potential economics for both a hydrocarbon fuel and bioproduct process pathway and highlights prioritized research directions beyond the current benchmark to enable hydrocarbon fuel production via an oleaginous microbial platform with simultaneous coproduct manufacturing from lignocellulosic biomass.« less

Gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis enables rapid analysis of acids in complex biomass-derived streams



Munson, Matthew S.
						; Karp, Eric M.
						; Nimlos, Claire T.
						; ... September 2016 - ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering


Biomass conversion processes such as pretreatment, liquefaction, and pyrolysis often produce complex mixtures of intermediates that are a substantial challenge to analyze rapidly and reliably. To characterize these streams more comprehensively and efficiently, new techniques are needed to track species through biomass deconstruction and conversion processes. Here, we present the application of an emerging analytical method, gradient elution moving boundary electrophoresis (GEMBE), to quantify a suite of acids in a complex, biomass-derived streams from alkaline pretreatment of corn stover. GEMBE offers distinct advantages over common chromatography-spectrometry analytical approaches in terms of analysis time, sample preparation requirements, and cost of equipment.more » As demonstrated here, GEMBE is able to track 17 distinct compounds (oxalate, formate, succinate, malate, acetate, glycolate, protocatechuate, 3-hydroxypropanoate, lactate, glycerate, 2-hydroxybutanoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, p-coumarate, ferulate, sinapate, and acetovanillone). The lower limit of detection was compound dependent and ranged between 0.9 and 3.5 umol/L. Results from GEMBE were similar to recent results from an orthogonal method based on GCxGC-TOF/MS. Altogether, GEMBE offers a rapid, robust approach to analyze complex biomass-derived samples, and given the ease and convenience of deployment, may offer an analytical solution for online tracking of multiple types of biomass streams.« less
