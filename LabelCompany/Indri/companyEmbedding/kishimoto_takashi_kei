About Selecta


Selecta 
      Biosciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing an 
      entirely new class of targeted vaccines that induces an antigen-specific 
      immune activation or antigen-specific immune tolerance for therapeutic 
      and prophylactic applications. Selecta's proprietary Synthetic Vaccine 
      Particle (SVP™) platform creates a new paradigm in vaccine development, 
      enabling completely new therapeutic applications while offering the 
      potential of improved efficacy and safety profiles. Selecta’s fully 
      synthetic engineering of novel vaccines offers a number of compelling 
      benefits, including flexible modular vaccine design and accelerated 
      development timelines using robust manufacturing processes. Selecta’s 
      SVP™ platform 
      technology is flexible to enable diverse vaccines and the company 
      has created targeted antigen-specific Synthetic Vaccine Particles (tSVP™) 
      and targeted antigen-specific tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (t2SVP™).
    

Targeted 
      Synthetic Vaccine Particles (tSVP™) activate immune responses 
      to a wide array of relevant antigens, including small molecules, 
      peptides, oligosaccharides, and proteins. These particles can target 
      humoral or cellular pathways of the immune system. Examples for 
      applications include cancer, infectious diseases and addiction. Targeted 
      tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (t2SVP™) 
      are designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance. Examples for 
      applications include autoimmune diseases, allergies and transplant 
      rejection.
    

      Selecta’s pipeline 
      currently contains a vaccine for smoking cessation and relapse 
      prevention, a vaccine for Type 1 Diabetes, vaccines for several 
      infectious diseases (universal influenza, universal human 
      papillomavirus, and malaria), and research approaches with cancer 
      vaccines and in the field of allergies.
    

      Building on the company’s novel approach, Selecta’s product candidates 
      have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class 
      therapeutics to treat and prevent diseases. Selecta Biosciences is based 
      in Watertown, Massachusetts, USA. For more information, please visit www.selectabio.com.

Title: Rational design of Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP) for therapeutic treatment of chronic diseases 



Biography

Dr. Kishimoto is the Chief Scientific Officer of Selecta Biosciences, a biotechnology company developing synthetic vaccines based on a novel self-assembling nanoparticle technology. Prior to joining Selecta, he was Vice President of Research at Momenta Pharmaceuticals where he led a multidisciplinary team in advancing both novel and complex generic products. Previously he held leadership positions at Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Boehringer Ingelheim. Dr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles, including articles in Nature, Science, Cell, and the New England Journal of Medicine.

Abstract

Vaccines for the prophylaxis of infectious diseases have been one of the most effective interventions for improving human health. Recent advances in immunology and vaccine technology have opened the door to novel vaccine-based therapies for the therapeutic treatment of chronic diseases. We have developed a flexible and modular Synthetic Vaccine Particle (SVP) technology that enables the rational design of both stimulatory vaccines and tolerogenic immune therapies. Our targeted SVPs (tSVP) have been designed and optimized to promote efficient cross-presentation of antigen and stimulate robust cellular immunity for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections, while our tolerogenic targeted SVPs (t2SVP) are designed to induce immune tolerance for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and immunogenicity of biological therapies. We will describe the general design principles of these synthetic, self-assembling nanoparticles and provide examples for use in various disease settings.

Takashi Kei Kishimoto
 Selecta Biociences, USA

Title: Rational design of Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP) for therapeutic treatment of chronic diseases 



Biography

Dr. Kishimoto is the Chief Scientific Officer of Selecta Biosciences, a biotechnology company developing synthetic vaccines based on a novel self-assembling nanoparticle technology. Prior to joining Selecta, he was Vice President of Research at Momenta Pharmaceuticals where he led a multidisciplinary team in advancing both novel and complex generic products. Previously he held leadership positions at Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Boehringer Ingelheim. Dr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles, including articles in Nature, Science, Cell, and the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Kishimoto received his doctoral degree in Immunology from Harvard University and his post-doctoral training at Stanford University.
Abstract

Vaccines for the prophylaxis of infectious diseases have been one of the most effective interventions for improving human health. Recent advances in immunology and vaccine technology have opened the door to novel vaccine-based therapies for the therapeutic treatment of chronic diseases. We have developed a flexible and modular Synthetic Vaccine Particle (SVP) technology that enables the rational design of both stimulatory vaccines and tolerogenic immune therapies. Our targeted SVPs (tSVP) have been designed and optimized to promote efficient cross-presentation of antigen and stimulate robust cellular immunity for the treatment of cancer and chronic infections, while our tolerogenic targeted SVPs (t2SVP) are designed to induce immune tolerance for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and immunogenicity of biological therapies. We will describe the general design principles of these synthetic, self-assembling nanoparticles and provide examples for use in various disease settings.

Selecta’s unique Synthetic Vaccine Particle (SVP™) platform has the potential to radically change how serious diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and chronic infectious diseases are treated,” said Dr. Kishimoto. “Selecta’s broad technology platform has the power to both stimulate potent and protective immune responses as well as dampen deleterious immune responses in an antigen-specific manner.”
Prior to joining Selecta, Dr. Kishimoto was Vice President of Research at Momenta Pharmaceuticals where he led a multidisciplinary team in advancing both novel and complex generic products for inflammation, oncology, and cardiovascular disease. Previously, he was Senior Director of Inflammation Research at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, where he provided the scientific leadership for four programs in clinical development, and was an Associate Director of Research at Boehringer Ingelheim. Dr. Kishimoto has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals, including Nature, Science, Cell, and the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Kishimoto received his doctoral degree in Immunology from Harvard University and his post-doctoral training at Stanford University.
About Selecta
Selecta Biosciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing an entirely new class of targeted vaccines that induces an antigen-specific immune activation or antigen-specific immune tolerance for therapeutic and prophylactic applications. Selecta’s proprietary Synthetic Vaccine Particle (SVP™) platform creates a new paradigm in vaccine development, enabling completely new therapeutic applications while offering the potential of improved efficacy and safety profiles. Selecta’s fully synthetic engineering of novel vaccines offers a number of compelling benefits, including flexible modular vaccine design and accelerated development timelines using robust manufacturing processes. Selecta’s SVP™ platform technology is flexible to enable diverse vaccines and the company has created targeted antigen-specific Synthetic Vaccine Particles (tSVP™) and targeted antigen-specific tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (t2SVP™).
Targeted Synthetic Vaccine Particles (tSVP™) activate immune responses to a wide array of relevant antigens, including small molecules, peptides, oligosaccharides, and proteins. These particles can target humoral or cellular pathways of the immune system. Examples for applications include cancer, infectious diseases and addiction. Targeted tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (t2SVP™) are designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance. Examples for applications include autoimmune diseases, allergies and transplant rejection.
Selecta’s pipeline currently contains a vaccine for smoking cessation and relapse prevention, a vaccine for Type 1 Diabetes, vaccines for several infectious diseases (universal influenza, universal human papillomavirus, and malaria), and research approaches with cancer vaccines and in the field of allergies.
Building on the company’s novel approach, Selecta’s product candidates have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapeutics to treat and prevent diseases. Selecta Biosciences is based in Watertown, Massachusetts, USA. For more information, please visit www.selectabio.com.
