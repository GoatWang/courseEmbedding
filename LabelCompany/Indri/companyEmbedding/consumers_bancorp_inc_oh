(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  General  The following is management's analysis of the Corporation's results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2017, compared to June 30, 2016. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Consumers Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio (the Corporation), owns all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Consumers National Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America (the Bank). The Corporation's activities have been limited primarily to holding the common shares of the Bank. The Bank's business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Stark, Summit, Wayne and contiguous counties in Ohio. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal obligations, mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.  Results of Operations  Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016  In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, net income was $566, or $0.21 per common share, compared to $708, or $0.26 per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The following are key highlights of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017:  ? net interest income increased by $81 to $3,530, or by 2.3%, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period;  ? loan loss provision expense in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 totaled $255 compared to $130 in the same prior year period;  ? non-interest income increased by $32, or 4.3%, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period; and  ? non-interest expenses increased by $224, or 7.0%, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  In the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, net income was $2,189, or $0.80 per common share, compared to $2,074, or $0.76 per common share for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The following are key highlights of our results of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2017:  ? net interest income increased by $514 to $10,793, or by 5.0%, in fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period;  ? non-interest income increased by $220, or 10.0%, in fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period; and  ? non-interest expenses increased by $493, or 5.2%, in fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period principally as a result of higher occupancy and equipment expenses.  Return on average equity and return on average assets were 6.72% and 0.67%, respectively, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.47% and 0.66%, respectively, for the same prior year period.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Corporation's earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total average interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances.  The Corporation's net interest margin was 3.64% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with 3.73% for the same period in 2016. FTE net interest income, interest rate spread for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $81, or 2.2%, to $3,716 from $3,635 for the same year ago period. The increase in FTE net interest income was primarily the result of an increase of $21,163, or 5.4%, in average interest-earning assets from the same prior year period.  FTE interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $140, or 3.6%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation's yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.91% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease from 3.96% for the same period last year. Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $59, or 26.5%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation's cost of funds was 0.39% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with 0.32% for the same year ago period.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  The Corporation's net interest margin was 3.71% for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared with 3.70% for the same period in 2016. FTE net interest income, interest rate spread for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $514, or 4.7%, to $11,345 from $10,831 for the same year ago period. Interest income was positively impacted by $191 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 as the result of the payoff of two loan relationships that were on non-accrual. Excluding the interest income recognized on the non-accrual loans, the net interest margin would have been 3.65% for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  Provision for Loan Losses  The provision for loan losses represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management's assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the Bank's loan portfolio that have been incurred at each balance sheet date. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $255 compared to $130 for the same prior year period. For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $531 compared to $414 for the same prior year period.  Total non-performing loans were $3,390 as of March 31, 2017 compared with $1,589 as of December 31, 2016 and $6,034 as of June 30, 2016. The increase in non-performing loans from December 31, 2016 was the result of placing one commercial real estate credit with a recorded investment of $1,762 on non-accrual. In addition, the provision for loan losses was $195 for the commercial real estate portfolio for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a specific reserve that was recorded related to the commercial real estate credit that was placed on non-accrual.  For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017, net charge-offs totaled $726, or an annualized net charge-off to total loan ratio of 0.35%, compared with $183, or 0.10% of total loans, for the same period last year. Net charge-offs for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017 were impacted by a $700 charge-off related to one commercial real estate credit. The collateral securing this credit is in the process of being liquidated and is expected to result in the Bank receiving payment in the amount of the remaining balance of the recorded investment. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.24% at March 31, 2017 and 1.39% at June 30, 2016.  The provision for loan losses for the period ended March 31, 2017 was considered sufficient by management for maintaining an appropriate allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Non-Interest Income  Non-interest income increased by $32 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year. Non-interest income increased by $220, or 10.0%, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, debit card interchange income increased by $128 from the same prior year period; however, debit card processing expenses increased by $110 over the same period. Non-interest income was also positively impacted by increases in gains from the sale of mortgage loans and earnings on bank owned life insurance.  Non-Interest Expenses  Total non-interest expenses increased to $3,415, or by 7.0%, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared with $3,191 during the same year ago period. Total non-interest expenses increased to $10,027, or by 5.2%, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared with $9,534 during the same year ago period. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $256, or 22.3%, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year primarily as a result of an increase in building- related expenses since the new branch and corporate office facility in Minerva, Ohio was completed during the third fiscal quarter of 2016. In addition, professional and director fees increased by $73, or 20.2%, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in legal fees. Legal and consulting fees for fiscal year 2017 are expected to continue to trend above the prior fiscal year.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  Income Taxes  Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $94, to $62 from $156, compared to a year ago. The effective tax rate was 9.9% for the current quarter as compared to 18.1% for the same period last year.  Income tax expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $9, to $459 from $450, compared to a year ago. The effective tax rate was 17.3% for the current period as compared to 17.8% for the same period last year.  The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate principally as a result of tax-exempt income from obligations of states and political subdivisions, loans and earnings on bank owned life insurance.  Financial Condition  Total assets at March 31, 2017 were $448,177 compared to $430,390 at June 30, 2016, an increase of $17,787, or an annualized 5.5%.  Total loans increased by $16,047, or an annualized 8.3%, from $256,278 at June 30, 2016 to $272,325 at March 31, 2017. The growth in loans was primarily attributed to the investments in two newer loan production offices in the Stow and Wooster, Ohio markets as well as additions in commercial loan staff. The loan growth was primarily funded by an increase of $20,201, or an annualized 7.8%, in total deposits. The cash surrender value of life insurance increased to $8,997 at March 31, 2017 from $6,819 at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the investment of $2 million in additional BOLI policies.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  Non-Performing Assets The following table presents the aggregate amounts of non-performing assets and respective ratios as of the dates indicated. March 31, June 30, March 31, 2017 2016 2016 Non-accrual loans $ 3,385 $ 6,034 $ 3,343 Loans past due over 90 days and still accruing 5 - 6 Total non-performing loans 3,390 6,034 3,349 Other real estate owned - - 38 Total non-performing assets $ 3,390 $ 6,034 $ 3,387 Non-performing loans to total loans 1.24 % 2.35 % 1.38 % Allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans 99.44 % 59.10 % 79.52 %  Non-accrual loans decreased from June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of receiving full payoff of two loan relationships with a recorded investment of $3.1 million. As of March 31, 2017, impaired loans totaled $3,704, of which $3,348 are included in non-accrual loans. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are classified as impaired if management determines that full collection of principal and interest, in accordance with the terms of the loan documents, is not probable. Impaired loans and non-performing loans have been considered in management's analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Management and the Board of Directors are closely monitoring these loans and believe that the prospects for recovery of principal and interest, less identified specific reserves, are favorable.  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Liquidity  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure adequate cash flows to accommodate the demands of our customers and provide adequate flexibility for the Corporation to take advantage of market opportunities under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. Cash is used to fund loans, purchase investments, fund the maturity of liabilities, and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities. The Corporation's principal sources of funds are deposits; amortization and prepayments of loans; maturities, sales and principal receipts from securities; borrowings; and operations. Management considers the asset position of the Corporation to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Corporation's earning assets are mainly comprised of loans and investment securities. Management continually strives to obtain the best mix of loans and investments to both maximize yield and insure the soundness of the portfolio, as well as to provide funding for loan demand as needed.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  Net cash inflow from operating activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 was $4,095, net cash outflows from investing activities was $20,092 and net cash inflows from financing activities was $18,046. A major source of cash was $19,017 from sales, maturities, calls or principal pay downs on available-for-sale securities and a $20,201 increase in deposits. A major use of cash included the $21,757 purchase of securities and $17,019 increase in loans. Total cash and cash equivalents was $12,230 as of March 31, 2017 compared to $10,181 at June 30, 2016 and $14,138 at March 31, 2016.  The Bank offers several types of deposit products to its customers. We believe the rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with others currently available in the market area. Deposits totaled $366,849 at March 31, 2017 compared with $346,648 at June 30, 2016.  To provide an additional source of liquidity, the Corporation has entered into an agreement with the FHLB of Cincinnati. At March 31, 2017, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled $13,335 compared with $17,281 at June 30, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $21,778 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The Corporation considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base.  Short-term borrowings consisted of repurchase agreements, which is a financing arrangement that matures daily, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks. The Bank pledges securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Short-term borrowings increased to $21,901 at March 31, 2017 from $19,129 at June 30, 2016.  Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of $100 and over) totaled $28,119 at March 31, 2017 and $26,879 at June 30, 2016. These deposits are monitored closely by the Corporation and are mainly priced on an individual basis. When these deposits are from a municipality, certain bank-owned securities are pledged to guarantee the safety of these public fund deposits as required by Ohio law. The Corporation has the option to use a fee-paid broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding. The Corporation, however, does not rely upon these deposits as a primary source of funding. Although management monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis, a quarterly rate sensitivity report is used to determine the effect of interest rate changes on the financial statements. In the opinion of management, enough assets or liabilities could be repriced over the near term (up to three years) to compensate for such changes. The spread on interest rates, or the difference between the average earning assets and the average interest-bearing liabilities, is monitored quarterly.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  In the normal course of business, to meet the financial needs of our customers, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause, some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for on-balance sheet instruments and collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary. Undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects. Unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed, but committed for home equity, commercial and consumer lines of credit. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Total unused . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  General  The following is management's analysis of the Corporation's results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016, compared to June 30, 2016. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Consumers Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio (the Corporation), owns all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Consumers National Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America (the Bank). The Corporation's activities have been limited primarily to holding the common shares of the Bank. The Bank's business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Stark, Summit, Wayne and contiguous counties in Ohio. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal obligations, mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, net income was $901, or $0.33 per common share, compared to $727, or $0.27 per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The following are key highlights of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016:  ? net interest income increased by $334 to $3,727, or by 9.8%, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period;  ? loan loss provision expense in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 totaled $136 compared to $92 in the same prior year period;  ? non-interest income increased by $113, or 15.4%, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period; and  ? non-interest expenses increased by $149, or 4.7%, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same prior year period principally as a result of higher occupancy and equipment expenses.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operation (continued)  (Dollars in thousand, except per share data)  Return on average equity and return on average assets were 8.12% and 0.83%, respectively, for the first three months of fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.90% and 0.70%, respectively, for the same prior year period.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Corporation's earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total average interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances.  The Corporation's net interest margin was 3.87% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 3.69% for the same period in 2015. FTE net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $334, or 9.3%, to $3,908 from $3,574 for the same year ago period.  FTE interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $347, or 9.1%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation's yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase from 3.93% for the same period last year. Interest income was positively impacted by $191 as the result of the payoff of two loan relationships that were on non-accrual. Excluding the interest income recognized on the non-accrual loans, the yield on average interest-earning assets would have been 3.92% for the current quarter ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $13, or 5.7%, from the same year ago period. The Corporation's cost of funds was 0.34% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 0.33% for the same year ago period.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operation (continued)  (Dollars in thousand, except per share data)  Average Balance Sheets and Analysis of Net Interest Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except percentages) 2016 2015 Average Yield/ Average Yield/ Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Interest-earning assets: Taxable securities $ 75,967 $ 402 2.14 % $ 86,757 $ 457 2.12 % Nontaxable securities (1) 59,093 526 3.65 54,589 517 3.79 Loans receivable (1) 260,683 3,190 4.85 232,229 2,803 4.79 Interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold 8,651 30 1.38 11,784 24 0.81 Total interest-earning assets 404,394 4,148 4.10 % 385,359 3,801 3.93 % Noninterest-earning assets 26,760 25,915 Total Assets $ 431,154 $ 411,274 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW $ 48,580 $ 17 0.14 % $ 47,751 $ 17 0.14 % Savings 133,512 31 0.09 136,764 30 0.09 Time deposits 66,006 122 0.73 65,393 129 0.78 Short-term borrowings 19,448 12 0.24 19,531 8 0.16 FHLB advances 15,124 58 1.52 6,265 43 2.72 Total interest-bearing liabilities 282,670 240 0.34 % 275,704 227 0.33 % Noninterest-bearing liabilities: Noninterest-bearing checking accounts 101,144 90,250 Other liabilities 3,321 3,406 Total liabilities 387,135 369,360 Shareholders' equity 44,019 41,914 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 431,154 $ 411,274 Net interest income, interest rate spread (1) $ 3,908 3.76 % $ 3,574 3.60 % Net interest margin (net interest as a percent of average interest-earning assets) (1) 3.87 % 3.69 % Federal tax exemption on non-taxable securities and loans included in interest income $ 181 $ 181 Average interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities 143.06 % 139.77 %  (1) calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operation (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  Provision for Loan Losses  The provision for loan losses represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management's assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the Bank's loan portfolio that have been incurred at each balance sheet date. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $136 compared to $92 for the same prior year period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net charge-offs totaled $18, or an annualized net charge-offs to total loan ratio of 0.03%, compared with $10, or 0.02% of total loans, for the same period last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.41% at September 30, 2016 and 1.39% at June 30, 2016.  The provision for loan losses for the period ended September 30, 2016 was considered sufficient by management for maintaining an appropriate allowance for probable incurred credit losses.  Non-Interest Income  Non-interest income increased by $113 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, a $103 net gain was recognized from the sale of securities compared with a $35 net gain in the same prior year period.  Non-Interest Expenses  Total non-interest expenses increased to $3,286, or by 4.7%, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared with $3,137 during the same year ago period. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $110, or 32.2%, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 from the same period last year primarily as a result of an increase in building depreciation expense and real estate taxes since the new branch and corporate office facility in Minerva, Ohio was completed during the third fiscal quarter of 2016.  Income Taxes  Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $80, to $252 compared to a year ago. The effective tax rate was 21.9% for the current quarter as compared to 19.1% for the same period last year.  The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate principally as a result of tax-exempt income from obligations of states and political subdivisions, loans and earnings on bank owned life insurance.  Financial Condition  Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $433,424 compared to $430,390 at June 30, 2016, an increase of $3,034, or an annualized 2.8%.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  Total loans increased by $4,209, or an annualized 6.6%, from $256,278 at June 30, 2016 to $260,487 at September 30, 2016. The growth in loans was primarily attributed to the investments in two newer loan production offices in the Stow and Wooster, Ohio markets as well as additions in commercial loan staff. The loan growth was primarily funded by an increase of $6,323, or an annualized 7.3%, in total deposits.  Non-Performing Assets The following table presents the aggregate amounts of non-performing assets and respective ratios as of the dates indicated. September 30, June 30, September 30, 2016 2016 2015 Non-accrual loans $ 2,354 $ 6,034 $ 3,244 Loans past due over 90 days and still accruing - - - Total non-performing loans 2,354 6,034 3,244 Other real estate owned 10 - 38 Total non-performing assets $ 2,364 $ 6,034 $ 3,282 Non-performing loans to total loans 0.90 % 2.35 % 1.39 % Allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans 156.50 % 59.10 % 77.50 %  Non-accrual loans decreased from June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of receiving full payoff of two loan relationships with a recorded investment of $3.1 million. As of September 30, 2016, impaired loans totaled $3,122, of which $2,354 are included in non-accrual loans. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are classified as impaired if management determines that full collection of principal and interest, in accordance with the terms of the loan documents, is not probable. Impaired loans and non-performing loans have been considered in management's analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Management and the Board of Directors are closely monitoring these loans and believe that the prospects for recovery of principal and interest, less identified specific reserves, are favorable.  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Liquidity  The objective of liquidity management is to ensure adequate cash flows to accommodate the demands of our customers and provide adequate flexibility for the Corporation to take advantage of market opportunities under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. Cash is used to fund loans, purchase investments, fund the maturity of liabilities, and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities. The Corporation's principal sources of funds are deposits; amortization and prepayments of loans; maturities, sales and principal receipts from securities; borrowings; and operations. Management considers the asset position of the Corporation to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Corporation's earning assets are mainly comprised of loans and investment securities. Management continually strives to obtain the best mix of loans and investments to both maximize yield and insure the soundness of the portfolio, as well as to provide funding for loan demand as needed.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  Net cash inflow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $581, net cash outflows from investing activities was $727 and net cash inflows from financing activities was $2,498. A major source of cash was $7,585 from sales, maturities, calls or principal pay downs on available-for-sale securities, a $6,323 increase in deposits and a net increase of $1,417 in short-term borrowings. A major use of cash included the $4,229 purchase of securities and $4,237 increase in loans. Total cash and cash equivalents was $12,533 as of September 30, 2016 compared to $10,181 at June 30, 2016 and $13,648 at September 30, 2015.  The Bank offers several types of deposit products to its customers. The rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with others currently available in the market area. Deposits totaled $352,971 at September 30, 2016 compared with $346,648 at June 30, 2016.  To provide an additional source of liquidity, the Corporation has entered into an agreement with the FHLB of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2016, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled $12,366 as compared with $17,281 at June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $14,277 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The Corporation considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base.  Short-term borrowings consisted of repurchase agreements, which is a financing arrangement that matures daily, and federal funds purchased from correspondent banks. The Bank pledges securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Short-term borrowings increased to $20,546 at September 30, 2016 from $19,129 at June 30, 2016.  Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of $100 and over) totaled $27,174 at September 30, 2016 and $26,879 at June 30, 2016. These deposits are monitored closely by the Corporation and are mainly priced on an individual basis. When these deposits are from a municipality, certain bank-owned securities are pledged to guarantee the safety of these public fund deposits as required by Ohio law. The Corporation has the option to use a fee-paid broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding. The Corporation, however, does not rely upon these deposits as a primary source of funding. Although management monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis, a quarterly rate sensitivity report is used to determine the effect of interest rate changes on the financial statements. In the opinion of management, enough assets or liabilities could be repriced over the near term (up to three years) to compensate for such changes. The spread on interest rates, or the difference between the average earning assets and the average interest-bearing liabilities, is monitored quarterly.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  In the normal course of business, to meet the financial needs of our customers, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, and involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause, some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for on-balance sheet instruments and collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary. Undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects. Unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed, but committed for, home equity, commercial and consumer lines of credit. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Total unused commitments were $47,703 at September 30, 2016 and $47,728 at June 30, 2016.  Capital Resources  Total shareholders' equity increased to $44,020 as of September 30, 2016 from $43,793 as of June 30, 2016. The increase was the result of $901 in net income during the first quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, which was partially offset by $327 in cash dividends paid and a net reduction of $347 in accumulated other comprehensive income from a decline in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities.  The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal regulatory agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective-action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the Corporation's financial statements.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  The Bank's leverage, common equity tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of September 30, 2016 were 9.44%, 13.46% and 14.69%, respectively. This compares to leverage, common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios of 9.25%, 13.37% and 14.58%, respectively, as of June 30, 2016. The Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized for both periods. Management is not aware of any matters occurring subsequent to September 30, 2016 that would cause the Bank's capital category to change.  Critical Accounting Policies  The financial condition and results of operations for the Corporation presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Corporation's accounting policies. The selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change.  The Corporation has identified the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy and an understanding of this policy is necessary to understand the financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Note one (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses), note three (Loans) and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates) of the 2016 Form 10-K provide detail with regard to the Corporation's accounting for the allowance for loan losses. There have been no significant changes in the application of accounting policies since June 30, 2016.  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this report (including information incorporated by reference in this report), the words or phrases "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project," "believe" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond the Corporation's control, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. Any such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report or the respective dates of the relevant incorporated documents, as the case may be, and, except as required by law, the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Factors that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected include, but are not limited to:  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations (continued)  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  ? material unforeseen changes in the financial condition or results of Consumers National Bank's customers;  ? the economic impact from the oil and gas activity in the region could be less than expected or the timeline for development could be longer than anticipated;  ? regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality of assets and the underlying value of collateral could prove to be less valuable than otherwise assumed or debtors being unable to meet their obligations;  ? an extended period in which market levels of interest rates remain at historical low levels which could reduce, or put pressure on our ability to maintain, anticipated or actual margins;  ? competitive pressures on product pricing and services;  ? pricing and liquidity pressures that may result in a rising market rate environment; and  ? the nature, extent, and timing of government and regulatory actions.  The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks the Corporation faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Corporation or that the Corporation currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Corporation. Should any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, those developments could have material adverse effects on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations.  CONSUMERS BANCORP, INC.

	Consumers Bancorp, Inc. Reports:




	 





	 




	●






	Net income increased by $115 thousand, or 5.5%, to $2.2 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017 compared with same period last year








	 




	●






	Total loans increased by $16.0 million, or an annualized 8.3%, for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017







	 




	Minerva, Ohio— April 27, 2017 (OTCBB: CBKM) Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (Consumers) today reported net income of $566 thousand for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $708 thousand for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 were $0.21 compared to $0.26 for the same period last year.




	 




	For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, net income was $2.2 million compared to $2.1 million for the same period last year. Net income during the first three quarters of the 2017 fiscal year was positively impacted by a $514 thousand, or 5.0%, increase in net interest income which was primarily the result of a $19.0 million increase in average interest-earning assets from the prior year period. Fiscal year-to-date net income per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 for the same period last year.




	 




	Assets at March 31, 2017 totaled $448.2 million, an increase of $17.8 million, or an annualized 5.5%, from June 30, 2016. Loans increased by $16.0 million, or an annualized 8.3%, and deposits increased by $20.2 million, or an annualized 7.8% for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017.




	 




	“New commercial and residential loan production activity continues to increase as we move through the year. With fiscal year-to-date annualized loan and deposit growth of 8.3% and 7.8%, respectively, the bank’s asset mix continues to improve and the loan to deposit ratio is holding steady around 75%. While long-term market rates are fluctuating, the market trend has resulted in generally higher rates for new and repricing commercial loans,” stated Ralph J. Lober, President and Chief Executive Officer. He added that, “the bank has experienced retail and commercial deposit account activity from the announced expansion into Jefferson County. We expect new deposit account funding in this market to support future asset growth.”




	 




	Net interest income for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 increased by $81 thousand compared to the same period last year, with interest income increasing by $140 thousand and interest expense increasing by $59 thousand. The net interest margin was 3.64% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, 3.62% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and 3.73% for the same period last year. The Corporation’s yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.91% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decline from 3.96% for the same period last year. The Corporation’s cost of funds increased to 0.39% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 0.32% for the same period last year.




	 




	Other income increased by $32 thousand for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 primarily as a result of increases in debit card interchange income, gains from the sale of mortgage loans and earnings on bank owned life insurance.




	 




	Other expenses increased by $224 thousand, or 7.0%, for the third fiscal quarter of 2017 from the same period last year primarily as a result of increases in professional fees and debit card processing expenses.




	 




	 


	 




	 




	 




	Non-performing loans were $3.4 million at March 31, 2017, compared with $6.0 million at June 30, 2016 and $3.4 million at March 31, 2016. Non-performing loans decreased from June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the full payoff of two loan relationships with a recorded investment of $3.0 million and due to a partial charge-off of $700 thousand related to a commercial real estate credit in which a specific valuation allowance was recorded in the prior fiscal year. The allowance for loan losses (ALLL) as a percent of total loans at March 31, 2017 was 1.24% and annualized net charge-offs to total loans were 0.35% for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017 compared with an ALLL to loans ratio of 1.08% and an annualized net charge-off ratio of 0.10% for the same period last year.

	The information contained in this press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond Consumers’ control and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. Although Consumers believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Consumers can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. The forward-looking statements included in this discussion speak only as of the date they are made, and, except as required by law, Consumers undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements and that could adversely affect Consumers’ performance include, but are not limited to: material unforeseen changes in the financial condition or results of Consumers National Bank’s customers; the economic impact from the oil and gas activity in the region could be less than expected or the timeline for development could be longer than anticipated; regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality of assets and the underlying value of collateral could prove to be less valuable than otherwise assumed or debtors being unable to meet their obligations; an extended period in which market levels of interest rates remain at historical low levels which could reduce, or put pressure on our ability to maintain, anticipated or actual margins; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; pricing and liquidity pressures that may result in a rising market rate environment; and the nature, extent, and timing of government and regulatory actions.
