Home > COMPANY > HistoryHistory
Iowa farmer Arthur Luscombe founded Art’s Way Manufacturing in 1956, to produce and sell a PTO powered grinder mixer he developed on his farm near Dolliver, Iowa. His first product was a great success that marked the beginning of his amazing career as an inventor and entrepreneur. In 1959, Luscombe moved the company from his original plant in downtown Armstrong to its present location, and the grinder mixer line was expanded to include OEM work for companies such as Massey Ferguson, Owatonna and Case or as it was known then, International Harvester.
Today, Art’s Way has approximately 200 employees and operates its 4 business units in 7 facilities. Arthur Luscombe’s dedication to innovation, quality and durability remains the central focus of our products and business practices. We take pride in the quality of our grinder mixers, sugar beet harvesters, graders, plows and other farm machinery, and continue to expand our product lines to meet the needs of our customers.
The timeline below highlights some interesting milestones in the Art’s Way story, through more than fifty years of service to the farming and cattle industries.

1960's
1966
Art’s Way acquires the Silamix product line, a chain mix feed wagon. A line of scales is added to the product offerings, allowing livestock producers to accurately measure feed ingredients. This new venture is organized under the brand name WeighTronix, and scale systems are designed to adapt to grinder mixers and Silamixes, as well as platform and industrial applications.

1970's
1970’s
Art’s Way becomes a publically traded entity upon its initial public offering.

1980's
1980’s
Art’s Way acquires the Sunmaster line from Rotech. This move adds mowers, cutters and shredders to the company’s product offerings. The Heath Farm Equipment line is also purchased, allowing Art’s Way to begin manufacturing sugar beet harvesters and defoliators.
The company secures the patent rights to the John Deere design “wheel” harvester, and soon becomes the industry leader in that market. A potato harvester, previously available only in the Red River Valley, North Carolina and Canada, is also introduced to the product line.
The WeighTronix division, created to build scales for Art’s Way grinder mixers, is spun off from Art’s Way.
The Armstrong Rim & Wheel division, created to build wheels for Art’s Way grinder mixers, is spun off from Art’s Way.

1990's
1990’s
Art’s Way acquires the Peerless line, and begins offering a roller mill in feed processing products. Stationary feed processing/mixing equipment is also added.
The Eversman product line is purchased, bringing land preparation equipment (planes, levelers, ditchers, scrapers) to the product offerings as well the PreSeeder, a minimum tillage tool.
The SupRaMix TMR vertical mixer is added to target the dairy and beef markets, and the SSP 150 is introduced, adding a portable roller mixer designed exclusively for the hog producer.
Art’s Way acquires the Logan Company line, and expands potato offerings to include a planter, windrower, and additional harvester, as well as a line of bulk boxes.
The DMI design grain wagon is incorporated into the product line, along with several lines purchased from United Farm Tool. They include the no till grain drill, the “Speedy” bean cutter, the multi crop shredder and the high dump wagon.

2000's
2000
Art’s Way begins producing the Landstar/KanAm pull type grader, which complements the Eversman land preparation product line. A 9, 12, and 14 foot model is introduced to the marketplace.
2002
J. Ward McConnell, Jr. becomes Chairman of the Board and sets the course for a new era at Art’s Way that will include a new focus on growth and diversification via acquisition as well as a renewed concentration in the area of research and development for Art’s Way products.
2004
Art’s Way introduces its newly developed, state of the art 12 row sugar beet harvester, the 6812, featuring unprecedented capacity and efficiency. Its performance remains unparalleled and makes the 6812 the market leader.
2005
The Art’s Way farm equipment division introduces a new industry leading grinder mixer, the 5165, featuring the largest capacity and greatest efficiency of any grinder mixer in the marketplace.
Art’s Way diversifies by creating the new Art’s Way Vessels division in Dubuque, Iowa, to manufacture pressure vessels and other custom steel products.
2006
Art’s Way celebrates its 50th anniversary with a special celebration in Armstrong, Iowa honoring the company’s long time employees and its special guest, founder Arthur Luscombe.
Art’s Way diversifies its business by creating the new Art’s Way Scientific division in Monona, Iowa. This division manufactures modular laboratories for research and other purposes.
Art’s Way embarks on its first campaign to actively export its products by exhibiting at farm equipment expositions in Europe.
2007
The Art’s Way farm equipment division expands its product offering with the acquisition of the venerated MillerPro and Badger hay and forage equipment product lines. New products include forage boxes, forage blowers, hay rakes, and mergers, among others.
The Board of Directors names Carrie Majeski President and CEO of Art’s Way after several years as CFO of the company.
2008
Art’s Way Scientific celebrates the opening of its brand new, state of the art manufacturing facility in Monona, Iowa.
Art’s Way Vessels also celebrates the opening of a brand new, state of the art manufacturing facility in Dubuque, Iowa.
Art’s Way founder Arthur Luscombe passes away at the age of 86.
Art’s Way is recognized by Fortune Small Business magazine as the 57th best small market cap company in America. Months later, Art’s Way is recognized by Forbes magazine as the 54th best small company in America.
Art’s Way expands its farm equipment product offering with the founding of Art’s Way Auger in Salem, South Dakota for the purpose of entering the grain auger manufacturing business.

2010's
2010
The Art’s Way farm equipment division expands its product offering, with the acquisition of Roda manure spreaders and M&W balers, and doubling the product offering within the auger line. 
Art’s Way purchases facility in Salem South Dakota for auger production.
Art’s Way purchases facility in West Union, IA. This new facility allows room for the continued expansion of the Art’s Way farm equipment product offering.
2012
The Art’s Way farm equipment division expands its product offering again, with the acquisition of Universal Harvester Company. Universal Harvester by Art’s Way manufactures reels for combines and swathers.
2013
Art’s Way purchases AgroTrend in Clifford, Ontario. AgroTrend produces and distributes their own line of snow blowers as well as a line of dump carts. They also represent products from other manufacturers. We believe this acquisition will allow us stronger opportunity in the Canadian markets, with sales people dedicated to selling all Art’s Way products. The AgroTrend blower will be marketed in both the US and Canada.
Art’s Way diversifies its business with the acquisition of Ohio Metal Co. Inc. in Canton, Ohio. Ohio Metal manufactures carbide cutting tools under the name American Carbide Tools (ACT)


Present
Today Art’s Way continues to seek opportunities to grow organically and diversify by acquisition. The company maintains a focus on continually improving its products, introducing new products, expanding within existing markets, and entering new and diverse areas of business. Art’s Way remains an OEM supplier to Case New Holland and H&S Mfg. and markets its own products under Art’s Way, MillerPro, AgroTrend and Universal Harvester brands.

Arts Way Manufacturing Co., Inc.
Headquartered in Armstrong, IA, in June 2013, purchased the inventory and assets of Agro Trend, a manufacturer and distributor of agricultural snow blowers, trailers, and running gears in Clifford, Ontario, Canada. With more than 30 years experience building snow blowers, you can be assured of a high quality blower. This acquisition extended the distribution of Art’s Way products into Canada as part of a long-term growth strategy to expand their product mix and North American dealer network.
Art’s Way dealers in the United States now have the ability to sell and distribute Agro Trend Snow Blowers. Products targeted for Canadian growth include forage equipment, grinders, and manure spreaders. This new product mix and Canadian dealer network brings Art’s Way greater operational capabilities and synergies.

         Pull-Behind Blowers 
5000 Series by Arts Way- Affordable – Efficient – Reliable
      
Pull-behind blowers are designed for convenience and operator comfort. These blowers allow forward travel while blowing. This is a very cost effective alternative to a front mount blower. Built from the same time proven components as our regular 3pth blowers. Pull Behind blowers are available with hydraulic orbital turners only.
5160 – 5 Ft – Compact Blower for Compact tractors with category 1- 3pth.
5272 – 6 Ft – Standard Blower for larger Compact tractors with category 1- 3pth.
5384 – 7 Ft – Farm Utility Blower for midsized utility tractors with Category 2 – 3pth.

       Turners for all Pull-Behind Models
              HOT.11PBH Hydraulic orbital hood turner allows changing the direction of the discharge spout from the tractor seat. Simple clean design uses common components as our regular blowers.
Hydraulic Turner must be added to complete Blower Package

     Options
5160 and 5272

Commercial Forage Box added to hay/forage equipment lineup
NOVEMBER 11, 2016

Combining size with strength, Art’s Way’s new heavy-duty commercial forage box is designed with the commercial farmer and livestock producer in mind.
“The new forage box has a rugged, robust design, the materials it’s made of are chosen for their durability,” said Guadalupe Diaz, design sales engineer at Art’s Way. “It will provide years of trouble free life.”
Stable, smooth ride
The forage wagon box is designed for a stable, smooth ride as well. The chassis features three-ply springs for excellent stability when going up a hillside or along a highway. Cross members are integrated into both walls of the frame to eliminate twisting action.
In extremely wet conditions, 52-inch axle spacing accommodates larger tires with adequate clearance to prevent mud from locking up the tires.
A modified center spring rocker allows 50 percent more axle movement compared to conventional over-the-road spring ride systems found under competing boxes. Drum brakes on all four wheels deliver unsurpassed stopping capability. Hydraulically actuated, the brakes can be used with tractor brake valves or standard tractor remote.
A swivel hitch with adjustable height fits any drawbar configuration. An approximate 2,800-lb hitch weight when empty provides exceptionally smooth trailing and handling as well as eliminates drawbar “slapping” when loading the wagon from back to front.
Space between the chassis and the forage box was kept at a minimum to maintain a low center of gravity for better handling.
The forage box is an all-welded design for greater strength and features #4 polished stainless steel sides. Not only is the stainless steel much stronger than a corrugated steel design, it doesn’t rust in the acidic environment of forage harvest.
Made from ¾-inch Densilite poly, the floor is impervious to moisture and acid and expands and contract very little. The floor is fastened to the frame with stainless steel hardware. Epoxy primer extends the life of painted components.
The new commercial forage box has both front and rear unload.
The front unload system has four aggressive spiral-type beater bars with long tines to deliver controlled crop flow and prevent the cross apron from filling during loading. This system allows more filling in the forage box front area.
Spring-loaded beater drive chains and apron chains make for smooth action. Greasable beater bearings are banked together for easy maintenance and long life.
An optional cross apron extension is integrated into front unload system with a sequence valve for automatic and convenient operation, preventing the cross apron from moving with the extension in transport position.
The scale option provides 4 point measuring for high accuracy product tracking. A hydraulic rear tailgate opens automatically when rear unload hydraulics are engaged. It pivots up away from crop to ensure unhindered discharge of material. Oil lines to rear unload are 3/4 –inch to provide high-speed discharge. Depending upon tractor capability, unloading can be done in 60 seconds or less.
The tailgate functions completely on hydraulics, eliminating the need for a latching mechanism. Poly bushings on the pivot arm provide a low maintenance durable connection for operation.
For more information about its new commercial forage boxes, please contact Art’s Way via phone, email 1-519-418-8005 • sales@artswayinternational.com

High Dump Cart is designed to speed up beet harvest
NOVEMBER 10, 2016

The new 9016-BT High Dump Cart from Art’s Way was specifically designed to boost efficiency during the beet harvest.
The 9016-BT wheel base is set so the tires can run through the field without damaging unlifted beets.  The 15-inch wide tires, centered on 132 inches, straddle six rows of beets.  The cart features a large, 20-ton capacity and can be easily set to dump to the left or right side.  When combined, these features allow the 9016-BT to be pulled alongside the 6812D Harvester using a High Speed Defoliator when opening and dump back to the left when full.  This allows the harvester to run at a much more continuous pace, greatly reducing the amount of lost time.
The walking tandem is designed with 20 degree of total rotation for smooth transport over uneven terrain.  The cart is available with a scale system that includes a Wi-Fi antenna.  The Wi-Fi antenna allows the harvester operator to instantly monitor the load from any smart device.  This feature is very helpful when trying to maximize truck loads.
“The 9016-BT Cart was designed specifically for the beet harvest.” said Neil Whitman, a sales engineer at Art’s Way. “We worked directly with customers and dealers to get the most out of this design.  Improving efficiency without sacrificing durability was our main goal.”
Other features of the 9016-BT include a heavy duty, height adjustable, pivoting 2-inch hitch and three-position telescoping tongue. For safety, rear and side LED marker lights are standard.
In addition to sugar beets, the high dump cart can also be used for edible beans, peanuts, cotton, corn and soybeans.
The 9016-BT High Dump Cart is ruggedly built and easy to maintain for years of trouble-free use.
The new 9016-BT High Dump Cart by Art’s Way is competitively priced to make it a worthwhile investment for your beet operation.
For more information about the 9016-BT High Dump Cart, please contact Art’s Way via phone, email 1-519-418-8005 • sales@artswayinternational.com

Hammer Blower is a hammermill and forage blower, combined all in one unit
NOVEMBER 9, 2016

Combining a powerful, hammermill with a high capacity, blower fan, Art’s Way’s new Hammer Blower is a versatile machine that can grind high moisture shelled or ear corn and blow the mixture up into a silo or bunk too.
This machine can grind dry corn through a 1/8-inch screen directly into a truck with virtually no dust.
Providing further flexibility, the Hammer Blower has a vent adjustment that allows changing between silo feeding and bagging.
“Based on our proven designs, the new Art’s Way Hammer Blower not only saves equipment cost, it combines two operations to reduce processing time during the harvest,” said Ron Bender, North East Regional Sales Manager of Art’s Way. “We expect it to be very popular among feedlot owners.”
Processing shell or ear corn improves kernel digestibility, especially when kernels are mature. Processors also break the cobs to increase cob consumption. The crushing process also improves silo compaction, allowing for increased capacity.
Combining a mill with a blower is an ideal setup because it can process the corn before blowing it into silos or bags.
Corn goes into a hopper in the back of the Hammer Blower and then up through an auger before dropping into the powerful hammermill. From there, the ground corn is sent through the 42-inch blower fan where the vent can adjusted to either go up a tube to the silo or to a bagging operation.
The Hammer Blower has a capacity of 1-ton per minute. It has capability to reach the tallest silos. Powered by a tractor PTO, both the hammermill and the blower operate at 1000 rpm and require a minimum of 80 hp.
The Hammer Blower’s applications are changed without tools. The machine is rugged and easy to maintain.
Contact Art’s Way for more information about its new Hammer Blower via phone, email: 1-519-418-8005  •  sales@artswayinternational.com
