Funeral Flowers, Condolence Flowers and Gifts
Send Flowers and Gifts for a Funeral Service
The passing of a loved one can be one of the most difficult times that your family and friends may ever face. Show your sympathy by sending a funeral flower arrangementor gift basket sent to the service, the office, or home of your loved ones, friends or coworkers. Many of our funeral flower arrangements include lilies, orchids, roses, carnations and more. Flowers are an excellent way to express your sympathy while giving the loved ones of the departed a beautiful reminder of the love and support that surrounds them. Whether you decide to send a beautiful standing spray or wreath to the service or a simple and elegant sympathy bouquet to the home, 1-800-Flowers has options for every need and budget.

    Sympathy Gift Baskets and Gourmet Food
Sending condolence flowers to someone or a group who is grieving can be a strong reminder of the recipient's support network and all of the people who care about them. Gift baskets and gourmet food baskets can be an excellent alternative to the traditional gift of flowers and in some religious funeral traditions, may even be a more appropriate sympathy gift than flowers. Sympathy gift baskets offer multiple options and variety to brighten any home when in mourning. Choose 1-800-Flowers for your sympathy gift and funeral flower needs to make sure you can express your sympathy and offer comfort for those that are grieving.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
The concept of using the word "flowers" within a Phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin and was used for that company until 1981. Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a corporation which began to use that number to sell flowers in 1982. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. In turn, this new corporation struggled financially as well.[1] Its assets were acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.[2]
Growth in prominence[edit]
In the early 1990s, two events helped bring 1-800-Flowers to national prominence. First, AT&T created an advertising campaign featuring the company that aired repeatedly during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[2] Second, at the time of the first Persian Gulf War, many advertisers were pulling out of CNN, unaware that CNN's war coverage would draw additional viewers. 1-800-Flowers agreed to remain as an advertiser at founder Ted Turner's request.[2]
The company was among the first retailers to partner with CompuServe and AOL, in 1992 and 1994 respectively. On September 1, 1995, the company registered the 1800flowers.com domain name.[3] In 1999, the company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLWS and changed its name to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, to match its web site address.
Recent development[edit]
The company has merged with or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies. In September 2007, the company announced a partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to produce a line of floral products inspired by Martha Stewart.[4] In August 2011, the company acquired Flowerama, a Waterloo-based floral retailer with 100 locations in 28 states.[5]
According to the Consumerist in 2008, customers have reported unknowingly being subscribed to LiveWell after receiving rebate checks from 1-800-flowers.[6]
It had 4,000 employees as of 2008, with a market cap of $119 Million USD.[7]
In 2009, revenue was US$714 Million.[8] Operating income wasUS$-72.2 Million,[8] net income was US$-98.4 Million,[8] assets were valued at US$286 Million,[9] and equity was at US$134 Million.[9]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
The concept of using the word "flowers" within a Phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin and was used for that company until 1981. Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a corporation which began to use that number to sell flowers in 1982. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. In turn, this new corporation struggled financially as well.[1] Its assets were acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.[2]
Growth in prominence[edit]
In the early 1990s, two events helped bring 1-800-Flowers to national prominence. First, AT&T created an advertising campaign featuring the company that aired repeatedly during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[2] Second, at the time of the first Persian Gulf War, many advertisers were pulling out of CNN, unaware that CNN's war coverage would draw additional viewers. 1-800-Flowers agreed to remain as an advertiser at founder Ted Turner's request.[2]
The company was among the first retailers to partner with CompuServe and AOL, in 1992 and 1994 respectively. On September 1, 1995, the company registered the 1800flowers.com domain name.[3] In 1999, the company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLWS and changed its name to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, to match its web site address.
Recent development[edit]
The company has merged with or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies. In September 2007, the company announced a partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to produce a line of floral products inspired by Martha Stewart.[4] In August 2011, the company acquired Flowerama, a Waterloo-based floral retailer with 100 locations in 28 states.[5]
According to the Consumerist in 2008, customers have reported unknowingly being subscribed to LiveWell after receiving rebate checks from 1-800-flowers.[6]
It had 4,000 employees as of 2008, with a market cap of $119 Million USD.[7]
In 2009, revenue was US$714 Million.[8] Operating income wasUS$-72.2 Million,[8] net income was US$-98.4 Million,[8] assets were valued at US$286 Million,[9] and equity was at US$134 Million.[9]

1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. Reports Fannie May Fine Chocolates And Harry London Chocolates Product Constraints Due To A Thanksgiving Day Fire at its Maple Heights, Ohio Warehouse and Distribution Facility | Business Wire


























































1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. Reports Fannie May Fine Chocolates And Harry 
      London Chocolates Product Constraints Due To A Thanksgiving Day Fire at 
      its Maple Heights, Ohio Warehouse and Distribution Facility






November 29, 2014 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



CARLE PLACE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., the world’s leading florist and gift shop, 
      today reported that supplies of its Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry 
      London Chocolates will be limited this holiday season due to a fire at 
      the Company’s Maple Heights, Ohio warehouse and distribution facility 
      that took place on Thanksgiving Day. While the fire did not cause any 
      injuries, the building was severely damaged, rendering it inoperable for 
      the key holiday season. Inventories stored at the facility for 
      distribution, including such iconic products as Fannie May Pixies and 
      Trinidads, were damaged or lost in the fire.
    

      As a result of the lost inventories and the impact to distribution 
      operations, the Company expects to have limited supplies of its Fannie 
      May Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolate products available in its 
      retail stores as well as for its ecommerce and wholesale channels during 
      the holiday season. The Company has begun to implement contingency plans 
      to increase production for Fannie May Fine Chocolates and Harry London 
      Chocolates products at its state-of-the-art chocolate and confection 
      production facility in Canton, Ohio and to shift warehousing and 
      distribution operations to alternate Company facilities as well as 
      identifying additional third-party facilities to handle holiday demand. 
      While the constrained inventory is likely to impact total revenues for 
      the holiday season, the Company is insured for losses incurred due to 
      the fire, including material losses and business interruption.
    

      Jim McCann, CEO of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., parent company of Fannie May 
      Fine Chocolates and Harry London Chocolates, said: “First and foremost, 
      we are very thankful that no one was injured by the fire at our Maple 
      Heights facility and we are extremely grateful to the Maple Heights fire 
      department and other first responders for its rapid response and 
      diligent efforts in fighting the fire on Thanksgiving Day. I am also 
      proud of the tremendous response and positive spirit of our dedicated 
      associates throughout the Company who worked through the Thanksgiving 
      holiday and continue to work around the clock to develop and implement 
      contingency plans to accelerate production and identify alternate 
      warehouse and distribution options so that we can minimize the impact of 
      this unfortunate event on our business and, most important, on our 
      ability to help our customers deliver smiles this holiday season.”

Business challenge story
Using a diverse set of order management systems 
After years of expanding its business and acquiring other leading online retail brands, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM was working with a diverse array of order management systems. “When you grow through acquisition, you often adopt homegrown tools from the acquired brands,” says Leslie Leifer, vice president of e-commerce and product development at 1-800-FLOWERS.COM. “Part of the natural growth cycle is eventually building something that can be more easily leveraged for the future.”








“The IBM Cloud solution will establish one high-performance platform that supports the needs of all our brands.”
—Leslie Leifer, Vice President of E-Commerce and Product Development, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM Inc.
                                                            







To consolidate order fulfillment processes on one integrated platform, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM sought a cloud-based solution. “We’re always looking for new technologies to enhance our business,” says Leifer. “Cloud is the cutting-edge tool we need to create opportunities and grow in the future.”














Transformation story
Moving to an IBM Commerce on Cloud platform
Evaluating several leading cloud providers, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM chose an IBM Cloud solution. “It’s important for us to work with a company that can be our partner and isn’t just a vendor,” says Leifer. “IBM has been that for us historically, and we look for it to be that in the future.”
IBM will lead 1-800-FLOWERS.COM’s substantial migration project, moving the retailer’s 10 major brands to an IBM Commerce on Cloud platform running in an IBM Bluemix  cloud environment. “It’s an immense effort,” says Leifer. “But the IBM Cloud solution will establish one high-performance platform that supports the needs of all our brands.”

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
The concept of using the word "flowers" within a Phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin and was used for that company until 1981. Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a corporation which began to use that number to sell flowers in 1982. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. In turn, this new corporation struggled financially as well.[1] Its assets were acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.[2]
Growth in prominence[edit]
In the early 1990s, two events helped bring 1-800-Flowers to national prominence. First, AT&T created an advertising campaign featuring the company that aired repeatedly during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[2] Second, at the time of the first Persian Gulf War, many advertisers were pulling out of CNN, unaware that CNN's war coverage would draw additional viewers. 1-800-Flowers agreed to remain as an advertiser at founder Ted Turner's request.[2]
The company was among the first retailers to partner with CompuServe and AOL, in 1992 and 1994 respectively. On September 1, 1995, the company registered the 1800flowers.com domain name.[3] In 1999, the company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLWS and changed its name to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, to match its web site address.
Recent development[edit]
The company has merged with or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies. In September 2007, the company announced a partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to produce a line of floral products inspired by Martha Stewart.[4] In August 2011, the company acquired Flowerama, a Waterloo-based floral retailer with 100 locations in 28 states.[5]
According to the Consumerist in 2008, customers have reported unknowingly being subscribed to LiveWell after receiving rebate checks from 1-800-flowers.[6]
It had 4,000 employees as of 2008, with a market cap of $119 Million USD.[7]
In 2009, revenue was US$714 Million.[8] Operating income wasUS$-72.2 Million,[8] net income was US$-98.4 Million,[8] assets were valued at US$286 Million,[9] and equity was at US$134 Million.[9]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
The concept of using the word "flowers" within a Phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin and was used for that company until 1981. Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a corporation which began to use that number to sell flowers in 1982. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. In turn, this new corporation struggled financially as well.[1] Its assets were acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.[2]
Growth in prominence[edit]
In the early 1990s, two events helped bring 1-800-Flowers to national prominence. First, AT&T created an advertising campaign featuring the company that aired repeatedly during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[2] Second, at the time of the first Persian Gulf War, many advertisers were pulling out of CNN, unaware that CNN's war coverage would draw additional viewers. 1-800-Flowers agreed to remain as an advertiser at founder Ted Turner's request.[2]
The company was among the first retailers to partner with CompuServe and AOL, in 1992 and 1994 respectively. On September 1, 1995, the company registered the 1800flowers.com domain name.[3] In 1999, the company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLWS and changed its name to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, to match its web site address.
Recent development[edit]
The company has merged with or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies. In September 2007, the company announced a partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to produce a line of floral products inspired by Martha Stewart.[4] In August 2011, the company acquired Flowerama, a Waterloo-based floral retailer with 100 locations in 28 states.[5]
According to the Consumerist in 2008, customers have reported unknowingly being subscribed to LiveWell after receiving rebate checks from 1-800-flowers.[6]
It had 4,000 employees as of 2008, with a market cap of $119 Million USD.[7]
In 2009, revenue was US$714 Million.[8] Operating income wasUS$-72.2 Million,[8] net income was US$-98.4 Million,[8] assets were valued at US$286 Million,[9] and equity was at US$134 Million.[9]

From the very moment you hear of a loss you can send a fresh bouquet, plant, or standing arrangement to any location through 1-800-Flowers.com. Same-day sympathy flowers are designed to let them know that you care and support them during this difficult period in life. Even when you can't be there in person, a well-thought out flower arrangement or plant can serve as a constant reminder of your presence within their hearts. When you need to send sympathy flowers the very same day, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM® can help you send an appropriate and thoughtful gift.
Sending the Perfect Sympathy Flowers
When selecting same-day sympathy flowers you can choose from a variety of bouquets that are appropriate for homes, offices, and funerals. Traditionally, sympathy flowers are designed with a variety of fresh white flowers including white roses, spider mums, carnations, snapdragons and other pale stems. Vibrant red, white, yellow, purple, or pink combinations are also appropriate and help to infuse color and life during an otherwise painful time. Depending on the funeral service you can choose from a wide assortment of quality standing sprays, wreaths, floor baskets, standing baskets, and tableside arrangements. Other options, including elegant floor or basket plants, can become a long-lasting reminder of your support well after the services have ended.
1-800-FLOWERS.COM® is available to support and assistance you during your purchase process. Same-day sympathy flowers can be sent in minutes through a reliable and secure site designed to help you choose the most appropriate flowers to express your condolences. You can rest assure that your flowers will arrive to your destination to let them know you care. If the day arrives that you must choose sympathy flowers for a friend, family member, or colleague let 1-800-Flowers.com guide you and help you send the very best flowers and plants.

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
The concept of using the word "flowers" within a Phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin and was used for that company until 1981. Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a corporation which began to use that number to sell flowers in 1982. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. In turn, this new corporation struggled financially as well.[1] Its assets were acquired in 1986 by Jim McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.[2]
Growth in prominence[edit]
In the early 1990s, two events helped bring 1-800-Flowers to national prominence. First, AT&T created an advertising campaign featuring the company that aired repeatedly during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[2] Second, at the time of the first Persian Gulf War, many advertisers were pulling out of CNN, unaware that CNN's war coverage would draw additional viewers. 1-800-Flowers agreed to remain as an advertiser at founder Ted Turner's request.[2]
The company was among the first retailers to partner with CompuServe and AOL, in 1992 and 1994 respectively. On September 1, 1995, the company registered the 1800flowers.com domain name.[3] In 1999, the company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol FLWS and changed its name to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, to match its web site address.
Recent development[edit]
The company has merged with or acquired a number of other gift and retailing companies. In September 2007, the company announced a partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia to produce a line of floral products inspired by Martha Stewart.[4] In August 2011, the company acquired Flowerama, a Waterloo-based floral retailer with 100 locations in 28 states.[5]
According to the Consumerist in 2008, customers have reported unknowingly being subscribed to LiveWell after receiving rebate checks from 1-800-flowers.[6]
It had 4,000 employees as of 2008, with a market cap of $119 Million USD.[7]
In 2009, revenue was US$714 Million.[8] Operating income wasUS$-72.2 Million,[8] net income was US$-98.4 Million,[8] assets were valued at US$286 Million,[9] and equity was at US$134 Million.[9]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
