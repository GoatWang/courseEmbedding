Since 1892, Bank Mutual has been helping people succeed.

Bank Mutual Corporation is the holding company of Bank Mutual – a successful, FDIC insured banking institution in Wisconsin for 125 years.
The Largest Bank Headquartered in Milwaukee
In today’s tough economic environment, we continue to look for ways to better serve our customers and deliver on our promise of helping people go farther.  We believe in running an efficient operation with a highly productive staff, helping us to create a stable working environment while providing continuity of service to our customers.

We’re proud that our strong fundamentals have meant that we’ve never had to accept a capital infusion under the government’s Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP).  Today, we’re the largest bank based in Milwaukee and our over 60 bank offices serve more than 100,000 households throughout Wisconsin with one office in Minnesota.
Your Local Bank
For our retail customers, we’re spending time, energy and dollars to improve the customer experience in our bank office network. We’re focused on providing financial solutions that offer added value above and beyond traditional banking products. We do this through our traditional bank offices, our internet banking, our surcharge-free nationwide network of over 23,000 ATMs, and our subsidiary, Mutual Financial Group, which offers annuities and securities.
Creating Commercial Success Through Expert Bankers
It’s our philosophy to look beyond the numbers when evaluating potential business customers. We have an increased focus on developing our team of seasoned bankers to deliver a full complement of financial solutions to help our commercial clients with revenues of $5 million to $100 million become more successful. These businesses appreciate our local, responsive decision-making and the added value we bring.
Core Strengths
Bank Mutual Corporation’s core strengths include a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, diversified product offerings, a statewide franchise of community-oriented bank offices, strong local decision making, and dedicated associates providing quality customer service.

We Continue To Live Our Brand Promise - We’re Wisconsin people, using our understanding of money to help people make their way in life.

Bank Mutual (NASDAQ:BKMU)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Monday 24 July 2017



NEW YORK, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Bank Mutual Corporation ("BKMU" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: BKMU) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Associated Banc-Corp ("ASB") (NYSE: ASB).  Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive 0.422 of a share of ASB for each BKMU share they own, representing consideration of $9.85 based on ASB's July 21 closing price.   
WeissLaw is investigating whether BKMU's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  Notably, prior to the acquisition announcement, at least one analyst set a target price of $11.00 per share.  Additionally, BKMU shares traded at $10.20 as recently as February of this year.  
Moreover, according to the acquisition announcement, "[a]s a result of this transaction, [ASB] will strengthen its Wisconsin network and expand services into nearly a dozen additional communities."
Given these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether BKMU's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and future growth prospects.  If you own BKMU shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com.   
WeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.  We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.  If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/bank-mutual-corporation/

Important Information about Revenue Sharing Arrangements
U.S. Bancorp Investments (“USBI”) routinely receives compensation for the sale of financial products, including mutual funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), variable and fixed annuities, and variable and fixed life insurance.  The compensation provided to USBI depends upon the product.  In addition to sales loads, 12b-1 fees, networking and processing fees, USBI receives mutual fund support fees, which are sometimes referred to as “revenue sharing” payments, from the advisers or distributors of mutual funds that have access to USBI‘s investment professionals, as described below.  Similarly, in addition to the commissions paid to USBI in connection with the sales of annuities and life insurance, USBI receives support fees from certain insurance companies or distributors.  Again, these insurance companies and distributors (if applicable) have access to USBI‘s investment professionals, as described below.
Financial Revenue Sharing from Product Partners to USBI
Many financial products are made available in the marketplace.  To assist our clients in choosing the product that is right for them, USBI utilizes a formal due diligence process to evaluate firms who offer a broad array of financial products, selecting only those matching our required criteria.  Following this due diligence process, our investment professionals make recommendations from among this wide range of approved products based upon the specific investment objectives, risk tolerances, and time horizons of their clients and subject to broker-dealer suitability requirements.
USBI has entered into agreements through which certain firms (our “Product Partners”) provide financial contributions to USBI which are used to support the marketing of their products, training of our investment professionals, and for other purposes.  Product Partners may also reimburse USBI for expenses incurred during training and educational conferences and seminars, and for providing client accounting and administrative services for USBI‘s client accounts holding the products of the Product Partner.  In addition, USBI employees, including investment professionals, may receive promotional items, meals or entertainment, or other non-cash compensation from the Product Partners. 
In exchange for sharing revenue, these Product Partners are provided enhanced access to USBI‘s distribution network and greater opportunities to participate in marketing and training functions.  Investment professionals do not, however, receive any portion of, or any additional cash compensation as a result of these revenue and cost sharing arrangements.  It is important to note that not all product providers approved by USBI make financial contributions to USBI. 
All of the above-referenced financial contributions are in addition to any sales charges or commissions that may be disclosed in the fee tables found in the prospectuses and statements of additional information for the mutual fund or in your annuity or insurance contract.  
Mutual Funds - Revenue Sharing Payments
Financial contributions from USBI Mutual Fund Product Partners may include revenue-sharing arrangements.  The revenue sharing payments made to USBI by a Mutual Fund Product Partner may consist of: (1) an annual, lump-sum payment; (2) a percentage of the total amount of mutual fund sales made by USBI for that fund family ("mutual fund sales-based fee"); and/or (3) a percentage of the total net assets of the mutual fund shares of that fund family held by USBI customers ("mutual fund asset-based fee").
The amount and type of revenue sharing payments received from a Mutual Fund Product Partner may vary and is subject to negotiation.  Revenue sharing payments are generally in the following amounts: 


Mutual Fund Sales-Based Fee
Up to 0.25% (paid quarterly) on sales of mutual fund shares (e.g., $25 per $10,000 purchase).


Mutual Fund Asset-Based Fee
Up to 0.05% per year (calculated and paid quarterly) of the net assets of all mutual fund shares of a particular Product Partner held through USBI (e.g., $5 per $10,000 in net assets of shares).


Insurance/Annuities - Revenue Sharing Payments
Financial contributions from USBI Insurance or Annuity Product Partners may include revenue-sharing arrangements.  The revenue sharing payments made to USBI by an Insurance or Annuity Product Partner may consist of: (1) an annual, lump-sum payment; (2) a percentage of the total amount of gross insurance or annuity sales made by USBI for the insurance company ("annuity sales-based fee") and/or (3) a percentage of the aggregate value of insurance or annuity assets invested in contracts for which USBI is designated as the broker or agent of record by the insurance company or annuity provider ("annuity asset-based fee").
The amount and type of revenue sharing payments received from an Insurance or Annuity Product Partner may vary and is subject to negotiation.  Revenue sharing payments are generally in the following amounts: 


Insurance or Annuity Sales-Based Fee
Up to 0.21% (paid quarterly) on sales of insurance or annuities (e.g., $21 per $10,000 purchase).


Insurance or Annuity Asset-Based Fee
Up to 0.05% per year (calculated and paid quarterly) of the net assets of all insurance or annuity assets of a particular Product Partner where USBI is the broker or agent of record (e.g., $5 per $10,000 in net assets of shares).


Potential Conflicts of Interest from Financial Revenue Sharing 
A potential conflict of interest exists where USBI is paid more in revenue sharing if you purchase one type of product instead of another.  A potential conflict of interest may also exist if one Product Partner provides more in financial contributions over another.  USBI may offer products that USBI or its affiliates may underwrite, or may otherwise be financially interested in a primary or secondary distribution.  USBI may also offer products which involve entities with a relationship with USBI and/or its affiliates.  USBI may receive compensation or other benefits for selling such products.  
USBI is committed to serving our clients' interests first, so we have adopted policies reasonably designed to control and limit these potential conflicts of interest.  The policies require investment professionals to recommend products and services based only on their appropriateness in meeting your investment goals.  The policies prohibit the payment of any portion of revenue or cost sharing fees directly to investment professionals.  In addition, revenue-sharing payments must be made by the distributor or the product provider by wire transfer or check, and policies prohibit the acceptance of these payments in the form of direct or indirect investment portfolio commissions of the product sponsor.  
Product Partners 
A list of all Product Partners that have made financial contributions to USBI, ranked in order of financial contributions for the prior 12 months as of May 31, 2017, is included below:
