Hot Red Rocket

Steamin’ down the skyway ‘tween Deimos an’ Mars
Lookin’ out the window at a sky full o’ stars
Cruisin’ with my lady an’ I’m tryin’ to be seen
In my hot red rocket...
With the star-bright sheen
(Chorus)
Hot red rocket, star-bright sheen
Never has there been any rocket so mean!
Whoa, whoa! Hot red rocket, star-bright sheen
Cruisin’ with my lady...
In her tight blue jeans
Tight blue jeans
Oh them tight, tight, tight, tight blue jeans

Carl Perkins #5 hit, June 1959

In 1949, a Swiss research team invents the Solothurn Engine, AKA the Corkscrew drive. The Soviet spy Emil Fuchs turns over the plans to the Soviets, and the race to the stars is on!

StarCluster 4 - Cold Space covers the years 1949 - 1989 in an alternate universe, where the Cold War is fought in space as well as on the ground.

StarCluster 4 - Cold Space is self contained, and does not require any other StarCluster 4 product to use.

5 Things You Need To Know About EPA '07
Tuesday, October 10, 2006





									1.	EPA MANDATES NITROGEN OXIDE AND PARTICULATE MATTERS BE REDUCED.  -	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has mandated that all engines built after 12/31/06 must reduce the level of Nitrogen Oxides and other particulate matter below current levels. The Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) exhausted by the engine will be limited to just over 1.0 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr).

Lindsey Bauman/The Associated PressMcKay High School product Ryan Bailey (545), competing for Rend Lake (Ill.) at the national junior college championships, is in the field for the 100 meters at Sunday's Prefontaine Classic. Track & Field News has ranked him in the top 10 in the United States in the 100 and 200.
Ryan Bailey became a professional track athlete this week, but he wasn't sure Friday afternoon what logo he might wear on his spikes at Sunday's Prefontaine Classic. 
It's been a whirlwind week for the Salem sprinter, who broke Oregon high school records two years ago competing for McKay High School.
He has risen from a life of obscurity and poverty to become one of the hottest prospects in U.S. track and field. He is entered in the 100 meters in the Prefontaine Classic.
"What kid doesn't dream about becoming a professional athlete?" Bailey said from his mother's home in Salem. "I can't even explain it. It's a dream come true." 
Last Saturday, Bailey took a 24-hour trip to New York to meet with agents and shoe company executives, and on Tuesday he met with another agent in Portland. 
The Oregonian/2007Bailey winning the 200 meters at the 2007 OSAA Class 6A championship meet. 
By midweek he had decided to hire Mark Wetmore, president of Global Athletics & Marketing. Wetmore represents numerous track athletes, including Tyson Gay. 
Friday, Wetmore was negotiating with shoe companies. It's not unusual for an initial endorsement contract for someone with Bailey's credentials to be worth around $200,000 a year. 
The Prefontaine Classic
What:The most prestigious annual one-day track and field meet in the United States and one of 14 IAAF Grand Prix meets this year. The field includes 34 medalists from the 2008 Olympics.
When, where: 10:45 a.m. Sunday (TV on KGW 8/NBC, 11 a.m.-1 p.m.), Hayward Field in Eugene
At stake: Prize money is awarded to the top eight finishers in each event, with the winner receiving $5,000. 
Tickets: Available at the Casanova Center ticket office near Autzen Stadium or by phoning 800-932-3668 (800-WEBFOOT)    
"I can't wait to get out there and show what I can do," said Bailey, who enrolled at Rend Lake College (Ill.) in January and won individual titles during the indoor and outdoor seasons. 

Already, he has turned heads, running times of 10.06 and 10.05 seconds in separate 100-meter races this spring. The 10.05, at the National Junior College Athletic Association championships May22 in Hutchinson, Kan., was reportedly run into a slight headwind. 
John Parks, who has mentored Bailey since high school and continues to advise and coach him, accompanied Bailey to New York. 
Parks said one agent told him Bailey was one of the two biggest track athletes expected to turn professional this summer, the other being Oregon senior Galen Rupp. 
Bailey had anticipated staying in school and trying to land a Division I scholarship, particularly with concerns that a weak economy might limit his chances to sign a pro deal. 
But the agents were on to Bailey all spring, and several were in Kansas to watch him in the junior college championship meet. They were wowed watching the 6-foot-4 Bailey navigate the turn in the 200 and run 20.45 seconds as if he were jogging. In a sense, he was. Bailey was trying to protect a tender hamstring and didn't accelerate until late in the race. 
Parks said he received a text message from Lance Brauman, the coach of U.S. 100 record-holder Tyson Gay and a spectator at the meet. 
"It's about to get crazy," the text said. 
Bailey is considered one of the top sprinting prospects in the U.S., with a tall build that reminds some of Jamaican Olympic champion and world-record holder Usain Bolt, who is 6-5. 
"Everybody's trying to (sign) the next great American guy," Parks said. "After watching the Olympics last summer, the thought is that the U.S. needs a tall sprinter to go after Bolt." 
Track & Field News recently ranked Bailey in the top 10 in the U.S. in the 100 and 200. Because Bailey is still considered a raw talent who hasn't been in a consistent, high-level program, he is perhaps two years from making the impact some see for him. 
Still, Parks, who coached Portland State's distance runners for the past nine months, said Bailey looked great in workouts this week. 
"He's ready to unleash a 200. I still think that's his better event," Parks said. "The stars just haven't aligned (for a fast time) yet." 
Closer to home, Bailey's girlfriend is expecting a baby in October. That has added an extra layer of stress to Bailey's situation and factored into his decision to turn professional. 
"It's not the main reason (to turn pro), but definitely part of it," Bailey said. 
Bailey doesn't have money in his pocket yet. That would come after he signs a shoe deal. But he is eager to demonstrate his worth. 
"I can't wait to get out there and run under 10 (seconds, in the 100 meters), under 20 (in the 200)," Bailey said. "It's all going to come with time. I'm not going to push anything. I'm just going to do my best."
