ABOUT US
 
Open + Connected + Catalytic


What we focus on when identifying new portfolio companies can be found under "Our Focus". As an entrepreneur, however, it’s also important for you to know what you’re looking for in a financial partner. At HealthQuest we capture our ethos in three words: “Open + Connected + Catalytic”For us, OPEN means being open to ideas and situations that other investors might just dismiss. As investors (and entrepreneurs) we’ve all had success with opportunities that were over-looked or rejected by others. We think that sometimes those are, in fact, the very best opportunities. We also like entrepreneurs that challenge our own paradigms about business and investing so we remain open-minded at all times.HealthQuest is CONNECTED throughout the industry with an exceptionally broad network of established relationships with major industry players, providers and provider groups, payers, successful entrepreneurs and other investors. These relationships become an asset to our portfolio companies as we help them build bridges to potential commercial partners and collaborators, help strengthen boards and management teams, raise future capital or (when appropriate) find acquirers for our companies.Finally, we describe ourselves as CATALYTIC because in every company we partner with we want to make a difference to the business beyond the capital invested. We look for opportunities where our experience, networks, or other contributions can fundamentally change the trajectory of the business. Every member of our team looks for catalytic opportunities with every company in our portfolio on a continuous basis – and we believe we’ve had that kind of impact on each one.Our TeamOur team has decades of investing experience and also decades of experience operating businesses of the types we invest in. We also have a Board of Advisors that we can call on to help evaluate investments and assist our portfolio companies. [Scroll down or click on photos for individual bios]

Garheng Kong, MD, PhD, MBAManaging PartnerGarheng founded HealthQuest Capital in 2013 to pursue opportunities for investing in fields and locations that he felt were overlooked by many venture and growth investors. A physician and engineer by training, Garheng has 17 years of experience investing in innovative healthcare companies with a long list of successes. He has served on the boards of HealthQuest portfolio companies Avedro, Avizia, Castle Biosciences, First Aid Shot Therapy, Health Channels, Magnolia Medical, Trice Medical, Venus, and VirMedica.  Some of his notable past successes include IPO’s with Cempra (CEMP), Alimera (ALIM), Applied Genetic Technology Corp. (AGTC), Proteon (PRTO), Histogenics (HSGX) and TransEnterix (TRXC). His investments going on to successful M&A transactions include: Calibra Medical (J&J), Cellective (AstraZeneca), Serenex (Pfizer), Athenix (Bayer), NovaMin (GSK), Aldagen (Cytomedix), Salveo Specialty Pharmacy (United Health), SARCode (Shire), and Spirox (Entellus). Each case was an opportunity where the entrepreneur was “genuine,” the commercial opportunity was clear, and the science was strong. Garheng continues to look for each of these for HealthQuest’s investments.Garheng’s interests and industry footprint are broad as he also serves on the board of LabCorp (LH), Alimera Sciences (ALIM), Histogenics (HSGX), Cempra (CEMP), StrongBridge (SBBP), the Duke University Medical Center, SEBIO, Corporate Chaplains of America and numerous industry groups.Garheng received two undergraduate degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biological Sciences from Stanford, while on an athletic scholarship. He then earned a MD, PhD and MBA from Duke University, graduating #1 in his class in each instance. His early career included stints at GlaxoSmithKline, McKinsey and a medical device start-up, TherOx, before joining Intersouth Partners and then Sofinnova Ventures. He lives in Redwood City with his physician wife (a board certified electrophysiologist) and was a nationally ranked volleyball player (and avid “foodie”).Randy ScottPartnerRandy joined Garheng in starting HealthQuest in 2013. After a successful career as a MedTech entrepreneur, Randy switched careers because he also saw the opportunities overlooked by investors and felt he could help innovative young businesses by applying the lessons he learned by leading those kinds of companies. He is currently on the board of HealthQuest portfolio companies Vestagen, Virmedica and Avizia and is a Board observer on Magnolia Medical, Trice Medical and FAST.Randy’s industry successes include starting NovaMin Technology, Inc. leading it through financing, growth and eventual acquisition by GlaxoSmithKline (at a 10x return on capital); a turn-around of USBiomaterials Corp’s bone-grafting business from perennial money-loser to a profitable spin-out (now NovaBone Products); and a member of the early management team at LensCrafters as it emerged from start-up to market leader. These businesses each solved real problems for patients and users and those are the kind of opportunities Randy seeks as he thinks about opportunities at HealthQuest. Randy is committed to supporting entrepreneurs both in HealthQuest’s portfolio and beyond, including as past chair of the Gainesville Area Innovation Network, board member of the Cade Museum of Invention and Creativity, advisory board member for the Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Public Research.Randy graduated from Georgia Tech with a BS in Management Science. He spent the first half of his career in consumer products marketing, starting in brand management at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati. Randy lives in Gainesville, Florida with his wife and three sons with whom he enjoys wilderness backpacking.Todd Creech, MBAPartnerTodd joined HealthQuest in 2016 after spending the prior nine years as a healthcare CFO, helping build several successful companies to profitable exits. He joins HealthQuest excited to bring his operations and financial experiences to innovative companies that are primed for growth with the right plan and execution.Most recently he has been the acting CFO for Femasys, a medtech company developing and selling devices targeted at women’s health issues. Prior to that, he was CFO and Treasurer of ZS Pharma (IPO in 2014 and sold to AstraZenaca in 2015; a 30x increase in valuation from when he joined in 2013).  Todd was the CFO and led business development activities for Sarcode which developed lifitigrast, the first dry-eye pharmaceutical to be approved (2016) for both signs and symptoms of dry eye (sold to Shire in 2013).  He was also the CFO of Sirion Therapeutics, an ophthalmic company that successfully developed and received approval for two products (Durezol and Virgan) and sold to Alcon and Bausch and Lomb in 2010. During his CFO tenure he has raised more than $500m in equity and debt, helping to build operations and companies that generated over $3.5b in exits.Earlier in his career, Todd did healthcare venture investing for Quintiles and worked with SRI International. He has also co-founded two companies; a spectroscopy platform spinout of Duke University (Centice) and a specialty pharmaceutical company (TLC Pharma).Todd holds bachelor's degrees in Finance and Accounting from Miami (Ohio) University where he was also a scholarship baseball player, and an MBA from Duke University. He is an Executive-in-Residence for Moffitt Cancer Center and sits on the Healthcare Advisory Board for Duke’s Fuqua School of Business. He and his wife live in Tampa, Florida with their two sons.David Kabakoff, PhDPartnerDavid shares his time between HealthQuest and Sofinnova Ventures, where he has been an investor since 2007. David joined the HealthQuest team to leverage decades of experience as an entrepreneur in the diagnostics field. While a chemist by training, the companies that David has led as President, CEO or Chairman have produced billions of dollars in returns for investors and employees. He currently serves on the Boards of portfolio companies Lineagen and Biotheranostics and is a board observer for Castle Biosciences.As an operator David’s successes include leading the development of some of the diagnostic industry’s most iconic products like the first yes/no color changing pregnancy test, the PSA test for prostate cancer and the rapid strep throat test, plus numerous cancer diagnostics. He served in senior executive positions at Hybritech, was EVP of Dura Pharmaceuticals, CEO of Spiros Development Corp., Corvas International and co-founder/CEO of Salmedix. Each of the products he developed succeeded because it made a big impact on the medical management of patients and David keeps a keen eye out for the same thing when he considers investments for HealthQuest.In addition to his HealthQuest Board responsibilities, David serves as a Board member of Antiva Biosciences and Dauntless Pharmaceuticals, and as a Board Observer at Histogenics.  He has served as Chairman of Trius Therapeutics (acquired by Cubist), Chairman of Cebix Inc., Chairman of Amplimmune, Inc. (acquired by AstraZeneca), and as a Director of InterMune, Inc. (acquired by Roche), and Allylix, Inc. (acquired by Evolva).David earned his BA in chemistry from Case Western Reserve University and then his PhD from Yale University. He lives with his wife in the San Diego area and enjoys fine wine, travel and skiing.Richard Lin, MD, MBAConsulting PartnerRich joined HealthQuest as a Consulting Partner in 2014 to leverage his 16+ years of healthcare investing experience in both venture capital and small cap public companies. Having begun his career as a physician, surgeon and scientist, Rich understands first-hand how innovative companies can uniquely impact the practice of medicine. Following his career as a surgeon and scientist, he spent 15+ years at Three Arch Partners, a healthcare focused venture capital firm, where he sourced deals, made investments and added value as a Board member. He serves as a Board member on portfolio company Inmediata.Past investments that he was involved in include Calistoga (Gilead), Visiogen (Abbot),  Cameron (Boston Scientific), Confluent (Tyco), Novacept (Cytyc), Vivant (Tyco), Calibra (J&J), inGenuity (Qiagen), Spiration (Olympus), Sirtris (GSK), Salveo (Catamaran) and ePocrates, (Athena Health).  In addition to HealthQuest, Rich invests in small cap public companies (also focused in healthcare) as the Founder and General Partner of Acuta Capital, which has over $200M in AUM. His experience in following companies through start-up phase, to IPO and beyond as public companies offers him unique perspective at how young companies can best create lasting value.Rich holds a BS from Stanford University where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa.  He received an MD from Harvard Medical School where he graduated cum laude and was named a Howard Hughes Scholar for his research efforts with the National Institute of Health.  After medical school, he then went to UCSF School of Medicine for surgical residency and then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business where he received an MBA and graduated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.  Rich and his wife reside in San Juan, PR while maintaining long-time ties to the Silicon Valley area.Thomas H. Callaway, MD, MBAVenture PartnerTom is a venture partner with HealthQuest, where he leverages his training as a physician, experience in the diagnostics industry and success as one of the industry’s best executive recruiters and management team builders. He serves as a Board observer for portfolio companies Lineagen and Inmediata.Tom founded Life Science Partner, a very successful executive recruiting firm that has helped build the leadership teams at some of the world’s foremost medical device and pharmaceutical companies, as well as many venture-backed companies in the medical device, biotech and healthcare services sectors. Prior to LSP, he led similar practices at Korn/Ferry and Russell Reynolds. Tom has learned that the quality of a company’s management team predicts it’s success more than products or technologies and that perspective guides him in looking at companies for HealthQuest.Tom began his career at Roche Molecular, where he developed and implemented their first marketing programs around PCR for medical diagnostics, including HIV detection. Like all HealthQuest partners he then worked inside a start-up, SyStemix where he established technology developmental partnerships with major cancer centers including MD Anderson, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Mayo Clinic. SyStemix developed proprietary stem cell purifying technologies important for treatment of cancer and genetic illnesses. He was the liaison with Sandoz's oncology group, whose parent company completed its acquisition of the company in 1996.Tom has been especially active at promoting the industry across his home state of Georgia and the entire southeast.

G’00, B’03, M’01, Founder and Managing Partner, HealthQuest Capital






Garheng Kong





Garheng founded HealthQuest Capital (as a Managing Partner at Sofinnova Ventures) in 2013 to pursue opportunities for investing in fields and locations that he felt were overlooked by many venture and growth investors. A physician and engineer by training, Garheng has 16 years of experience investing in innovative healthcare companies with a long list of successes. He currently serves on the boards of portfolio companies Alimera Sciences (ALIM), Castle Biosciences, Cempra (CEMP), First Aid Shot Therapy, Histogenics (HSGX), Trice Medical, and VirMedica.
Some of his notable past successes include IPO’s with Cempra (CEMP), Alimera (ALIM), Applied Genetic Technology Corp. (AGTC), Proteon (PRTO), Histogenics (HSGX) and TransEnterix (TRXC). His investments going on to successful M&A transactions include: Calibra Medical (J&J), Cellective (AstraZeneca), Serenex (Pfizer), Athenix (Bayer), NovaMin (GSK), Aldagen (Cytomedix), Salveo Specialty Pharmacy (Catamaran) and SARCode (Shire). Each case was an opportunity where the entrepreneur was “genuine,” the commercial opportunity was clear, and the science was strong. Garheng continues to look for each of these for HealthQuest’s investments.
Garheng’s interests and industry footprint are broad as he also serves on the board of Laboratory Corporation of America (“LabCorp” NYSE:LH), the Duke University Medical Center, SEBIO, Corporate Chaplains of America and numerous industry groups.
Garheng received two undergraduate degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biological Sciences from Stanford, while on an athletic scholarship. He then earned a MD, PhD and MBA from Duke University, graduating #1 in his class in each instance. His early career included stints at GlaxoSmithKline, McKinsey and a medical device start-up, TherOx, before joining Intersouth Partners. He lives in Redwood City with his physician wife (a board certified electrophysiologist) and is a nationally ranked volleyball player (and avid “foodie”).

The Company also announced today that Joseph M. Mahady, who has served as a director, has elected to step down from the Strongbridge Biopharma Board of Directors.“We are pleased to welcome Garheng to our Board of Directors during this important period of growth and evolution for Strongbridge Biopharma,” said Matthew Pauls, president, chief executive officer and member of the Board of Directors of Strongbridge Biopharma plc. “Garheng’s industry footprint, notable successes and involvement within the healthcare space will undoubtedly be of significant value to Strongbridge Biopharma,” said John H. Johnson, chairman of the Board of Directors. “Matt and the Board of Directors join me in acknowledging and thanking Joe for his dedication and contributions to the Company over the years and we wish him all the best,” Johnson added.Dr. Kong has nearly 20 years of clinical and technical experience in creating and building high-growth and innovation-based healthcare businesses. He currently serves on the Boards of Alimera Sciences, Castle Biosciences, Cempra, Duke University Medical Center, First Aid Shot Therapy, Histogenics, Laboratory Corporation of America, Trice Medical and VirMedica. He previously served on the Boards of SEBIO, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and numerous industry groups. He received two undergraduate degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biological Sciences from Stanford University and earned his M.D., Ph.D. and MBA from Duke University. Dr. Kong’s early career included positions at GlaxoSmithKline, McKinsey and TherOx, before joining Intersouth Partners.“I am pleased to join Strongbridge Biopharma’s Board of Directors and look forward to contributing my experience and helping to further the Company’s efforts to deliver promising therapeutic options for the rare disease community,” said Garheng Kong, M.D., Ph.D., MBA. About Strongbridge Biopharma Following the successful completion of its exchange offer to acquire the issued ordinary shares of Cortendo AB, Strongbridge Biopharma is now the new parent company of the Cortendo group. The group’s strategic focus is to build a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, in-licensing, acquisition and eventual commercialization of complementary product candidates across multiple franchises that target rare diseases. The group’s lead product candidate, COR-003 (levoketoconazole), is a cortisol inhibitor that is currently being studied in the global Phase 3 trial for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. COR- 003 has received orphan designation from both the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The group recently expanded its rare endocrine disease franchise with the completion of transactions for two Phase 2 product candidates: COR-004, a novel second-generation antisense compound, which is in clinical development for acromegaly and designed to block the synthesis of growth hormone receptor (GHr) thereby reducing levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the blood; and COR-005, a next-generation somatostatin analog (SSA) with a unique receptor affinity profile, being investigated for the treatment of acromegaly, with potential additional applications in Cushing’s disease and neuroendocrine tumors. The group's intent is to independently commercialize its rare endocrine assets in key global markets.Strongbridge Biopharma Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Strongbridge Biopharma that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Histogenics Closes $49 Million Series A Fundraising to Support 
      Commercial Development of Transformational Cartilage Repair Products




      --Proceeds to Drive Completion of Phase 3 NeoCart® Clinical 
      Trials and EU Regulatory Clearance of VeriCart™--
    





July 24, 2012 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regenerative medicine company Histogenics Corporation, announced today 
      the completion of a $49 million round of financing. The syndicate was 
      led by Sofinnova Ventures with participation from additional new 
      investors Split Rock Partners, BioMed Ventures and FinTech GIMV Fund, 
      L.P. Existing investors ProChon Holdings BV, Altima Partners, Foundation 
      Medical Partners, Inflection Point Capital and Boston Millennia Partners 
      also participated in the financing. Proceeds will be used to complete 
      the ongoing Phase 3 clinical program for lead product candidate NeoCart®, 
      which is currently enrolling patients. NeoCart is an autologous 
      neocartilage tissue implant that utilizes the patient’s own cells to 
      regenerate cartilage in patients suffering from cartilage lesions in the 
      knee. Funds will also support efforts to obtain regulatory clearance in 
      the European Union for product candidate VeriCart™, a single-step, 
      cell-free collagen scaffold uniquely designed to be used in conjunction 
      with the patient’s own stem cells, to repair small cartilage defects 
      frequently observed in meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament repair 
      procedures. Garheng Kong, MD, PhD of Sofinnova Ventures and Josh 
      Baltzell of Split Rock Venture Partners will join Histogenics’ Board of 
      Directors. Arnold Freedman of Boston Equity Advisors served as the 
      exclusive placement agent.
    

      Patrick O’Donnell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Histogenics, 
      commented, “We believe the quality of the investors and the significant 
      level of commitment demonstrated in this financing speak to the 
      potential of our product candidates to transform the treatment of 
      cartilage injury with the goal of returning patients to their pre-injury 
      level of activity. Each year, 1.8 million active adults and elite 
      athletes undergo arthroscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of painful 
      cartilage defects in the knee. With continued positive clinical results, 
      we believe our Phase 3 product candidate, NeoCart, has considerable 
      potential as a much-needed treatment alternative for a significant 
      portion of these patients. The successful completion of this financing 
      fully funds the Company to reach key clinical and commercial milestones 
      for NeoCart and VeriCart and allows us to focus our full attention on 
      continued successful clinical and regulatory execution.”
    

      Garheng Kong, MD, PhD, General Partner of Sofinnova Ventures added, 
      “NeoCart has the potential to dramatically change the way knee cartilage 
      injuries are treated. Current treatments for knee cartilage damage 
      frequently do not produce the lasting effects that individuals need to 
      avoid serious knee pain and improve function—preventing them from 
      getting back to their active, daily lives. Published data have shown 
      that patients treated with NeoCart experienced a very durable response 
      that is sustained throughout a period of four years or more. Sofinnova 
      is pleased to support Histogenics’ efforts to receive approval for 
      NeoCart and address this unmet clinical need.”
    

About NeoCartNeoCart® is an autologous 
      bioengineered neocartilage grown outside the body using the patient’s 
      own cells for the regeneration of cartilage lesions. NeoCart recently 
      entered a Phase 3 clinical trial after reporting positive Phase 2 data, 
      in which all primary endpoints were met, and NeoCart was found to be 
      generally well tolerated.
    

About VeriCartVeriCart™ is a single step, off-the-shelf, 
      cell-free collagen scaffold, specifically designed for cartilage 
      applications, which when reconstituted with the patients own bone marrow 
      or augmenting marrow stimulation procedures, is intended for the 
      improved repair of cartilage tissue. VeriCart is currently in 
      development.
    

About HistogenicsHistogenics is a leading regenerative 
      medicine company that combines cell therapy and tissue engineering 
      technologies to develop highly innovative products for tissue repair and 
      regeneration. In May of 2011, Histogenics acquired Israeli cell-therapy 
      company ProChon BioTech. Histogenics’ flagship products focus on the 
      treatment of active patients suffering from articular cartilage derived 
      pain and immobility. The Company takes an interdisciplinary approach to 
      engineering neocartilage that looks, acts and lasts like hyaline 
      cartilage. It is developing new treatments for sports injuries and other 
      orthopedic conditions, where demand is growing for long-term 
      alternatives to joint replacement. Histogenics has successfully 
      completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in which the NeoCart 
      autologous tissue implant’s effectiveness is compared to that of 
      standard microfracture surgery. Based in Waltham, Massachusetts, the 
      company is privately held. For more information, visit www.histogenics.com.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




sizing
Select the right size KONG for your dog to provide the safest, most-enjoyable experience.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.

KONG Solutions
KONG is a great solution for behavioral issues.
KONG Solutions help satisfy natural instincts by redirecting to a stuffed KONG toy that also entertains, with interactive play to build the bond between pet and parent by providing a healthy outlet for dogs' energy and alleviating boredom.




What is a KONG?
KONG can be used as a chew toy, stress reliever, treat puzzle and fetch toy.
Made of durable all-natural rubber, KONG is great for dogs who like to chew and acts as a diversion, relieving stress, boredom and anxiety. Stuff a KONG with treats for hours of enjoyment or play a game of fetch with KONG's unpredictable bounce.




How to Stuff a KONG
Mix, Fill, Seal and Entice! Stuffing a KONG is easy.
Many dogs are food motivated. KONG toys are perfect to stuff with food, keeping dogs mentally challenged and occupied. Stuffing loosely in the beginning is a key to success. Entice your dog by using KONG Snacks to stuff and KONG Easy Treat to seal.




Dog's Delight
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, 1/2 cup kibble, 1/4 cup green beans and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




Chicken Pot Pie
While KONG is a dog toy, another impactful use is when it is stuffed with a dog's favorite food.
Mix 1/2 cup mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup cooked chicken, 1/4 cup frozen peas and carrots together and stuff into a KONG. Freeze for a longer lasting treat.




sizing
Select the right size KONG for your dog to provide the safest, most-enjoyable experience.
