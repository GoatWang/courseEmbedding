TumorGraft ProcessOverview of the Champions TumorGraft® Process and Options
The Champions TumorGraft process begins with a piece of live tumor. It is best to plan for a personalized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) in advance of surgery/biopsy.
Implantation
A piece of the patient’s living tumor is removed during surgery or biopsy and is implanted in mice. By implanting the tumor together with its microenvironment, Champions TumorGraft® PDX tumor molds continue to very closely resemble the patient’s tumor, with 94 percent genetic correlation to the tumor in the patient. Approximately 65 percent of most tumor types implanted will grow successfully in mice.
Growth
While the tumors are growing in the mice, the patient continues to receive regular cancer treatment therapy from their oncologist. This growth period generally takes two months or longer.
Testing
Our scientists work closely with treating physicians to determine which cancer drugs to test on the patient’s PDX tumor model. Our labs will administer these cancer treatments to the mice and measure the living tumor’s response to each drug regimen. Physicians receive a robust report on the effectiveness of each tested cancer therapy on the tumor model. With this information in hand, physicians can personalize each patient’s cancer treatment therapy.
Banking
Every Champions TumorGraft PDX model is preserved as a living sample for future patient use. These banked models can be regrown and tested in the event of cancer progression or recurrence.
The entire process (implantation through testing) typically takes 4-6 months.
 Keep your patient’s tumor — and their options — alive by sending their tumor to Champions.

Therapeutic ResponseChampions TumorGraft® PDX Models Can Improve Therapeutic Response
Introducing an in vivo tumor model for predicting therapeutic efficacy. Champions TumorGraft patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent a revolutionary technology that uses the patient’s own tumor to evaluate personalized cancer therapy and treatment. A personalized PDX model is Champions Oncology’s innovative platform for implanting a piece of your patient’s live tumor directly into an immune-deficient mouse.

This revolutionary method preserves the characteristics of the tumor, with all of its different cells and supportive stroma, in a living environment, as if it were growing in  the patient. (Click here for a comparison of ChampionsTumorGraft PDX models to traditional xenografts.)
Over time, the tumor will be expanded and implanted into additional mice.
Champions will then test multiple anticancer drug regimens on these mice to identify which one(s) may be most effective at either shrinking or inhibiting the growth of your patient’s tumor.

Champions has conducted studies that have shown that a treatment that either shrinks the tumor or largely inhibits the growth of the tumor implanted into mice has a high likelihood of also working against the tumor in the patient’s body.123
Your patient benefits because these treatments are tested on a live sample of the entire tumor, rather than on the patient — so you might lessen the risk of needless side effects for treatments that might not work on them.

ExperienceExperience with Different Tumor Types
Over the last three years, Champions has engrafted over 900 individual patient tumors, and of these, approximately 70 percent grew and established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. A drug that benefited the patient, either through stabilization or regression of disease, was identified from 90 percent of these PDX models (data updated July 2015).

Finding Hope
Patients receiving treatment guided by Champions TumorGraft® testing have responded to their individualized treatments and seen a reduction in the size of their tumors, with durable remissions.
Tested Tumor Types
Tumors that have been treated successfully using Champions TumorGraft testing include cancers of the colon, pancreas, gastric, esophagus, lung and breast, as well as sarcomas and others.
Treatment Solutions Evaluated
Champions TumorGraft® PDX models can predict the likely success of many therapies, including single-agent and combination chemotherapy regimens, targeted biological drugs and antiangiogenics.
Real-World Results: Personalized Cancer Treatment by Champions TumorGraft PDX Models
Our experience and successes encompass a wide and distinct variance of tumor types and patient diagnostics. Chamipions TumorGraft technology represents a breakthrough, with an individual approach to personalized cancer treatment. Below, is an example of one of our success stories.
The Science in Action — Dean, 63, Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Treatment history:
Dean underwent extensive abdominal surgery to resect a cancer of the pancreas, but the cancer recurred 12 months after surgery. Dean was treated with the most common treatment (i.e., standard of care), the anticancer drug gemcitabine, for four months until the cancer began to grow despite treatment.
What Champions Oncology found:
Based on Champions TumorGraft testing, one of the treatments tested was mitomycin C – which is rarely used to treat pancreatic cancer. This treatment showed a significant response in the PDX model.

Targeted Treatment Results
Based on personalized Champions TumorGraft findings, Dean received three cycles of mitomycin C. His blood tumor marker (used to measure the tumor in the blood) was previously 98,000, and based on Champions TumorGraft-directed treatments, was reduced to under 100. After 22 months of treatment, Dean was treated with two additional cycles of mitomycin C and three cycles of cisplatin.
Dean’s cancer remained in remission for over five years. The average survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is approximately six to eight months.
Individual outcomes may vary.

Home / About Us



 





About UsChampions Oncology, Inc. is engaged in the development of advanced technology solutions and services to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs. The Champions TumorGraft® (CTG) platform is a novel approach based upon the implantation of primary human tumors in immune-deficient mice followed by propagation of the resulting engraftments, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models, in a manner that preserves the biological characteristics of the original human tumor. Champions believes that these PDX models closely reflect human cancer biology and that their response to drugs is more predictive of clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Champions is building its CTG platform through the procurement, development and characterization of TumorGrafts within multiple cancer types. Champions TumorGraft® PDX models are procured through agreements with a number of institutions in the U.S. and overseas, as well as through the company’s Personalized Oncology Solutions business.
Champions provides Personalized Oncology Solutions, or POS, to oncologists by establishing and administering expert tumor panels for their patients to analyze medical records and test results, to assist in understanding conventional and experimental options and to identify and arrange for testing, analysis and study of the patients’ cancer tissues, as appropriate. Additionally, the company offers personalized PDX development, drug studies and genome sequencing as part of our POS, whereby physicians can evaluate the effects of cancer drugs on their patients’ personalized PDX tumor model and understand the genetic makeup of each patient’s tumor, enabling them to better select treatment regimens that may be efficacious to the patient.
As the company expanded its number of PDX models, it began offering leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the benefits of its Champions TumorGraft® platform for oncology development programs. Champions provides Translational Oncology Solutions, or TOS, that are predictive of clinical outcomes and that might provide for a faster and less expensive path to drug approval. These services utilize Champions TumorGrafts® PDX tumor models to evaluate tumor sensitivity/resistance to various single, combination, standard and novel chemotherapy agents. TOS also includes biomarker discovery and the identification of novel drug combinations.

					Full Description



Champions Oncology, Inc., incorporated on June 4, 1985, is engaged in the development and sale of technology solutions and products to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs. The Company has two business segments: Personalized Oncology Solutions (POS) and Translational Oncology Solutions (TOS). The Company's POS business provides physicians and patients information to help guide the development of personalized treatment plans. The Company's TOS business provides services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking personalized approaches to drug development. The Company's TumorGraft Technology Platform consists of processes, physical tumors and information that it uses to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs. Each tumor from individual patients that it has preserved for future implantation in mice, along with the patient data and molecular information associated with these tumors, are referred to as TumorGrafts or Patient Derived XenoGrafts of PDX Models. The collection of TumorGrafts is referred to as the Company's TumorBank. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has approximately 800 PDX Models in its TumorBank. It implants tumors in mice to provide pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the opportunity to test oncology compounds on multiple tumors to test efficacy and simulate the results of human clinical trials.Personalized Oncology Solutions BusinessThe Company's core products, TumorGraft implants and drug panels, utilize TumorGraft technology to empirically test the response of a patient's tumor to multiple oncology drugs or drug combinations. The response of the tumors in the mice is tracked over time and analyzed to determine which drug or drug combination is providing the highest level of tumor growth inhibition in the mice. In addition to its core TumorGraft POS products, the Company offers non-core related POS products to its customers, including personalized tumor boards and gene sequencing. Personalized tumor boards are designed to provide access to oncologists with capability in particular tumor types. The Company also provides access to gene sequencing that analyzes the genetic makeup of patient's tumor for the purpose of identifying useful drugs. The Company also offers related personal oncology products to its customers.Translational Oncology Solutions BusinessThe Company's TOS business utilizes its technology platform to assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with their drug development process. The Company provides studies or license tumors for use in studies, which may predict the efficacy of experimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate the results of human clinical trials. These studies include in-vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from its TumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analyses that reveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not respond. The Company's studies can be used to determine which types of cancer, if any, may be inhibited by a drug. The studies can also be used to identify specific sub-populations, often characterized by particular genetic mutations that are sensitive or resistant to a drug or drug combination. These studies used in pre-clinical testing or during Phase I or II of a clinical trial, can help guide the clinical development path of new compounds or find new indications or combinations for compounds that are already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

No two patients, and no two cancers, are alike. Each deserves a personalized, comprehensive approach.









Your cancer isn’t like anyone else’s—and your treatment shouldn't be, either. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), our cancer experts use state-of-the-art technologies to treat cancer. At the same time, we help you manage cancer-related side effects like pain, nausea, neuropathy and fatigue, to help you maintain the strength and stamina to continue treatment and get back to life.
Learn about our integrative care model





Because our cancer experts treat only cancer, they are familiar with our patients' unique needs and trained on the wide array of treatments and therapies available. Each patient is assigned a multidisciplinary care team of doctors and clinicians who answer your questions, review your health history, and provide you and your family with clear information, so you can make informed decisions about your treatment.
Meet our team of experts 





At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), genomic medicine plays a prominent role in our commitment to delivering innovative, personalized treatments to our patients. The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) clinical trial offers an important new approach. The TAPUR study is a clinical trial that aims to improve our understanding of how commercially available anti-cancer drugs perform on a broader range of cancers, by matching the drugs to tumors with specific genomic mutations that the drugs are designed to target.

Watch this 360-degree video for an interactive tour of Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Use your mouse to click and drag around the video to take a virtual tour of the interior of one of our state-of-the-art cancer care hospitals.











Take the next step
The best way to learn more about becoming a patient at CTCA® is to contact us. We will guide you every step of the way:





Step 1: Discuss your options with an Oncology Information Specialist
Our Oncology Information Specialists are available 24 hours a day, every day of the year to listen, answer your questions, and help you decide if CTCA is right for you. Call us anytime at (888) 552-6760 or chat now.







Step 2: The insurance verification process
We'll obtain your insurance policy information and contact your insurance provider on your behalf to verify your benefits, which typically takes 24 to 48 hours. Then, we'll contact you to review the details of your insurance plan’s coverage.







Step 3: Scheduling an appointment
If your insurance plan works with CTCA and you're interested in coming to one of our hospitals for a consultation, we will schedule your initial appointment. We’ll coordinate your visit and handle all of the details for you to make the process as easy, stress-free and affordable as possible. If you are newly diagnosed and live within 100 miles of our Chicago hospital, you may be able to see a cancer specialist within as little as 24 hours.







Step 4: Preparing for your visit
We'll mail you out a personalized packet of information and an oncology nurse will call you at home to discuss your medical history and help address any questions or concerns you might have to ease your mind about what to expect in your first visit.







Step 5: Your 3-5 day evaluation
When you arrive, our doctors will review your medical records and healthy history, and perform a complete array of diagnostic tests and procedures. You'll also consult with various members of your care team. It typically takes 3-5 days to tailor a comprehensive treatment plan to your needs. With second opinions, our Tulsa and Philadelphia hospitals may be able to offer one-day evaluations.







Step 6: Starting treatment
Should you decide to treat here, your Oncology Information Specialist will become your initial go-to person to help plan all the details of your first visit.
