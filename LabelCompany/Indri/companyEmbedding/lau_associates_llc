Asset Managment - A Process Tailored to You








We believe – to paraphrase Nick Murray – that beating an index is not a financial plan. An investment portfolio in and of itself is no substitute for a carefully crafted plan. Our Private Wealth asset management process is tailored to your personal situation (time horizon, tolerance for risk, income and liquidity needs, etc.), with the objective being to craft investment portfolios that coordinate with and complement the other elements of your financial plan.
Asset Location
An area too often overlooked by investment-only advisors is the location of assets across different account types. Are your tax-inefficient asset classes, where possible, held within your tax-deferred accounts? Are you utilizing low turnover and/or tax harvesting strategies in your taxable investment accounts? Recent Federal income tax increases and new surtaxes only serve to heighten the importance of prudent asset location.
Asset Allocation
Having a well-executed plan is only the beginning. The way it responds and adapts to the ever-changing financial market and your dynamic needs is where its true value lies. We believe global, multi-asset class portfolios of stocks, bonds and alternative investments have the best potential to protect your assets and generate attractive returns while minimizing risk. Several capital market studies have shown that proper asset allocation is one of the most important influences on portfolio performance.* Emphasizing asset classes and investment vehicles that have little or no correlation over a market cycle help to increase success.
Investment Solutions
We implement diversified, institutional-quality investment strategies utilizing a combination of best-of-breed institutional asset managers, boutique investment firms and passive investments. It is our role to select the investment vehicles that best suit your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and values.




*Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower, Determinants of Portfolio Performance, The Financial Analysts Journal, July/August 1986.
Asset Allocation does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There is no guarantee that a diversified portfolio will outperform a non-diversified portfolio or that diversification among asset classes will reduce risk.

Executive Benefits: Recruit. Retain. Reward.








Appropriately structured Executive Benefit programs can help you attract new talent and retain the key employees that are the lifeblood of your business. A recent national Executive Benefit study indicated that 85% of companies surveyed reported having some type of nonqualified deferred compensation plans for key executives or managers.1 Where appropriate, such plans offer a class or classes of employees the ability to save on a potentially tax-deferred basis above and beyond the IRS defined contribution plan annual limits.
Do you have a strategy to help attract and keep highly talented and driven employees in your organization? Lau & Lau Associates Corporate Benefit Solutions can help you structure competitive Executive Benefit plans tailored to your company’s goals and objectives.
Types of Executive Benefits:


401(k) Look-Alike Plans

Lau Associates


What distinguishes Lau Associates LLC from other family office, financial planning and investment management firms?


Our clients tell us that we are different from other firms in the following ways:
We are particularly skilled at helping wealthy families and individuals navigate the financial – and personal – paths that they travel.
We emphasize and facilitate direct and effective communication between client family members and their advisors, and
The size of our firm and flat-fee compensation structure allow us to remain objective and focus on service and results as opposed to product sales and increased revenue from investment assets.  We have highly qualified, experienced staff who are available to all of our clients.


What multi-family office services does your firm offer?


Our multi-family office services include financial planning, sophisticated investment strategies, tax and estate planning, risk management, consolidated record-keeping and reporting, intergenerational planning and counseling, and family philanthropy.  In addition to these broad categories, we offer highly personalized services according to your unique needs, such as navigating health and long-term care options.  Our goal is to free you from the administrative burdens that often accompany significant wealth.

How are you compensated?


Lau Associates’ compensation comes from an annual retainer which is determined by the size and complexity of your situation.  We do not accept commissions or asset-based fees of any kind.

Do you work with clients who reside outside of the Delaware area?


Yes. While we call Delaware home, we work with clients throughout the United States and in a number of foreign countries.

Combining technical knowledge and a personal connection, we help our clients define and achieve their goals and design their legacies.


Why should I hire Lau to manage my investment portfolios?


Lau manages personalized investment portfolios tailored to each client’s specific needs, objectives and risk tolerance.  We strive to achieve competitive portfolio returns relative to benchmarks, reflecting our clients’ long term objectives while taking less risk than the overall market.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
