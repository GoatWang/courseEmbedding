J. Craig Lang, of Carnation, was born in 1938 to Richard  E. Lang and Susan A. Adams and was raised in Seattle. Craig died June 6,  2008, in Carnation, at the age of 69.  Throughout Craig's life, he was involved with automobiles, racing in the  early years and evolving into his great joy: designing, building and  driving street rods and traveling the blue highways with "Syl" and their  friends.  Craig got great enjoyment from the home that he and Syl had built in  1993, on their property in Carnation, where they hosted many parties,  rod runs and picnics. A standing joke among his friends was, whenever  Craig met someone new, "Well, I guess they'll be coming to the Christmas  Party."  Craig is survived by his wife Sylvia Lang, of Carnation; daughter Tina  Lang Turbin and her husband Alan Turbin, of Dunedin, Fla.; grandchildren  Jason, Cassidy and Miranda Turbin, of Toluca Lake, Calif.; stepdaughter  Kelly and husband Glen Danielsen, of Bothell; mother Mrs. Charles W.  Adams, of Seattle; sister Patricia and husband Jack Billhardt, of New  Canaan, Conn., and their sons Randy, Gregory and Stephen; mother-in-law  Teresa Graham, of Fall City; brother-in-law Barney Graham, of Fall City;  and many, many wonderful friends. Craig was preceded in death by his  father Richard E. Lang in 1982.

Dave MacDonald helps build Shelby King Cobra Lang Cooper CM/1/64


Dave MacDonald was a top notch mechanic and here he works with the crew to build the King Cobra CM/1/64. Olympia Brewery heir Craig Lang (L) funded the effort and even turned a wrench now and then during construction. Shelby purchased the chassis and shell from British car maker Cooper and the crew put the car together, including a new Ford 289 engine. The car would be tagged the Shelby King Cobra-Lang Cooper and run under the Shelby American banner. Dave MacDonald would be the Lang's sole driver. Dave is second from right. Photo Dave Friedman

The finished product! This is how the just completed King Cobra Lang-Cooper looked for its debut race at Phoenix InternationalRaceway in April 1964. In this race Dave beat out Skip Hudson, Bobby Unser, Chuck Parsons, Ken Miles, Lothar Motschenbacher,George Folmer, Jerry Titus, Ed Leslie & many others to score the Lang Cooper's first-ever victory.

CM/1/64 was painted orange and Dave MacDonald ran it twice more - at Riverside Raceway (below) on April 26, 1964 where he had more than a half lap lead on the field when the transmission locked up. Photo Dave Friedman


And then 2 weeks later (May 3, 1964) Dave MacDonald ran CM/1/64 at Laguna Seca and after a wild race long battle with Jim Hall and his mighty Chaparral Dave finished 19 seconds behind Jim and in 2nd place. Photo Dave Friedman

Unfortunately this is how the King Cobra Lang Cooper looked a week later at the May 10, 1964 USRRC Championships at KentWashington. Dave MacDonald was scheduled to drive the car at Kent but was also flying back and forth to Indy qualifying MickeyThompson's low slung racer for the 500. Shelby had Holbert out performing tire tests on the Lang when he lost it on the rain soakedcourse. With the Lang now totaled, Carroll had Dave step into Bob's King Cobra and Dave won the Kent race, outdueling Jim Halland Hap Sharp in Chaparrals. This would be Dave's last race - and win - before the fateful '64 Indy 500.

Carroll promised Craig he'd replace the car but when he called Cooper they said they only had a chassis available. Carroll took it and Cooper air freighted it to LA. Carroll then had the uber-talented Peter Brock design a new shell for the car. Uber-talented Peter Brock then used a combination of two designs he was already working on to come up with a shell for the new Lang and Don Edmunds and his guys then hammered out the aluminum and brought it to life. Well on it's way


The new Lang Copper II was on schedule to be completed for Dave MacDonald's return from Indianapolis, and ready to run in the June 6th Players 200 in Canada. But when Dave was killed at Indy work on the new Lang all but stopped. It was ultimately finished in time for the '64 LA Times Grand Prix on  Oct 11th. This photos was shortly after completion. Edmunds, Lang, Brock. [Craig Lang]

With Dave MacDonald gone Carroll Shelby selected talented driver Ed Leslie to run the new car in the Times GP. Leslie ran a strong race and finished 4th against a field of world class cars and drivers. (Dave was reining LA Times GP champion). [Dave Friedman]

Looking for additional power the team installed a Chevrolet engine and Ford man Ed Leslie opted out of the car. Craig took Carroll's advice and hired Charlie Hayes as the Lang's new driver. Craig Lang, Wally Peat and Charlie at Riverside in May '65 [William Hewitt]

Craig Lang eventually sold the Lang Cooper II (minus engine/trans) to racer Skip Scott who ran it for a spell under the Essex Wire banner.

This is how the Lang Cooper II looks today (2008). Current owner Claude Nahum hired none other than Peter Brock to do a thorough restoration and the King Cobra Lang Cooper II  looks as stunning today as it did in the sixties! Photo courtesy Peter & Gayle Brock and Vintage MotorSport
