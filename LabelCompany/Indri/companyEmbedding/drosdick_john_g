      ■ At Tosco and Ultramar, John G. Drosdick built a reputation for
      reforming corporate culture as well as for cutting costs; at Sunoco he
      demonstrated an ability to rebuild a company. His employees responded well
      to his straightforward directions, and he had a knack for making his goals
      plain to his managers. Although he made tough decisions as a leader,
      Drosdick had a sense of humor and a relaxed manner that translated not
      only into his flashy suits but into a cheerful corporate atmosphere.
    

      BUILDING A CAREER
    

      Drosdick earned a bachelor's degree from Villanova University in
      1965 and a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts at
      Amherst in 1968, both in chemical engineering. In 1968 he was hired by
      Exxon USA and moved to Houston, Texas; in 1976 he moved to Baton Rouge to
      manage Exxon's department of facilities development; and in 1981 he
      became manager of Exxon's refinery operations. Tosco Corporation
      hired Drosdick away in 1983 in order to obtain his help with their failing
      refinery business, making him vice president of that division; he moved to
      Santa Monica, California. As corporate executive vice president in 1986 he
      helped restructure Tosco's debt: the company sold $150 million in
      bonds and issued $250 million in preferred stock to pay off loans from 19
      banks. While president and chief operating officer of Tosco, Drosdick
      engineered the sales of three of the company's four refineries,
      keeping one in California, where he cut costs and improved production.
    

      When he moved to Ultramar in Long Beach, California, Drosdick took over
      the operations of another petroleum company in decline. There he cut costs
      and set up a merger with Diamond Shamrock, creating Ultramar Diamond
      Shamrock Corporation; the merger occurred soon after he left to join Sun
      Company, another petroleum company that had endured tough times in the
      1990s.
    

      RESTRUCTURING SUN COMPANY INTO SUNOCO
    

      In November 1996 Drosdick became the first person from outside Sun Company
      to be named president. Corporate headquarters lay in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, and he moved to Bryn Mawr. The CEO Robert H. Campbell had
      already begun restructuring Sun Company through the selling of its
      international operations, and as president Drosdick oversaw the final
      stages of reorganization. His day-to-day presence was quickly felt among
      coworkers in Philadelphia, where he created a notably upbeat atmosphere.
      He remarked in the 
      
        Philadelphia Business Journal
      
      , "I don't think you can be too clear with people"
      (May 2, 1997), as he made sure his managers knew exactly what was expected
      of them.
    

      In 1997 Sun Company's net income rose $270 million, and Drosdick
      was paid $560,000 in salary; he was promised bonuses of up 90 percent of
      his base salary if the company continued
       to improve. On November 6, 1998, Sun Company became Sunoco, a name
      intended to signify happier times at the company, but 1999 proved to be a
      very tough year. Gasoline prices went into a slump, and Drosdick was
      forced to oversee layoffs of refinery employees. Still, he earned a
      $73,200 bonus on top of his year's salary of $610,012.
    

      MAKING SUNOCO A STAR
    

      On May 4, 2000, while remaining president, Drosdick became CEO and
      chairman of the board at Sunoco, replacing Campbell. His vision was to
      make the company resistant to the up-and-down cycles of the petroleum
      industry. In 2000 Sunoco's biggest move was the acquisition of one
      hundred gas stations owned by Coastal Mart in the eastern United States.
      The stations and their convenience stores were renamed Sunoco and APlus.
      That year Sunoco netted $438 million.
    

      In January 2001 Sunoco purchased Aristech Chemical Corporation of
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from Mitsubishi Corporation for $674 million.
      The purchase included a research center and five chemical plants, with
      totals of 1,100 employees, and gave Sunoco the capacity to produce nine
      billion pounds of petrochemicals. Further, the deal was expected to give
      Sunoco economic "balance," as Drosdick explained, because
      chemical-sales cycles tended to oppose gasoline-sales cycles; chemical
      sales would cushion Sunoco during periods of poor gasoline sales.
      Unfortunately, for the first nine months of 2001 Sunoco's chemical
      business lost $21 million—$9 million by Aristech—on sales of
      $1.1 billion. Still, Drosdick had bought Aristech from the cash-strapped
      Mitsubishi for only half of its worth, and the purchase was intended to be
      a long-term investment.
    

      In 2001 Sunoco dropped its Kendall lubricant line and shut down its
      Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, refinery and three related lubricant plants in
      California, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. Drosdick searched for buyers for
      the facilities without success. At the end of 2001 Sunoco possessed 3,900
      gas-station and convenience-store outlets and 35 terminals for
      petroleum-products storage. The company netted $390 million for the year.
    

      In June 2003 Sunoco purchased 193 gas stations and convenience stores in
      Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina from Speedway
      SuperAmerica—a subsidiary of Marathon Ashland Petroleum—for
      $140 million. By the end of the year Sunoco owned over 4,300 retail sites,
      and the convenience stores were helping keep the bottom line steady. The
      company bought the Eagle Point refinery from El Paso for $130
      million—the price was considered low because few companies were
      interested in buying the plant. Sunoco's refining capacity grew to
      730,000 barrels per day; it began the year as America's
      ninth-largest petroleum company and finished as the eighth–largest.
    

      During this period, as Sunoco had come under fire from environmentalists
      as well as Congress for polluting the air at its manufacturing plants, the
      company undertook the installation of new pollutant-capture technology at
      its facilities. The most dramatic environmental effort came in 2004, when
      Sunoco built a new manufacturing plant for the solid fuel coke, used in
      making high-grade metals, in Haverill, Ohio, for $140 million. The plant
      included a special heat-recovery system that would produce steam to be
      piped to a Sunoco chemical plant, thus reducing pollution as well as
      recycling recovered energy. That year Sunoco's retail empire grew
      to 4,600 sites.
