This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Key Energy Services Announces Promotion of J. Marshall Dodson to Chief Financial Officer

Mar 26, 2013, 09:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Key Energy Services, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, March 26, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Key Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE:   KEG) announced that effective March 25, 2013, John Marshall Dodson has been promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Dodson joined the Company in 2005 as Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer and served in that capacity until his appointment as Vice President and Treasurer in 2009.   
The Company also announced that T.M. "Trey" Whichard, III has retired from the Company as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as of March 25, 2013. Mr. Whichard will remain available until June 24, 2013 to provide transitional support.
Dick Alario, Key's Chairman, CEO and President, commented, "Marshall Dodson has been instrumental in Key's success, first in building our accounting staff and instituting processes and controls over our financial reporting when he arrived at Key in 2005. Marshall has, since then, led our treasury, business analytics and risk management functions and has been the senior officer overseeing our banking relationships and our access to capital markets. He knows Key's operations well and has the experience and skills to move seamlessly into the senior executive position in our finance organization. I look forward to continuing to work closely with him and to rely upon his guidance and leadership as a member of Key's executive management team.
"I also want to thank Trey Whichard for his years of service as our CFO and wish him well. His expertise and impact were beneficial to Key's shareholders. Trey recruited outstanding talent in accounting, tax, risk management, credit and collections and our improved results in these areas, both domestically and internationally, are proof of the quality of the functional leaders and teams that reported to him."

Key Energy Services Announces Promotion of J. Marshall Dodson to Chief Financial Officer

  Print Page
March 26, 2013




HOUSTON, March 26, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Key Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE: KEG) announced that effective March 25, 2013, John Marshall Dodson has been promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Dodson joined the Company in 2005 as Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer and served in that capacity until his appointment as Vice President and Treasurer in 2009.   
The Company also announced that T.M. "Trey" Whichard, III has retired from the Company as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as of March 25, 2013. Mr. Whichard will remain available until June 24, 2013 to provide transitional support.
Dick Alario, Key's Chairman, CEO and President, commented, "Marshall Dodson has been instrumental in Key's success, first in building our accounting staff and instituting processes and controls over our financial reporting when he arrived at Key in 2005. Marshall has, since then, led our treasury, business analytics and risk management functions and has been the senior officer overseeing our banking relationships and our access to capital markets. He knows Key's operations well and has the experience and skills to move seamlessly into the senior executive position in our finance organization. I look forward to continuing to work closely with him and to rely upon his guidance and leadership as a member of Key's executive management team.
"I also want to thank Trey Whichard for his years of service as our CFO and wish him well. His expertise and impact were beneficial to Key's shareholders. Trey recruited outstanding talent in accounting, tax, risk management, credit and collections and our improved results in these areas, both domestically and internationally, are proof of the quality of the functional leaders and teams that reported to him."
