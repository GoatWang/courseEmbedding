Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Baldwin Investment Management
The focus of our advice is the management of your assets. We believe that investment portfolio assets should be consolidated, managed, and monitored in order to maximize the benefits of volume pricing opportunities and unification of purpose.
Using state-of-the-art technology, coupled with years of investment management experience, we follow a philosophy of investing in U.S. and foreign based companies whose market capitalization generally exceeds $2.5 billion. They are industry leaders with superb and proven management teams, who provide innovative and cutting-edge products and research, and whose earnings growth is in excess of their industry peers. We utilize Fundamental, Quantitative and Technical Analysis to isolate those companies who best fit our objectives.
For clients who desire exposure to alternative investments, Baldwin has had many years of experience in venture capital, real estate development and the utilization of various insurance products. Alternative investments have played an important role for certain client wealth management strategies.
Portfolios are individually structured to meet the growth and income needs of each client. We are mindful of the importance of asset allocation and that tax efficient investing provides enhanced long-term rewards.

Stock Selection – Baldwin Management LLC

















































































 









100 Four Falls Corp Center - Suite 202








West Conshohocken Pennsylvania








610-260-1555














 



















At Baldwin, we believe that a comprehensive stock selection process, employing quantitative, qualitative and technical methodologies, creates superior investment performance over the long term.
Recognizing that an appropriate asset allocation plan significantly influences investment performance, we initially meet with our clients to understand their risk sensitivity, as well as their current and future goals and circumstances. We then structure an asset allocation plan that fulfills our clients’ needs and desires. While cash and high-quality bonds are included in most asset allocation strategies, we believe that stocks will outperform fixed income investments over the long run.
Our stock selection process combines the best of three methodologies: our proprietary quantitative stock selection model, our qualitative stock research database and our technical chart guidance.
Baldwin’s proprietary quantitative stock selection model identifies global companies that exhibit superior price and earnings growth patterns, with a lesser but significant focus on price- earnings and price-to-sales attributes. We begin with a universe of over 800 stocks, applying our formula to each in order to assign decile rankings. The stocks favored in the rankings have performed extremely well to date.
“our stock selection process combines the best of three methodologies”
From the stock universe, we select and maintain the Baldwin Working List which includes approximately 150 stocks. Consistently high rankings and appropriate sector representation are two key criteria in the compilation and maintenance of the Baldwin Working List. Our portfolio managers meet frequently to discuss the relative growth potential of each stock sector. Larger stock positions or a greater number of stocks are purchased within sectors with strong growth prospects, while smaller positions or fewer stocks are chosen within less favored sectors.
In addition, we maintain a comprehensive stock research database. Each portfolio manager focuses on one or more equity sectors, such as Technology or Health Care, taking responsibility for understanding the companies and their stories. Their qualitative opinions, culled from a wide diversity of Wall Street and independent sources, are regularly added to the stock research database and support Working and Select list decisions.
Our technical approach consists of reviewing a variety of technical price charts for companies within our stock universe. These charts may serve as early warning indicators for companies poised to out- or under- perform the market. We also recognize that these images can assist us in our timing of stock purchases and sales and further enhance investment performance.

We are a boutique firm, serving your unique needs. As a small firm we are able to keep our costs low so that we can profitably serve a small number of high net worth individuals/families. We will remain a small, boutique firm so we can deliver customized financial/investments solutions to a select number of clients.

Company Description


Baldwin Investment Management invests in US and foreign based companies with market-caps greater than $2.5 billion. They look for industry leaders with proven management teams, who provide innovative products and research and whose earnings growth is in excess of their industry peers. The firm employs fundamental, quantitative and technical analysis in the selection process. They also offer alternative investments in venture capital, real estate development and through various insurance products.Baldwin's proprietary quantitative stock selection model identifies global companies that exhibit superior price and earnings growth patterns, with a lesser but significant focus on price- earnings and price-to-sales attributes. They begin with a universe of over 800 stocks, applying their formula to each in order to assign decile rankings. From the stock universe, they select and maintain a working list of about 150 stocks. Baldwin looks for stocks with consistently high rankings and appropriate sector representation.  Portfolio managers meet frequently to discuss the relative growth potential of each stock sector. Larger stock positions or a greater number of stocks are purchased within sectors with strong growth prospects, while smaller positions or fewer stocks are chosen within less favored sectors.Baldwin also maintains a comprehensive stock research database. Each portfolio manager focuses on one or more equity sectors. Their qualitative opinions, culled from a wide diversity of Wall Street and independent sources, are regularly added to the stock research database.The firm's technical approach consists of reviewing a variety of technical price charts for companies within their stock universe. These charts may serve as early warning indicators for companies poised to out- or under- perform the market. They use this information to assist in their timing of stock purchases and sales and to further enhance investment performance.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
