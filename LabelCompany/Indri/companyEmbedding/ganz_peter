GANZ Corporate Profile




We deliver some of the best gifts in the world - giftware, fashion accessories, top-trending décor, baby fashion and huggable plush, garden, holiday and finishing touches for the home. Kissing Krystals and Crystal Expressions are some of the lines that make up our extensive family of products.
Established by Samuel Ganz and sons Jack and Sam in 1950,  this privately-held family company is now headed by the founder's grandson,  Howard Ganz. Corporate headquarters are located in Woodbridge, ON, Canada.
In the year 2000, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. GANZ  began selling plush products, and built on this success to include a wide range  of gift offerings, collectibles, seasonal gifts and home decor products.  Webkinz World and Webkinz Jr. have bridged the virtual world by combining plush  pets with interactive play.
GANZ has established a large dedicated sales force  throughout the United States and Canada and owes its prosperity not only to  effective distribution but also to product of the highest quality.




Distribution
The primary distribution channels are gift, specialty, and  department stores throughout the United States and Canada. We currently service  approximately 30,000 retail customers, and our list is growing!
A sophisticated ordering/fulfillment system is supplemented  by a fully computerized Customer Service Department. Products are sourced from  around the world and shipped to Toronto for North American distribution.
Quality Control
The company's quality control is considered to be among the best.
Here's why: as part of the development process, we have a  staff of product managers who monitor product development directly from the  GANZ Far East Operations Headquarters in Hong Kong, with support offices in  China. The highest standards of safety, material selection, design consistency,  and packaging are met before a GANZ product is shipped from the factory.
Sales
GANZ ensures the sales staff participates in a thorough  training program and learning continues to be supported by the field management  team. On a daily basis, the sales staff is notified of available inventory,  customer activity, new business initiatives, and promotions.
We run a fully staffed Sales Liaison Department to support  the sales staff in the field. Our state-of-the-art Marketing Department  provides complete production support.

This handy cast-iron Dutch oven is a must-have for every home chef. ​ Searching for fresh meal ideas? Discover great Food Network recipes here. WHY WE Love IT Pretty enough to go from oven to table; perfect for stews, chilis and braises. Cast-iron core retains heat and cooks evenly. Oven-safe up to 500F. Basting spikes in the lid control moisture, keeping food juicy. Product Care Oven-safe to 500F Hand wash 5.5-qt. capacity What THE Pros Know Dutch ovens are perfect for braising — cooking at low temperature partially submerged in gently simmering liquid. Braising makes tough (and inexpensive) cuts of meat tender, and gives you a great sauce, too. Size: 5 1/2 Qt. Color: Blue. Gender: Unisex. Age Group: Adult. Material: Castiron.
