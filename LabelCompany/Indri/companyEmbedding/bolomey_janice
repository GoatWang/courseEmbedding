Family Promise to host 'A Taste of Hunterdon' at The Grand Colonial, Nov. 13

..... It has sponsored many events for the agency, including a title sponsorship for the annual Box City event in June. But more than simply sponsoring Box City, Unity Bank really showed its commitment and dedication to Family Promise as several staff members, including president James Hughes, vice president of marketing Rosemary Fellner, and, this year, chief administrative officer Janice Bolomey, all became citizens and slept in a box overnight. The board and staff of Family Promise of Hunterdon are grateful for not only the financial commitment that Unity Bank has made but also for the dedication that bank officials have shown to raising awareness about the issue of homelessness and homeless prevention in the community.

CLINTON (October 17, 2013) - Unity Bank Senior Vice
  President/Director of Sales Janice Bolomey of Union Township has
  been selected as a New Leader in Banking by the New Jersey Bankers Association
  (NJBankers). Bolomey is one of only 12 bankers under age 50
  statewide selected for the prestigious honor from NJBankers, a
  trade association representing more than 350 banks and service
  providers.


  Bolomey manages Unity's 15 branch network and its Human Resources
  and Mortgage departments as well as the bank's sales program. She
  came to Unity in 2000 and has also held the positions of Regional
  Manager & Security Officer, Branch Administrator and Director
  of Sales. Bolomey previously worked with First Union Bank, which
  is now Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. Bolomey has worked her
  way up through the ranks in the banking industry, holding
  positions from teller on up to executive management.


  "Janice has made an indelible impact on Unity Bank since she
  joined our team 13 years ago and I am very proud to call her my
  colleague," said Unity Bank President & CEO James A. Hughes.
  "Her big picture vision of who we are as a bank can be seen
  throughout the organization from overall philosophy to the
  creation of our sales plan. Janice's leadership has helped
  develop and enable our vision of being an active corporate
  citizen and, at the same time, resulted in dramatic sales growth
  in Unity Bank products and services to the business community."


  Bolomey will be honored during the Future Leaders in Banking Gala
  to be held November 19, in conjunction with its annual trade
  show, BankHorizons, at Resorts Hotel & Casino in Atlantic
  City. "This program recognizes the upcoming stars of the banking
  industry," according to NJBankers. A small panel of judges, none
  of whom are active bankers or NJBankers employees, selected the
  honorees. For program information, please visit www.njbankers.com.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
