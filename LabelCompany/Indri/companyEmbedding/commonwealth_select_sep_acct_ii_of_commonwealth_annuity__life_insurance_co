 SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS

This Summary is intended to provide only a very brief overview of the more      
significant aspects of the Policy. The remainder of this Prospectus offers a    
more complete presentation of the topics presented here, and will help you      
better understand the product. However, the Policy, together with its attached  
application, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company.      

The Policy is a life insurance contract with death benefits, Policy Value, and  
other features traditionally associated with life insurance. The Policy is      
"variable" because the Policy Value will increase or decrease depending on the  
investment experience of the Sub-Accounts of the Variable Account. Under some   
circumstances, the Death Benefit may vary with the investment experience of the 
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

Unlike traditional insurance policies, the Policy has no fixed schedule for     
payments. Within limits, you may make payments of any amount and frequency.     
While you may establish a schedule of payments ("planned payments"), the Policy 
will not necessarily lapse if you fail to make planned payments, and making     
planned payments will not guarantee that the Policy will remain in force.       

WHAT ARE THE POLICY'S BENEFITS?                                                 

While the Policy is in force, it will provide:                                  

-    Life insurance coverage on the named Insured                     
-    Policy Value                                                     
-    Surrender rights and partial withdrawal rights                   
-    Loan privileges                                                  

Other optional benefits available through the policy include:                   

    -    Waiver of Premium Rider - This Rider provides that, during periods of
       total disability continuing more than four months, the Company will
       add to the Policy Value each month an amount selected by you or the
       amount needed to pay the Policy charges, whichever is greater. This
   value will be used to keep the Policy in force. This benefit is
         subject to the Company's maximum issue benefits. Its cost will change
yearly.                                                     

   -    Guaranteed Insurability Rider - This rider guarantees that insurance
          may be added at various option dates without Evidence of Insurability.
         This benefit may be exercised on the option dates even if the Insured
is disabled.                                                

  -    Other Insured Rider -- This Rider provides a term insurance benefit
          for up to five Insureds. At present this benefit is only available for
        the spouse and children of the primary Insured. The Rider includes a
        feature that allows the "Other Insured" to convert the coverage to a
flexible premium adjustable life insurance Policy.          

  -    Exchange Option Rider -- This Rider allows you to use the Policy to
insure a different person, subject to Company guidelines.   

  -    Living Benefits Rider -- This Rider permits part of the proceeds of
  the Policy to be available before death if the Insured becomes
terminally ill or is permanently confined to a nursing home.

    -    Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider -- This Rider, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ONLY
   AT DATE OF ISSUE, (a) guarantees that the Policy will not lapse
  regardless of the performance of the Variable Account, and (b)
provides a guaranteed net death benefit.                    

WHAT ARE THE POLICY'S RISKS?                                                    

There are certain risks associated with the Policy:                             

 -    There is no guaranteed minimum Policy Value. The value of a Policy
will vary up or down to reflect the                         

P-->485APOS6th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
          investment experience of allocations to the Sub-Accounts and the fixed
       rates of interest earned by allocations to the General Account. The
       Policy Value will also be adjusted for other factors, including the
        amount of charges imposed. The Policy will terminate if Policy Value
       is insufficient to cover certain monthly charges plus loan interest
 accrued, or if Outstanding Loans exceed the Policy Value less
surrender charges.                                          

     -    The Policy Value may decrease to the point where the Policy will lapse
   and provide no further death benefit without additional premium
        payments, unless the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit is in effect.
    The Guaranteed Death Benefit may not be available in all states.

    -    Taking a loan from your Policy may increase the risk that your Policy
      will lapse, will have a permanent effect on your Policy Value, and
   will reduce the Death Benefit. In addition, if your Policy is a
          modified endowment contract for tax purposes, taking a Policy loan may
have tax consequences.                                      

-    Surrender of the Policy may be subject to a substantial surrender
         charge. Partial Withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and a
Partial Withdrawal Charge.                                  

  -    A Policy may be considered a "modified endowment contract" if total
          payments during the first seven Policy years (or within seven years of
        a material change in the Policy) exceed the total net level payments
     payable, if the Policy had provided paid-up future benefits after
       seven level annual payments. If the Policy is considered a modified
          endowment contract, all distributions (including Policy loans, partial
withdrawals, surrenders and assignments) will be taxed on an
          "income-first" basis. In addition, a 10% additional penalty tax may be
        imposed on that part of a distribution that is includible in income.

  -    Each Fund is subject to investment risks and other risks. We do not
         promise that the Funds will meet their investment objectives. Amounts
         that you have allocated to Sub-Accounts may grow in value, decline in
    value, or grow less than you expect, depending on the investment
          performance of the Funds in which those Sub-Accounts invest. Your bear
     the investment risk that those Funds possibly will not meet their
  investment objectives. A description of each Fund's investment
         policies and a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each Fund may
by found in the Fund's prospectus.

* This charge applies only on a full surrender or decrease in face amount within
ten years of the date of issue or of an increase in face amount. The maximum    
surrender charge has two parts: (1) a deferred administrative charge of $8.50   
per thousands dollars of the initial face amount or increase; and (2) a deferred
sales charge of 28.5% of payments received or associated with the increase up to
the guideline annual premium for the increase. The maximum surrender charge is  
level for the first 24 Policy months, then reduces by 1/96ath per moth, reaching
zero after 10 Policy years.                                                     

The surrender charge shown in the table may not be representative of the charge 
you would pay. For more information about the surrender charge that would apply 
to your Policy, please contact us at the address or telephone number shown on   
the front cover of this Prospectus or contact your financial representative.    

** The Company will reduce the amount of the Policy's outstanding Surrender     
Charge by the amount of the Partial Withdrawal Charge. If no Surrender Charges  
apply to the Policy at the time of a withdrawal, no partial withdrawal charge   
will apply to that withdrawal.

 THE COMPANY, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT AND THE FUNDS
WHAT IS THE COMPANY?                                                            

Unless otherwise specified, any reference to the "Company" refers exclusively to

Allmerica Financial and First Allmerica are subject to the laws of the          
Commonwealth of Massachusetts governing insurance companies and to regulation by
the Commissioner of Insurance of Massachusetts. In addition, the are subject to 
the insurance laws and regulations of other states and jurisdictions in which   
they are licensed to operate.                                                   

WHAT IS THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT?                                                   

In this prospectus, "Variable Account" collectively refers to the Allmerica     
Select Separate Account II of Allmerica Financial and the Allmerica Select      
Separate Account II of First Allmerica. The Variable Account is a separate      
investment account compromised of sub-accounts. Each sub-account invests in a   
corresponding investment portfolio ("Fund") of a management investment company. 
The assets used to fund the variable portion of the Policy are set aside in the 
Variable Account, and are kept separate from the general assets of the Company. 
Under Massachusetts law, assets equal to the reserves and other liabilities of  
the Variable Account may not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any 
other business of the Company. Each Sub-Account is administered and accounted   
for as part of the general business of the Company, but the income, capital     
gains, or capital losses of each Sub-Account are allocated to such Sub-Account, 
without regard to other income, capital gains or capital losses of the Company, 
or the other Sub-Accounts.                                                      

The Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to   
change the names of the Variable Account and the sub-accounts. The Company may  
also offer other variable life insurance policies investing in the Variable     
Account , which are not discussed in this Prospectus. In addition the Variable  
Account may invest in other underlying funds that are not available to the      
Policies described in this prospectus.                                          

WHAT ARE THE FUNDS?                                                             

Each sub-account invests in a corresponding investment portfolio ("Fund") of an 
open-end management investment company. The Funds available through this policy 
are NOT publicly traded. They are only available as variable investment options 
in variable life insurance policies or variable annuity contracts issued by life
insurance companies or, in some cases, through participation in certain         
qualified pension or retirement plans. The investment advisers of the Funds may 
manage publicly traded mutual funds with similar names and objectives. However, 
the Funds are NOT directly related to any publicly traded mutual fund.          
Consequently, the investment performance of the Furnds and any similarly named  
publicly traded mutual fund may differ substantially.                           

A summary of investment objectives of each of the Funds is set forth below.     
Certain Funds have similar investment objectives and/or policies. Therefore, to 
choose the Sub-Accounts which best meet your needs and objectives, carefully    
read the prospectuses of the Funds, along with this Prospectus. There can be no 
assurance that the investment objectives of the Funds can be achieved. In some  
states, insurance regulations may restrict the availability of particular Funds.

THE POLICY
The Company is not currently issuing new Policies. As of the date of this       
Prospectus, the Company has effectively ceased issuing new policies, except     
in connection with certain pre-exisitng contractual plans and programs. This    
Prospectus provides only a very brief overview of the more significant          
aspects of the Policy and of the Company's administrative procedures, for the   
benefit of the Company's current Policyowners. The Policy together with its     
attached application constitutes the entire agreement between you and the       
Company.                                                                        

HOW DO I COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPANY?                                          

You may contacting us at the address or telephone number shown on the back cover
of this Prospectus or by contacting your financial representative.              

EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSACTIONS                                                  

Once your Policy is in force, the effective date of payments, forms and requests
you send is usually determined by the day and time we receive the item in good  
order at the mailing address that appears in this Prospectus. "Good order" means
that we have received all information, letters, forms or other documents,       
completed to our satisfaction, which we believe are necessary to process the    
transaction. Premium payments, loan requests, transfer requests, loan payments  
or withdrawal or surrender requests that we receive in good order before the    
close of business (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, or the close of the New York 
Stock Exchange, if earlier) on a business day will normally be effective as of  
the end of that day, unless the transaction is scheduled to occur on another    
business day. If we receive your payment or request after the close of business 
on a business day, your payment or request will be effective as of the end of   
the next business day. If a scheduled transaction falls on a day that is not a  
business day, we'll process it as of the end of the next business day.          

Other forms, notices and requests are normally effective on the day that we     
receive them in good order, unless the transaction is scheduled to occur on     
another business day. Assignments, change of owner and change of beneficiary    
forms are effective as of the day you sign the assignment or form, once we      
receive them in good order.                                                     

WRITTEN REQUESTS 

Whenever this Prospectus refers to a communication as a "written request," it   
means in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to us, and      
received at the mailing address indicated on the front cover of this Prospectus.
We will process the transaction when the written request is received in good    
order. For some transactions, including assignments and surrender of the Policy,
we require you to use Company-approved forms. You may obtain Company-approved   
forms by calling 800-366-1492.                                                  

TELEPHONE REQUESTS                                                              

You have the privilege to make telephone requests. The Company and our agents   
and affiliates will not be responsible for losses resulting from acting upon    
telephone requests reasonably believed to be genuine. We will employ reasonable 
procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone are genuine;  
otherwise, we may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent    
instructions. Such procedures may include, among others things, requiring some  
form of personal identification prior to acting upon instructions received by   
telephone. All transfer instructions by telephone are tape recorded.            

We cannot guarantee that you will always be able to reach us to complete a      
telephone transaction. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the        
privilege to make requests by telephone at any time without prior notice. Under 
these circumstances, you should submit your request in writing or other form    
acceptable to us.                                                               

HOW DO I APPLY FOR A POLICY?                                                    
The Company is not currently issuing new Policies. The following describes the  
Company's procedures previously used in issuing the Policies.                   

Upon receipt at its Principal Office of a completed application from a          
prospective Policyowner, the Company follows certain insurance underwriting     
procedures designed to determine whether the proposed Insured is insurable. This
process may involve medical examinations, and may require that further          
information be provided by the proposed Policyowner before a determination of   
insurability can be made. The Company reserves the right to reject an           
application                                                                     

P-->485APOS18th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
which does not meet its underwriting guidelines, but in underwriting insurance, 
the Company complies with all applicable federal and state prohibitions         
concerning unfair discrimination.                                               

It is possible to obtain life insurance protection during the underwriting      
process through a Conditional Insurance Agreement. If at the time of application
a payment is made that is equal to at least one minimum monthly payment for the 
Policy as applied for (up to a maximum of $500,000), the Company provides       
conditional insurance, subject to the terms of the Conditional Insurance        
Agreement. This coverage generally continues for a maximum of 90 days from the  
date of the application or the completion of a medical exam, should one have    
been required. In no event are any insurance proceeds be paid under the         
Conditional Insurance Agreement if death is by suicide.                         

If payments are made before the date of issue and acceptance, we allocate the   
payments to the AIT Money Market Fund within two business days of receipt of the
payments at our principal office. If the Policy is not issued and accepted, we  
return the GREATER of:                                                          

-    The payments OR                                                  

    -    The value of the amount allocated to the AIT Money Market Fund, which
     will be net of mortality and expense risk charges, administrative
charges and fund expenses.                                  

If the application or enrollment form is approved and the Policy is issued and  
accepted, we allocate the Policy Value on issuance and acceptance according to  
your instructions. However, if the Policy provides for a full refund of payments
under its "Right to Examine Policy" provision as required in your state, we     
initially allocate the Sub-Account investments to the AIT Money Market Fund.    
This allocation to the AIT Money Market Fund is for for:                        

  -    14 days from issuance and acceptance, except as described below, or

   -    24 days from issuance and acceptance for replacements in states with
an extended right to examine, or                            

  -    34 days from issuance and acceptance for California citizens age 60
and older, who have an extended right to examine, or        

  -    60 days from issuance and acceptance if the Policy was purchased in
New York as a replacement for an existing Policy            

After this, we allocate all amounts according to your investment choices.       

CAN I EXAMINE AND CANCEL THE POLICY OR AN INCREASE IN FACE AMOUNT?              

Yes. The Policy provides for an initial "Free-Look" period. You may cancel the  
Policy by mailing or delivering the Policy to the Principal Office or an agent  
of the Company on or before the latest of:                                      

-    45 days after the application for the Policy is signed, or       

   -    10 days after you receive the Policy (or longer if required by state
law), or                                                    

 -    10 days after the Company mails or personally delivers a notice of
withdrawal rights to you.                                   

  -    60 days from issuance and acceptance if the Policy was purchased in
New York as a replacement for an existing Policy.           

When you return the Policy, the Company will mail a refund to you within seven  
days. The refund of any premium paid by check, however, may be delayed until the
check has cleared your bank.                                                    

Where required by state law, the refund will equal the premiums paid. In all    
other states or if you purchased the Policy in New York as a replacement, the   
refund will equal the sum of:                                                   

(1)  Amounts allocated to the Fixed Account, plus                     

(2)  the policy value in the Variable Account, plus                   

(3)  all fees, charges and taxes which have been imposed .            

FREE LOOK WITH FACE AMOUNT INCREASES                                            

P-->485APOS19th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
After an increase in the Face Amount, the Company will mail or personally       
deliver a notice of a "Free Look" with respect to the increase. You will have   
the right to cancel the increase before the latest of:                          

-    45 days after the application for the increase is signed, or     

    -    10 days after you receive the new specifications pages issued for the
increase (or longer if required by state law), or           

 -    10 days after the Company mails or delivers a notice of withdrawal
rights to you.                                              

Upon canceling the increase, you will receive a credit to your Policy Value of  
charges deducted for the increase. We will refund to you the amount to be       
credited if you request. The Company also will waive any surrender charge       
calculated for the increase.                                                    

IS THERE A PAID-UP INSURANCE OPTION?                                            

On written request, you may elect life insurance coverage, usually for a reduced
amount, for the life of the Insured with no further premiums due. The paid-up   
insurance will be the amount, up to the face amount of the Policy, that the     
surrender value can purchase for a net single premium at the Insured's age and  
underwriting class on the date this option is elected. If the surrender value   
exceeds the net single premium, we will pay the excess to you. The net single   
premium is based on the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables,  
Smoker or Non-Smoker (Table B for unisex policies) with increases in the tables 
for non-standard risks. Interest will not be less than 4.5%.                    

IF THE PAID-UP INSURANCE OPTION IS ELECTED, THE FOLLOWING POLICY OWNER RIGHTS   
AND BENEFITS WILL BE AFFECTED:                                                  

 -    As described above, the paid-up insurance benefit will be computed
        differently from the net death benefit and the death benefit options
will not apply                                              

 -    We will not allow transfers of policy value from the fixed account
back to the variable account                                

-    You may not make further payments                                

-    You may not increase or decrease the face amount or make partial 
withdrawals                                                 

-    Riders will continue only with our consent                       

You may, after electing paid-up insurance, surrender the Policy for its net cash
value. The guaranteed cash value is the net single premium for the paid-up      
insurance at the Insured's attained age. The net cash value is the cash value   
less any outstanding loan. We will transfer the policy value in the variable    
account to the fixed account on the date we receive written request to elect the
option.                                                                         

On election of paid-up insurance, the Policy often will become a modified       
endowment contract. If a Policy becomes a modified endowment contract, Policy   
loans or surrender will receive unfavorable federal tax treatment.              

DOES THE COMPANY SUPPORT INCENTIVE FUNDING DISCOUNTING?                         

Yes. The Company will lower the cost of insurance charges by 5% during any      
Policy year for which you qualify for an incentive funding discount. To qualify,
total premiums paid under the Policy, less any debt, withdrawals and withdrawal 
charges, and transfers from other policies issued by the Company, must exceed   
90% of the guideline level premiums (as defined in Section 7702 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), accumulated from the Date of Issue to the    
date of qualification. The incentive funding discount is not available in all   
states.                                                                         

The amount needed to qualify for the incentive funding discount is determined on
the Date of Issue for the first Policy year and on each Policy anniversary for  
each subsequent Policy year. If the Company receives the proceeds from a Policy 
issued by an unaffiliated company to be exchanged for the Policy, however, the  
qualification for the incentive funding discount for the first Policy year will 
be determined on the date the proceeds are received by the Company, and only    
insurance charges becoming due after the date such proceeds are received will be
eligible for the incentive funding discount.                                    

HOW DO I MAKE PAYMENTS?                                                         

Payments are payable to the Company, and may be mailed to the Principal Office  
or paid through one of the Company's

authorized agents. All premium payments after the initial premium payment are   
credited to the Variable Account or the General Account as of date of receipt at
the Principal Office. Payments received before the close of business (usually   
4:00 p.m. Eastern time, or the close of the New York Stock Exchange, if earlier)
on a business day will normally be credited to the Variable Account or the Fixed
Account as of the end of that day. If we receive your payment after the close of
business on a business day, your payment or request will be effective as of the 
end of the next business day.                                                   

PREMIUM FLEXIBILITY                                                             

Unlike conventional insurance policies, the Policy does not obligate you to pay 
premiums in accordance with a rigid and inflexible premium schedule. You may    
establish a schedule of planned premiums which will be billed by the Company at 
regular intervals. Failure to pay planned premiums will not itself cause the    
Policy to lapse. However, if the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit rider is in  
effect, certain minimum premium payment tests must be met.                      

You also may make unscheduled premium payments at any time prior to the Final   
Premium Payment Date or skip planned premium payments, subject to the maximum   
and minimum premium limitations described below.                                

You also may elect to pay premiums by means of a monthly automatic payment      
procedure. Under this procedure, amounts will be deducted each month from your  
checking account, generally on the Monthly Payment Date, from your checking     
account and applied as a premium under a Policy. The minimum payment permitted  
under this procedure is $50.                                                    

Premiums are not limited as to frequency and number. No premium payment may be  
less than $100, however, without the Company's consent. Moreover, premium       
payments must be sufficient to provide a positive Surrender Value at the end of 
each Policy month, or the Policy may lapse.                                     

MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR                                                          

The Minimum Monthly Factor is a monthly premium amount calculated by the Company
and specified in the Policy. If, in the first 48 Policy months following Date of
Issue or the effective date of an increase in the Face Amount or of a Policy    
Change which causes a change in the Minimum Monthly Factor:                     

    -    You make premium payments (less debt, partial withdrawals and partial
        withdrawal charges) at least equal to the sum of the Minimum Monthly
        Factors for the number of months the Policy, increase in Face Amount
or Policy Change has been in force, and                     

-    Debt does not exceed Policy Value less surrender charges, then   

-    the Policy is guaranteed not to lapse during that period.        

EXCEPT FOR THE 48 POLICY MONTH PERIODS, MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS AT LEAST EQUAL  
TO THE MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE POLICY WILL REMAIN IN 
FORCE.                                                                          

In no event may the total of all premiums paid exceed the current maximum       
premium limitations set forth in the Policy, which are required by federal tax  
laws. These maximum premium limitations will change whenever there is any change
in the Face Amount, the addition or deletion of a rider, or a change in the Sum 
Insured Option. If a premium is paid which would result in total premiums       
exceeding the current maximum premium limitations, the Company will accept only 
that portion of the premiums that shall make total premiums equal the maximum.  
Any part of the premiums in excess of that amount will be returned, and no      
further premiums will be accepted until allowed by the current maximum premium  
limitation prescribed by Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rules. Notwithstanding
the current maximum premium limitations, however, the Company will accept a     
premium that is needed in order to prevent a lapse of the Policy during a Policy
year.                                                                           

HOW DO I ALLOCATE MY NET PAYMENTS?                                              

The Net Premium equals the premium paid less the 3.50% (2.75% in New York)      
payment expense charge. In the application for a Policy, you indicate the       
initial allocation of Net Premiums among the General Account and the            
Sub-Accounts of the Variable Account. You may allocate premiums to one or more  
Sub-Accounts, but may not have Policy Value in more than 20 Sub-Accounts at any 
one time. The minimum amount that may be allocated to a Sub-Account is 1% of Net
Premium paid. Allocation percentages must be in whole numbers (for example,     
33 1/3% may not be chosen) and must total 100%.                                 

P-->485APOS21st�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
FUTURE CHANGES ALLOWED                                                          

You may change the allocation of future Net Premiums at any time pursuant to    
written or telephone request. An allocation change will be effective as of the  
date of receipt of the notice at the Principal Office.                          

INVESTMENT RISK                                                                 

The Policy Value in the Sub-Accounts will vary with their investment experience;
you bear this investment risk. The investment performance may affect the Death  
Proceeds as well. Policyowners should periodically review their allocations of  
premiums and Policy Value in light of market conditions and overall financial   
planning requirements.                                                          

CAN I MAKE TRANSFERS?                                                           

Yes. Subject to the Company's then current rules, you may transfer the Policy   
Value among the Sub-Accounts or between a Sub-Account and the General Account.  
However, the Policy Value held in the General Account to secure a Policy loan   
may not be transferred. If we receive a transfer request after the close of     
business (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or the close of the New York Stock   
Exchange, if earlier), it will be effected at the end of the next business day. 

IS THE TRANSFER PRIVILEGE SUBJECT TO ANY LIMITATIONS?                           

Yes. The transfer privilege is subject to the Company's consent. The Company    
reserves the right to impose limitations on transfers including, but not limited
to:                                                                             

-    the minimum or maximum amount that may be transferred,           

-    the minimum amount that may remain in a Sub-Account following a  
transfer from that Sub-Account,                             

-    the minimum period of time between transfers, and                

-    the maximum number of transfers in a period.                     

Currently, transfers to and from the General Account are permitted only if:     

   -    there has been at least a 90-day period since the last transfer from
the General Account, and                                    

    -    the amount transferred from the General Account in each transfer does
     not exceed the lesser of $100,000 or 25% of the Accumulated Value
under the Policy.                                           

If you request a transfer from a Sub-Account that is higher than your Policy    
Value in the Sub-Account on the Valuation Date for the transfer request (for    
example, if you request a transfer of $100 from a Sub-Account and the Policy    
Value in the Sub-Account is only $98 on the Valuation Date), we will transfer   
all of the Policy Value in the Sub-Account.                                     

Currently, the first 12 transfers in a Policy year will be free of any charge.  
Thereafter, a $10 transfer charge will be deducted from the amount transferred  
for each transfer in that Policy year. The Company may increase or decrease this
charge, but it is guaranteed never to exceed $25. Any transfers made with       
respect to a conversion privilege, Policy loan or material change in investment 
Policy will not count towards the 12 free transfers.                            

These rules are subject to change by the Company.                               

ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON MARKET TIMERS?                                        

Yes. The Policy is not designed for use by individuals, professional market     
timing organizations, or other entities that do "market timing," programmed     
transfers, frequent transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the   
total assets of an Underlying Fund. These and similar activities may adversely  
affect a Fund's ability to invest effectively in accordance with its investment 
objectives and policies, and may harm other Policyowners. Accordingly,          
individuals and organizations that use market-timing investment strategies and  
make frequent transfers should not invest in the Policy.                        

In order to prevent "market timing" activities that may harm or disadvantage    
other Policyowners, the Company may (a) reject or restrict any specific purchase
and transfer requests and (b) impose specific limitations with respect to       

P-->485APOS22nd�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
market timers, including restricting transfers by market timers to certain      
Underlying Funds. In addition, some of the Underlying Funds have reserved the   
right to temporarily or permanently refuse purchase or transfer requests from   
the Company if, in the judgment of the Underlying Fund's investment adviser, the
Underlying Fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its    
investment objective or policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely   
affected. Accordingly, the Company may not be in a position to effect certain   
transfers requested by market timers and may refuse such transfer requests      
without prior notice. We reserve the right to impose, without prior notice,     
restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will       
disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other Policyowners. 
If any of these actions are taken, we will notify the market timer of the action
as soon as practicable.                                                         

IS THERE A DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING OPTION OR AUTOMATIC REBALANCING OPTION?        

Yes.  You may have automatic transfers of at least $100 a month made on a       
periodic basis:                                                                 

  -    from the Sub-Accounts which invest in the AIT Money Market Fund and
       AIT Government Bond Fund, respectively, to one or more of the other
Sub-Accounts ("Dollar-Cost Averaging Option"), or           

-    to reallocate Policy Value among the Sub-Accounts ("Automatic    
Rebalancing Option").                                       

Automatic transfers may be made on a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual
or annual schedule. The first automatic transfer counts as one transfer towards 
the 12 free transfers allowed in each Policy year; each subsequent automatic    
transfer is without charge and does not reduce the remaining number of transfers
which may be made free of charge. Generally, all transfers will be processed on 
the 15th of each scheduled month. If the 15th is not a business day, however, or
is the Monthly Payment Date, the automatic transfer will be processed on the    
next business day. The Dollar-Cost Averaging Option and the Automatic           
Rebalancing Option may not be in effect at the same time.                       

If the policy goes into a grace period (see WHAT ARE THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS 
OF THE POLICY?, under TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT), automatic Dollar Cost     
Averaging and Automatic Account Rebalancing transactions are suspended. If you  
make sufficient payments to keep the policy in force, Dollar Cost Averaging and 
Automatic Account Rebalancing will resume with the next scheduled automatic     
transaction.                                                                    

CAN I MAKE FUTURE CHANGES UNDER MY POLICY?                                      

Yes. There are several changes you can make after receiving your Policy, within 
limits. You may:                                                                

-    Cancel your Policy under its right-to-examine provision          
-    Transfer your ownership to someone else                          
-    Change the beneficiary                                           
-    Change the allocation of payments, with no tax consequences under
current law                                                 
-    Make transfers of policy value among the funds                   
   -    Adjust the death benefit by increasing or decreasing the face amount
   -    Change your choice of death benefit options between the Level Option
and Adjustable Option                                       
-    Add or remove optional insurance benefits provided by Rider      

HOW DO I CHANGE THE FACE AMOUNT OF MY POLICY?                                   

Subject to certain limitations, you may increase or decrease the specified Face 
Amount of a Policy at any time by submitting a Written Request to the Company.  

You may increase or decrease the face amount by written request. An increase or 
decrease in the face amount takes effect on the LATEST of the:                  

  -    The monthly processing date on or next following date of receipt of
your written request OR                                     
-    The date of approval of your written request, if evidence of     
insurability is required                                    

INCREASES IN THE FACE AMOUNT                                                    

You must submit satisfactory evidence of insurability with your written request 
for an increase. The consent of the                                             

P-->485APOS23rd�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
Insured is also required whenever the face amount is increased. An increase in  
face amount may not be less than $10,000. You may not increase the face amount  
after the Insured reaches age 80. A written request for an increase must include
a payment if the surrender value is less than the sum of:                       

-    $50 PLUS                                                         

-    Two minimum monthly payments                                     

On the effective date of each increase in face amount, we will deduct a         
transaction charge of $50 from policy value for administrative costs. We will   
also compute a surrender charge for the increase. An increase in the face amount
will increase the insurance protection amount and, therefore, the monthly       
insurance protection charges.                                                   

After increasing the face amount, you will have the right, during a free-look   
period, to have the increase canceled. See THE POLICY -- "FREE-LOOK PERIOD." If 
you exercise this right, we will credit to your Policy the charges deducted for 
the increase, unless you request a refund of these charges.                     

An increase in the Face Amount generally will affect the Insurance Amount at    
Risk, and may affect the portion of the Insurance Amount at Risk included in    
various Premium Classes (if more than one Premium Class applies), both of which 
may affect the monthly cost of insurance charges. A surrender charge also will  
be calculated for the increase.                                                 

DECREASES IN THE FACE AMOUNT                                                    

You may decrease the face amount by written request. The minimum amount for a   
decrease in face amount is $10,000. The minimum face amount in force after a    
decrease is $40,000. We may limit the decrease or return policy value to you, as
you choose, if the Policy would not comply with the maximum payment limitation  
under federal tax law. A return of policy value may result in tax liability to  
you.                                                                            

A decrease in the face amount will lower the insurance protection amount and,   
therefore, the monthly insurance protection charge. In computing the monthly    
insurance protection charge, a decrease in the face amount will reduce the face 
amount in the following order:                                                  

-    the Face Amount provided by the most recent increase;            
-    the next most recent increases successively; and                 
-    the initial Face Amount                                          

On a decrease in the face amount, we will deduct from the policy value a        
transaction charge of $50 and, if applicable, any surrender charge. You may     
allocate the deduction to one sub-account. If you make no allocation, we will   
make a pro-rata allocation. We will reduce the surrender charge by the amount of
any surrender charge deducted.                                                  

CAN I CONVERT MY POLICY INTO A FIXED POLICY?                                    

Once during the first 24 months after the Date of Issue or after the effective  
date of an increase in Face Amount (assuming the Policy is in force), you may   
convert your Policy without Evidence of Insurability to a flexible premium      
adjustable life insurance policy with fixed and guaranteed minimum benefits.    
Assuming that there have been no increases in the initial Face Amount, you can  
accomplish this within 24 months after the Date of Issue by transferring,       
without charge, the Policy Value in the Variable Account to the General Account 
and by simultaneously changing your premium allocation instructions to allocate 
future premium payments to the General Account. Within 24 months after the      
effective date of each increase, you can transfer, without charge, all or part  
of the Policy Value in the Variable Account to the General Account and          
simultaneously change your premium allocation instructions to allocate all or   
part of future premium payments to the General Account.                         

Where required by state law, at your request the Company will issue a flexible  
premium adjustable life insurance Policy to you. The new Policy will have the   
same Face Amount, Issue Age, Dates of Issue, and Premium Class as the original  
Policy.                                                                         

CAN I MAKE POLICY LOANS?                                                        

You may borrow money secured by your policy value. The total amount you may     
borrow, including any outstanding                                               

P-->485APOS24th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
loan, is the loan value. In the first Policy year, the loan value is 75% of:    

-    The policy value MINUS                                           

     -    Any surrender charges, unpaid monthly insurance protection charges and
outstanding loan interest through the end of the Policy year

After the first Policy year, the loan value is 90% of:                          

-    The policy value MINUS                                           

-    Any surrender charges                                            

There is no minimum loan. We will usually pay the loan within seven days after  
we receive the written request. We may delay the payment of loans as stated in  
OTHER POLICY PROVISIONS -- "DELAY OF PAYMENTS." 

We will allocate the loan among the sub-accounts and the fixed account according
to your instructions. If you do not make an allocation, we will make a pro-rata 
allocation. We will transfer policy value in each sub-account equal to the      
Policy loan to the fixed account. We will not count this transfer as a transfer 
subject to the transfer charge.                                                 

Policy value equal to the outstanding loan will earn monthly interest in the    
fixed account at an annual rate of at least 6.0% (at least 8.0% for preferred   
loans). NO OTHER INTEREST WILL BE CREDITED.                                     

If you are a participant under a Section 403(b) TSA plan and purchased the      
Policy in connection with the plan, your Policy loan rights are limited. See    
"POLICIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS" below, and FEDERAL TAX           
CONSIDERATIONS -- "POLICIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS." 
PREFERRED LOAN OPTION                                                           

This option is available to you upon written request after the first Policy     
year. You may change a preferred loan to a non-preferred loan at any time upon  
written request. It may be revoked by you at any time. A request for a preferred
loan after the Final Payment Date will terminate the optional Guaranteed Death  
Benefit Rider.                                                                  

The preferred loan option is available during Policy years 2-10 only if your    
policy value, minus the surrender charge, is $50,000 or more. The option applies
to up to 10% of this amount. After the 10th Policy year, the preferred loan     
option is available on all loans or on all or a part of the loan value as you   
request. The guaranteed annual interest rate credited to the policy value       
securing a preferred loan is at least 8%.                                       

There is some uncertainty as to the tax treatment of preferred loans, which may 
be treated as a taxable distribution from the Policy. Please consult a qualified
tax adviser. THE PREFERRED LOAN OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL STATES.          

LOAN INTEREST CHARGED                                                           

Outstanding Policy loans are charged interest. Interest accrues daily and is    
payable in arrears at the annual rate of 8%. Interest is due and payable at the 
end of each Policy year or on a pro-rata basis for such shorter period as the   
loan may exist.                                                                 

Interest not paid when due will be added to the loan amount and will bear     
interest at the same rate. If the new loan amount exceeds the Policy Value in   
the General Account after the due and unpaid interest is added to the loan      
amount, the Company will the transfer Policy Value equal to that excess loan    
amount from the Policy Value in each Sub-Account to the General Account as      
security for the excess loan amount. The Company will allocate the amount       
transferred among the Sub-Accounts in the same proportion that the Policy Value 
in each Sub-Account bears to the total Policy Value in all Sub-Accounts.        

REPAYMENT OF LOANS                                                              

You may pay any loans before Policy lapse. We will allocate that part of the    
policy value in the fixed account that secured a repaid loan to the sub-accounts
and fixed account according to your instructions. If you do not make a repayment
allocation, we will allocate policy value according to your most recent payment 
allocation instructions. However, loan repayments allocated to the variable     
account cannot exceed policy value previously transferred from the variable     
account to secure the outstanding loan.                                         

P-->485APOS25th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
If the outstanding loan exceeds the policy value less the surrender charge, the 
Policy will terminate. We will mail a notice of termination to the last known   
address of you and any assignee. If you do not make sufficient payment within 62
days after this notice is mailed, the Policy will terminate with no value. The  
foreclosure of an outstanding loan will terminate the optional Guaranteed Death 
Benefit Rider.                                                                  

EFFECT OF POLICY LOANS                                                          

We will deduct any outstanding loan from the proceeds payable when the          
Insured dies or from a surrender. Although Policy loans may be repaid at any    
time prior to the lapse of the Policy, Policy loans will permanently affect     
the Policy Value and Surrender Value, and may permanently affect the Death      
Proceeds. The effect could be favorable or unfavorable, depending upon          
whether the investment performance of the Sub-Account(s) is less than or        
greater than the interest credited to the Policy Value in the General Account   
attributable to the loan. Moreover, outstanding Policy loans and the accrued    
interest will be deducted from the proceeds payable upon the death of the       
Insured or surrender.                                                           

ARE POLICY LOANS PERMITTED IF THE POLICY WAS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A TSA    
PLAN?                                                                           

If your Policy was issued in connection with a TSA plan, Policy loans are       
permitted in accordance with the terms of the Policy. However, if a Policy loan 
does not comply with the requirements of Code Section 72(p), the TSA plan may   
become disqualified and Policy Values may be includible in your current income. 
Policy loans must meet the following additional requirements:                   

   -    Loans must be repaid within five years, except when the loan is used
        to acquire any dwelling unit which within a reasonable time is to be
used as the Policy owner's principal residence.             

-    All Policy loans must be amortized on a level basis with loan    
repayments being made not less frequently than quarterly.   

 -    The sum of all outstanding loan balances for all loans from all of
your TSA plans may not exceed the lesser of:                

          -    $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding
              balance of loans from all of the Policy owner's TSA plans during
           the one-year period preceding the date of the loan, minus the
               outstanding balance of loans from the Policy owner's TSA plans on
the date on which such loan was made;             

OR

         -    50% of the Policy owner's non-forfeitable accrued benefit in all
of his/her TSA plans, but not less than $10,000.  

A QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER SHOULD BE CONSULTED BEFORE REQUESTING A POLICY LOAN IN  
CONNECTION WITH A TSA PLAN.                                                     
CAN I SURRENDER THE POLICY?                                                     

You may surrender the Policy and receive its surrender value. The surrender     
value is:                                                                       

-        The policy value MINUS                                                 
-        Any outstanding loan and surrender charges                             

We will compute the surrender value on the valuation date on which we receive   
the Policy with a written request for surrender. We will deduct a surrender     
charge if you surrender the Policy within 10 full Policy years of the date of   
issue or increase in face amount. See CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS.                   

The surrender value may be paid in a lump sum or under a payment option then    
offered by us. We will normally pay the surrender value within seven days       
following our receipt of written request. We may delay benefit payments under   
certain circumstances.                                                          

For important tax consequences of a surrender, see FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS.  
If the Policy is issued in connection with a Section 403(b) Plan, your surrender
rights may be restricted. See FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS --POLICIES ISSUED IN   
CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS."                                                     
CAN I MAKE PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS?                                                 

P-->485APOS26th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
Yes. After the first Policy year, you may withdraw part of the surrender value  
of your Policy on written request. Your written request must state the dollar   
amount you wish to receive. You may allocate the amount withdrawn among the     
sub-accounts and the fixed account. If you do not provide allocation            
instructions, we will make a pro-rata allocation. Each partial withdrawal must  
be at least $500. Under the Level Option, the face amount is reduced by the     
partial withdrawal. We will not allow a partial withdrawal if it would reduce   
the Level Option face amount below $40,000.                                     

A withdrawal from a Sub-Account will result in the cancellation of the number of
Accumulation Units equivalent in value to the amount withdrawn. The amount      
withdrawn equals the amount requested by you plus the transaction charge and any
applicable partial withdrawal charge. Normally, the Company will pay the amount 
of the partial withdrawal within seven days following the Company's receipt of  
the partial withdrawal request, but the Company may delay payment under certain 
circumstances.                                                                  

For important tax consequences of partial withdrawals, see FEDERAL TAX          
CONSIDERATIONS. If the Policy is issued in connection with a Section 403(b)     
Plan, your withdrawal rights may be restricted. See FEDERAL TAX                 
CONSIDERATIONS -- "POLICIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS." 
WHAT IS THE POLICY VALUE?                                                       

The Policy Value is the total value of your Policy. It is the SUM of your       
accumulation in the fixed account PLUS The value of your units in the           
sub-accounts There is no guaranteed minimum policy value. Policy value on any   
date depends on variables that cannot be predetermined.                         

Your policy value is affected by the:                                           

-    Frequency and amount of your net payments                        
-    Interest credited in the fixed account                           
-    Investment performance of your sub-accounts                      
-    Partial withdrawals                                              
-    Loans, loan repayments and loan interest paid or credited        
-    Charges and deductions under the Policy                          
-    The death benefit option                                         

COMPUTING POLICY VALUE                                                          

We compute the policy value on the date of issue and on each valuation date. On 
the date of issue, the policy value is:                                         

 -    The value of the amount allocated to the money market fund, net of
       mortality and expense risk charges, administrative charges and fund
expenses, MINUS                                             

-    The monthly insurance protection charge due                      

On each valuation date after the date of issue, the policy value is the SUM of  
accumulations in the fixed account PLUS The SUM of the PRODUCTS of:             

-    The number of units in each sub-account TIMES                    

-    The value of a unit in each sub-account on the valuation date    

THE UNIT                                                                        

We allocate each net payment to the sub-accounts you selected. We credit        
allocations to the sub-accounts as units. Units are credited separately for each
sub-account.                                                                    

The number of units of each sub-account credited to the Policy is the QUOTIENT  
of:                                                                             

   -    That part of the net payment allocated to the sub-account DIVIDED BY

-    The dollar value of a unit on the valuation date the payment is  
received at our principal office                            

The number of units will remain fixed unless changed by a split of unit value,  
transfer, partial withdrawal or surrender.                                      

P-->485APOS27th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
Also, each deduction of charges from a sub-account will result in cancellation  
of units equal in value to the amount deducted.                                 

The dollar value of a unit of a sub-account varies from valuation date to       
valuation date based on the investment experience of that sub-account. This     
investment experience reflects the investment performance, expenses and charges 
of the fund in which the sub-account invests. The value of each unit was set at 
$1.00 on the first valuation date of each sub-account. The value of a unit on   
any valuation date is the PRODUCT of:                                           

 -    The dollar value of the unit on the preceding valuation date TIMES

-    The net investment factor                                        

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR                                                           

The net investment factor measures the investment performance of a sub-account  
during the valuation period just ended. The net investment factor for each      
sub-account is 1.0000 PLUS the QUOTIENT of:                                     

  -    The investment income of that sub-account for the valuation period,
         adjusted for realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and for
taxes during the valuation period, DIVIDED BY               

-    The value of that sub-account's assets at the beginning of the   
valuation period MINUS                                      

  -    The mortality and expense risk charge for each day in the valuation
      period currently at an annual rate of 0.65% of the daily net asset
value of that sub-account AND                               

   -    The administrative charge for each day in the valuation period at an
         annual rate of 0.15% of the daily net asset value of that sub-account
(only during the first ten Policy years)                    

The net investment factor may be greater or less than one. Therefore, the value 
of a Unit may increase or decrease. You bear the investment risk.               

Allocations to the General Account are not converted into Accumulation Units,   
but are credited interest at a rate periodically set by the Company. See        
__________________________.                                                     

 THE DEATH BENEFIT

The Policy provides two death benefit options: The Level Option and the         
Adjustable Option (for more information, see WHAT ARE THE LEVEL OPTION AND      
ADJUSTABLE OPTION?, below). If the Policy is in force on the Insured's death, we
will, with due proof of death, pay the net death benefit under the applicable   
death benefit option to the named beneficiary. We will normally pay the net     
death benefit within seven days of receiving due proof of the Insured's death,  
but we may delay payment of net death benefits. See OTHER POLICY PROVISIONS --  
"DELAY OF PAYMENTS." The beneficiary may receive the net death benefit in a lump
sum or under a payment option.                                                  

Before the final payment date, the net death benefit is:                        

-    The death benefit provided under the Level Option or Adjustable  
        Option, whichever is elected and in effect on the date of death PLUS

  -    Any other insurance on the Insured's life that is provided by Rider
MINUS                                                       

  -    Any outstanding loan, partial withdrawals, partial withdrawal costs
       and due and unpaid monthly insurance protection charges through the
Policy month in which the Insured dies                      

After the final payment date, if the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is not in   
effect, the net death benefit is:                                               

-    The policy value MINUS                                           

-    Any outstanding loan                                             

Where permitted by state law, we will compute the Net Death Benefit on          

-    The date we receive due proof of the Insured's death under the   
Adjustable Option OR                                        

P-->485APOS28th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
-    The date of death for the Level Option.                          

If required by state law, we will compute the Net Death Benefit on the date of  
death for the Adjustable Option as well as for the Level Option.                

WHAT ARE THE LEVEL OPTION AND THE ADJUSTABLE OPTION OPTION?                     

The Policy provides two death benefit options: the Level Option and Adjustable  
Option. You choose the desired option in the application or enrollment form. You
may change the option once per Policy year by written request. There is no      
charge for a change in option.                                                  

Under the Level Option, the death benefit is the GREATER of the:                

-    Face amount OR                                                   
-    Guideline minimum sum insured                                    

Under the Adjustable Option, the death benefit is the GREATER of the:           

-    Face amount plus policy value OR                                 
-    Guideline minimum sum insured                                    

The Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is a percentage of the policy value, as       
computed based on federal tax regulations, which will ensure that the Policy    
qualifies as a life insurance contract and that the insurance proceeds will be  
excluded from the gross income of the beneficiary.                              

Under both the Level Option and Adjustable Option, the death benefit provides   
insurance protection. Under the Level Option, the death benefit is level unless 
the guideline minimum sum insured exceeds the face amount; then, the death      
benefit varies as the policy value changes. Under the Adjustable Option, the    
death benefit always varies as the policy value changes.                        

At any face amount, the death benefit will be greater under the Adjustable      
Option than under the Level Option because the policy value is added to the face
amount and included in the death benefit. However, the monthly insurance        
protection charge will be greater. Therefore, policy value will accumulate at a 
slower rate than under the Level Option.                                        

If you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected in the death
benefit, you should choose the Adjustable Option. If you desire to have payments
and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the policy value, 
you should select the Level Option.                                             

CAN I CHANGE THE DEATH BENEFIT OPTION?                                          

You may change the death benefit option once each Policy year by written        
request. Changing options will not require evidence of insurability. The change 
takes effect on the monthly processing date on or following the date of receipt 
of the written request. We will impose no charge for changes in death benefit   
options.                                                                        

If you change the Level Option to the Adjustable Option, we will decrease the   
face amount to equal:                                                           

-    The death benefit MINUS                                          
-    The policy value on the date of the change                       

The change may not be made if the face amount would fall below $40,000. After   
the change from the Level Option to the Adjustable Option, future monthly       
insurance protection charges may be higher or lower than if no change in option 
had been made. However, the insurance protection amount will always equal the   
face amount unless the guideline minimum sum insured applies.                   

If you change the Adjustable Option to the Level Option, we will increase the   
face amount by the policy value on the date of the change. The death benefit    
will be the GREATER of:                                                         

P-->485APOS29th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
-    The new face amount or                                           

-    The guideline minimum sum insured                                

After the change from the Adjustable Option to the Level Option, an increase in 
policy value will reduce the insurance protection amount and the monthly        
insurance protection charge. A decrease in policy value will increase the       
insurance protection amount and the monthly insurance protection charge.        

A change in death benefit option may result in total payments exceeding the then
current maximum payment limitation under federal tax law. If this occurs, we    
will pay the excess to you.                                                     

A change from the Adjustable Death Benefit option to the Level Benefit option   
within five policy years of the Final Payment Date will terminate a Guaranteed  
Death Benefit Rider.                                                            

IS  A GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT AVAILABLE?                                       

An optional Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is available only at issue of the    
Policy. If this Rider is in effect, the Company:                                

-    guarantees that your Policy will not lapse regardless of the     
investment performance of the Variable Account and          

-    provides a guaranteed net death benefit.                         

In order to maintain the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider, certain minimum premium
payment tests must be met on each Policy anniversary and within 48 months       
following the Date of Issue and/or the date of any increase in Face Amount, as  
described below. In addition, a one-time administrative charge of $25 will be   
deducted from Policy Value when the Rider is elected. Certain transactions,     
including policy loans, partial withdrawals, and changes in Sum Insured Options,
can result in the termination of the Rider. If this Rider is terminated, it     
cannot be reinstated.                                                           

GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT TESTS                                                  

While the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Policy will not lapse
if the following two tests are met:                                             

1.   Within 48 months following the Date of Issue of the Policy or of any       
   increase in the Face Amount, the sum of the premiums paid, less any debt,
partial withdrawals and withdrawal charges, must be greater than the  
minimum monthly payment multiplied by the number of months which have 
elapsed since the relevant Date of Issue; and                         

2.   On each Policy anniversary, (a) must exceed (b), where, since the Date of  
Issue:                                                                

    (a)  is the sum of your premiums, less any withdrawals, partial withdrawal
 charges and Debt which is classified as a preferred loan; and

    (b)  is the sum of the minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit premiums, as shown
on the specifications page of the Policy.                   

GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT                                                        

If the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect on the Final Premium Payment 
Date, a guaranteed Death Benefit will be provided as long as the Rider is in    
force. The Death Benefit will be the greater of:                                

-    the Face Amount as of the Final Premium Payment Date; or         
    -    the Policy Value as of the date due proof of death is received by the
Company.                                                    

TERMINATION OF THE GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER                               

The Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider will end and may not be reinstated on the    
first to occur of the following:                                                

-    foreclosure of an outstanding loan; or                           

     -    the date on which the sum of your payments does not meet or exceed the
applicable Guaranteed Death Benefit test (above); or        

    -    any Policy change that results in a negative guideline level premium;
or                                                          

P-->485APOS30th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
-    the effective date of a change from the Adjustable Death Benefit 
          Option to the Level Death Benefit Option, if such changes occur within
5 policy years of the Final Payment Date; or                

     -    a request for a partial withdrawal or preferred loan is made after the
Final Premium Payment Date.                                 

It is possible that the Policy Value will not be sufficient to keep the Policy  
in force on the first Monthly Payment Date following the date the Rider         
terminates.                                                                     

WHAT ARE THE DEATH BENEFIT PAYMENT OPTIONS?                                     

During the Insured's lifetime, you may arrange for the Death Benefit to be paid 
in a single sum or under one or more of the available payment options. These    
choices also are available at the Final Premium Payment Date and if the Policy  
is surrendered. The Company may make more payment options available in the      
future.                                                                         

If no election is made, the Company will pay the Death Benefit in a single sum. 
When the Death Benefit is payable in a single sum, the Beneficiary may, within  
one year of the Insured's death, select one or more of the payment options if no
payments have yet been made.                                                    

The amounts payable under a payment option for each $1,000 value applied will be
the greater of:                                                                 

-    The rate per $1,000 of value applied based on the Company's      
  non-guaranteed current payment option rates for the Policy, or

-    The rate in the Policy for the applicable payment option.        

The following payment options are currently available. The amounts payable under
these options are paid from the General Account. None is based on the investment
experience of the Variable Account.                                             

 Option A:    PAYMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF YEARS. The Company will
             make equal payments for any selected number of years (not
    greater than 30). Payments may be made annually,
semi-annually, quarterly or monthly.        

Option B:    LIFETIME  MONTHLY  PAYMENTS. Payments are based on the   
                  payee's age on the date the first payment will be made. One of
               three variations may be chosen. Depending upon this choice,
payments will end:                          

       (1)   upon the death of the payee, with no further payments due
(Life Annuity), or                          

        (2)   upon the death of the payee, but not before the sum of the
                  payments made first equals or exceeds the amount applied under
          this option (Life Annuity with Installment Refund), or

           (3)   upon the death of the payee, but not before a selected period
             (5, 10 or 20 years) has elapsed (Life Annuity with Period
Certain).                                   

 Option C:    INTEREST PAYMENTS. The Company will pay interest at a rate
              determined by the Company each year, but which will not be
                 less than 3.5%. Payments may be made annually, semi-annually,
                quarterly or monthly. Payments will end when the amount left
               with the Company has been withdrawn. However, payments will
                 not continue after the death of the payee. Any unpaid balance
     plus accrued interest will be paid in a lump sum.

Option D:    PAYMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. Payments will be made   
           until the unpaid balance is exhausted. Interest will be
                credited to the unpaid balance. The rate of interest will be
                  determined by the Company each year, but will not be less than
                 3.5%. Payments may be made annually, semi-annually, quarterly
               or monthly. The payment level selected must provide for the
           payment each year of at least 8% of the amount applied.

Option E:    LIFETIME  MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR TWO PAYEES. One of three  
           variations may be chosen. After the death of one payee,
payments will continue to the survivor:     

P-->485APOS31st�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
(1)   in the same amount as the original amount; or     
  (2)   in an amount equal to 2/3 of the original amount; or
(3)   in an amount equal to 1/2 of the original amount. 

Payments are based on the payees' ages on the date the first payment is due.    
Payments will end upon the death of the surviving payee.                        

SELECTION OF PAYMENT OPTIONS                                                    

The amount applied under any one option for any one payee must be at least      
$5,000. The periodic payment for any one payee must be at least $50. Subject to 
the Owner and/or the Beneficiary provisions of your Policy, any option selection
may be changed before the Death Proceeds become payable. If you make no         
selection, the Beneficiary may select an option when the Death Proceeds become  
payable.                                                                        

If the amount of monthly income payments under Option B(3) for the attained age 
of the payee are the same for different periods certain, the Company will deem  
an election to have been made for the longest period certain which could have   
been elected for such age and amount.                                           

You may give the Beneficiary the right to change from Option C or D to any other
option at any time. If the payee selects Option C or D when the Death Proceeds  
become payable, the payee may reserve the right to change to any other option at
a later date. The payee who elects to change options must also be a payee under 
the new option selected.                                                        

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS                                                             

An additional deposit may be made to any proceeds when they are applied under   
Option B or E. A charge not to exceed 3% will be made. The Company may limit the
amount of this deposit.                                                         

RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS                                                          

A payee does not have the right to assign any amount payable under any option. A
payee does not have the right to commute any amount payable under Option B or E.
A payee will have the right to commute any amount payable under Option A only if
the right is reserved in the Written Request selecting the option. If the right 
to commute is exercised, the commuted values will be computed at the interest   
rates used to calculate the benefits. The amount left under Option C, and any   
unpaid balance under Option D, may be withdrawn by the payee only as set forth  
in the Written Request selecting the option. A corporation or fiduciary payee   
may select only Option A, C or D. Such selection will be subject to the consent 
of the Company.                                                                 

PAYMENT DATES                                                                   

The first payment under any option, except Option C, will be due on the date the
Policy matures by death or otherwise, unless another date is designated.        
Payments under Option C begin at the end of the first payment period.           

The last payment under any option will be made as stated in the description of  
that option. However, should a payee under Option B or E die prior to the due   
date of the second monthly payment, the amount applied less the first monthly   
payment will be paid in a lump sum or under any option other than Option E. A   
lump sum payment will be made to the surviving payee under Option E or the      
succeeding payee under Option B.

 TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT
WHAT ARE THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY?                              

Unless the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Policy will         
terminate if:                                                                   

  -    Surrender value is insufficient to cover the next monthly insurance
protection charge plus loan interest accrued OR             

-    Outstanding loan exceeds the policy value less surrender charges 

If one of these situations occurs, the Policy will be in default. You will then 
have a grace period of 62 days, measured from the date of default, to pay a     
premium sufficient to prevent termination. On the date of default, we will send 
a notice to you and to any assignee of record. The notice will state the premium
due and the date by which it must be paid.                                      

During the grace period, automatic Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") and Automatic  
Account Rebalancing ("AAR") transactions are suspended. If you make sufficient  
payments to keep the Policy in force, DCA and AAR will resume with the next     
scheduled automatic transaction.                                                

Failure to pay a sufficient premium within the grace period will result in      
Policy termination. If the Insured dies during the grace period, we will deduct 
from the net death benefit any monthly insurance protection charges due and     
unpaid through the Policy month in which the Insured dies and any other overdue 
charge.                                                                         

During the first 48 Policy months following the date of issue or an increase in 
the face amount, a guarantee may apply to prevent the Policy from terminating   
because of insufficient surrender value. This guarantee applies if, during this 
period, you pay premiums that, when reduced by partial withdrawals and partial  
withdrawal costs, equal or exceed specified minimum monthly payments. The       
specified minimum monthly payments are based on the number of months the Policy,
increase in face amount or policy change that causes a change in the minimum    
monthly payment has been in force. A policy change that causes a change in the  
minimum monthly payment is a change in the face amount or the addition or       
deletion of a Rider. Except for the first 48 months after the date of issue or  
the effective date of an increase, payments equal to the minimum monthly payment
do not guarantee that the Policy will remain in force.                          

If the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Policy will not
lapse regardless of the investment performance of the Variable Account. See     
"GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT Rider."
WHAT ARE THE REINSTATEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY?                            

A terminated Policy may be reinstated within three years of the date of default 
and before the final payment date. The reinstatement takes effect on the monthly
processing date following the date you submit to us:                            

-    Written application for reinstatement                            
-    Evidence of insurability showing that the Insured is insurable   
according to our underwriting rules and                     
    -    A payment that, after the deduction of the payment expense charge, is
large enough to cover the minimum amount payable            

Policies which have been surrendered may not be reinstated. The Guaranteed Death
Benefit Rider may not be reinstated.                                            

MINIMUM AMOUNT PAYABLE                                                          

If reinstatement is requested when less than 48 monthly insurance protection    
charges have been paid since the date of issue or increase in the face amount,  
you must pay the lesser of:                                                     

     -    The minimum monthly payment for the three months beginning on the date
of reinstatement                                            

OR

P-->485APOS33rd�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
-    the SUM of:                                                                

    -    The amount by which the surrender charge on the date of reinstatement
exceeds the policy value on the date of default PLUS        

     -    Monthly insurance protection charges for the three months beginning on
the date of reinstatement                                   

If you request reinstatement more than 48 monthly processing dates from the date
of issue or increase in the face amount, you must pay the sum shown above       
without regard to the three months of minimum monthly payments.                 

SURRENDER CHARGE                                                                

The surrender charge on the date of reinstatement is the surrender charge that  
would have been in effect had the Policy remained in force from the date of     
issue.                                                                          

POLICY VALUE ON REINSTATEMENT                                                   

The policy value on the date of reinstatement is:                               

    -    The net payment made to reinstate the Policy and interest earned from
  the date the payment was received at our principal office PLUS

     -    The policy value less any outstanding loan on the date of default (not
      to exceed the surrender charge on the date of reinstatement) MINUS

-    The monthly insurance protection charges due on the date of      
reinstatement                                               

You may reinstate any outstanding loan.

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

The following information repeats and expands upon information contained in     
SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS: FEE TABLES. The charges described below will     
apply to your Policy under the circumstances described. Some of these charges   
apply throughout the Policy's duration. Other charges apply only if you choose  
options under the Policy.                                                       

WHAT CHARGES ARE DEDUCTED FROM PAYMENTS?                                        

Currently, we deduct 4.0% (2.75% in New York) of each payment as a payment      
expense charge. This charge includes:                                           

-    Current premium tax deduction of 2.50% (1.25% in New York)       
-    Current deferred acquisition costs ("DAC tax") deduction of 1.0% 
-    Front-end sales load of 0.5%                                     

The 2.50% premium tax deduction approximates our average expenses for state and 
local premium taxes. Premium taxes vary, ranging from zero to more than 4.0%.   
The premium tax deduction is made whether or not any premium tax applies. The   
deduction may be higher or lower than the premium tax imposed. However, we do   
not expect to make a profit from this deduction. The 1.0% DAC tax deduction     
helps reimburse us for approximate expenses incurred from federal taxes for     
deferred acquisition costs ("DAC taxes") of the Policies. We deduct the 0.5%    
front-end sales load from each payment partially to compensate us for Policy    
sales expenses.                                                                 

We reserve the right to increase or decrease the premium tax deduction or DAC   
tax deduction to reflect changes in our expenses for premium                    

WHAT ARE THE MONTHLY INSURANCE PROTECTION CHARGES?                              

Before the final payment date, we will deduct a monthly insurance protection    
charge from your policy value. This charge is the cost for insurance protection 
under the Policy, including optional insurance benefits provided by Rider.      

We deduct the monthly insurance protection charge on each monthly processing    
date starting with the date of issue. You may allocate monthly insurance        
protection charges to one sub-account. If you make no allocation, we will make a
pro-rata allocation. If the sub-account you chose does not have sufficient funds
to cover the monthly insurance protection charges, we will make a pro-rata      
allocation. We will deduct no monthly insurance protection charges on or after  
the final payment date.                                                         

We designed the monthly insurance protection charge to compensate us for the    
anticipated cost of paying net death benefits under the Policies. The charge is 
computed monthly for the initial face amount and for each increase in face      
amount. Monthly insurance protection charges can vary.                          

INITIAL FACE AMOUNT                                                             

For the initial face amount under the Level Option, the monthly insurance       
protection charge is the PRODUCT of:                                            

-    The insurance protection rate TIMES                              
  -    The DIFFERENCE between the initial face amount AND The policy value
  (MINUS any Rider charges) at the beginning of the Policy month

Under the Level Option, the monthly insurance protection charge decreases as the
policy value increases if the guideline minimum sum insured is not in effect.   

For the initial face amount under the Adjustable Option, the monthly insurance  
protection charge is the PRODUCT of:                                            

-    The insurance protection rate TIMES

For each increase in face amount under the Level Option, the monthly insurance  
protection charge is the PRODUCT of:

For each increase in face amount under the Adjustable Option, the monthly

-    The increase in face amount                                      

If the guideline minimum sum insured is in effect under either Option, we will  
compute a monthly insurance protection charge for that part of the death benefit
subject to the guideline minimum sum insured that exceeds the current death     
benefit not subject to the guideline minimum sum insured. This charge is the    
PRODUCT of:

GREATER of:                                                 
       -    The face amount OR the policy value, if you selected the Level
Option                                              

or
   -    The face amount PLUS the policy value, if you selected the
Adjustable Option                                 

We will adjust the monthly insurance protection charge for any decreases in face
amount. See THE POLICY-- "CHANGE IN FACE AMOUNT: DECREASES."
HOW ARE THE INSURANCE PROTECTION RATES DETERMINED?                              

We base insurance protection rates on the:                                      

-    Male, female or blended unisex rate table                        
-    Age and underwriting class of the Insured                        
-    Effective date of an increase or date of any Rider               

For unisex Policies, sex-distinct rates do not apply. For the initial face      
amount, the insurance protection rates are based on your age at the beginning of
each Policy year. For an increase in face amount or for a Rider, the insurance  
protection rates are based on your age on each anniversary of the effective date
of the increase or Rider. We base the current insurance protection rates on our 
expectations as to future mortality experience. Rates will not, however, be     
greater than the guaranteed insurance protection rates set forth in the Policy. 
These guaranteed rates are based on the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary    
Mortality Tables, Smoker or Non-Smoker (Mortality Table B for unisex Policies)  
and the Insured's sex and age. The Tables used for this purpose set forth       
different mortality estimates for males and females and for smokers and         
non-smokers. Any change in the insurance protection rates will apply to all     
Insureds of the same age, sex and underwriting class whose Policies have been in
force for the same period.                                                      

The underwriting class of an Insured will affect the insurance protection rates.
We currently place Insureds into preferred underwriting classes, standard       
underwriting classes and non-standard underwriting classes. The underwriting    
classes are also divided into two categories: smokers and non-smokers. We will  
place an Insured under age 18 at the date of issue in a standard or non-standard
underwriting class. We will then classify the Insured as a smoker at age 18     
unless we receive satisfactory evidence that the Insured is a non-smoker. Prior 
to the Insured's age 18, we will give you notice of how the Insured may be      
classified as a non-smoker.                                                     

We compute the insurance protection rate separately for the initial face amount 
and for any increase in face amount. However, if the Insured's underwriting     
class improves on an increase, the lower insurance protection rate will apply to
the total face amount..                                                         

WHAT CHARGES ARE MADE AGAINST OR REFLECTED IN THE ASSETS OF THE VARIABLE        
ACCOUNT?                                                                        

We assess each sub-account with a charge for mortality and expense risks we     
assume and, during the first ten Policy years, a charge for administrative      
expenses of the variable account. Fund expenses are also reflected in the       
variable account.                                                               

P-->485APOS36th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE                                               

We impose a daily charge at a current annual rate of 0.65% of the average daily 
net asset value of each sub-account. This charge compensates us for assuming    
mortality and expense risks for variable interests in the Policies. The Company 
may increase this charge, subject to state and federal law, to an annual rate no
greater than 0.80%.                                                             

The mortality risk we assume is that Insureds may live for a shorter time than  
anticipated. If this happens, we will pay more net death benefits than          
anticipated. The expense risk we assume is that the expenses incurred in issuing
and administering the Policies will exceed those compensated by the             
administrative charges in the Policies. If the charge for mortality and expense 
risks is not sufficient to cover mortality experience and expenses, we will     
absorb the losses. If the charge turns out to be higher than mortality and      
expense risk expenses, the difference will be a profit to us. If the charge     
provides us with a profit, the profit will be available for our use to pay      
distribution, sales and other expenses.                                         

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                                           

During the first ten Policy years, we impose a daily charge at an annual rate of
0.15% of the average daily net asset value in each sub-account. The charge is to
help reimburse us for administrative expenses incurred in the administration of 
the variable account and the sub-accounts. It is not expected to be a source of 
profit. The administrative functions and expenses we assume for the variable    
account and the sub-accounts include:                                           

-    Clerical, accounting, actuarial and legal services               

-    Rent, postage, telephone, office equipment and supplies          

 -    The expenses of preparing and printing registration statements and
prospectuses (not allocable to sales expense)               

-    Regulatory filing fees and other fees                            

The Company does not impose the Variable Account administrative charge after the
tenth Policy year. On the tenth Policy anniversary, the Company will convert    
your units in the Sub-Accounts to units that do not reflect the charge. There   
will be no change in your Policy Value as a result of the conversion, but the   
number of your units and the corresponding unit values will change.             

OTHER CHARGES AND FUND EXPENSES                                                 

The value of the units of the Sub-Accounts will reflect the investment advisory 
fee and other expenses of the funds whose shares the Sub-Accounts purchase. The 
prospectuses and statements of additional information of the Underlying Funds   
contain more information concerning the fees and expenses.                      

No charges are currently made against the sub-accounts for federal or state     
income taxes. Should income taxes be imposed, we may make deductions from the   
sub-accounts to pay the taxes. See FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS.                  

HOW IS THE SURRENDER CHARGE CALCULATED?                                         

The Policy's contingent surrender charge is a deferred administrative charge and
a deferred sales charge. The deferred administrative charge is designed to      
reimburse us for the administrative costs of product research and development,  
underwriting, Policy administration and surrendering the Policy. The deferred   
sales charge compensates us for distribution expenses, including commissions to 
our representatives, advertising and the printing of prospectuses and sales     
literature.                                                                     

We compute the surrender charge on date of issue and on any increase in face    
amount. The surrender charge applies for ten years from date of issue or        
increase in face amount. We impose the surrender charge only if, during its     
duration, you request a full surrender or a decrease in face amount.            

The maximum surrender charge includes a:                                        

  -    Deferred administrative charge of $8.50 per thousand dollars of the
initial face amount or increase                             
     -    Deferred sales charge of 28.5% of payments received or associated with
the increase up to the guideline annual                     

P-->485APOS37th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
premium for the increase                                    

The maximum surrender charge will not exceed a specified amount per $1,000 of   
initial face amount or increase because of state-imposed limits. The maximum    
surrender charge is level for the first 24 Policy months and then reduces by    
1/96th for the next 96 Policy months, reaching zero at the end of ten Policy    
years.                                                                          

SEPARATE SURRENDER CHARGE FOR EACH FACE AMOUNT INCREASE                         

Payments associated with an increase equal that part of the payments made on or 
after the increase that are allocated to the increase. We allocate payments     
based on relative guideline annual premium payments. For example, assume that   
the guideline annual premium is $1,500 before an increase and is $2,000 with the
increase. The policy value on the effective date of the increase would be       
allocated 75% ($1,500/$2,000) to the initial face amount and 25% to the         
increase. All future payments would also be allocated 75% to the initial face   
amount and 25% to the increase.                                                 

If more than one surrender charge is in effect because of one or more increases 
in face amount, we will apply the surrender charges in inverse order. We will   
apply surrender and partial withdrawal charges (described below) in this order: 

-    First, the most recent increase                                  
-    Second, the next most recent increases, and so on                
-    Third, the initial face amount.                                  

POSSIBLE SURRENDER CHARGE ON A FACE AMOUNT DECREASE                             

A surrender charge may be deducted on a decrease in the face amount. On a       
decrease, the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge that would  
apply to a full surrender. The fraction is the PRODUCT of:                      

-    The decrease DIVIDED by the current face amount TIMES            
-    the surrender charge                                             

Where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial    
face amount, we will deduct a proportionate share of the surrender charge for   
that increase or for the initial face amount.                                   

WHAT CHARGES APPLY TO A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL?                                     

For each partial withdrawal, we deduct a transaction fee of 2.0% of the amount  
withdrawn, not to exceed $25. This fee is intended to reimburse us for the cost 
of processing the withdrawal. The transaction fee applies to all partial        
withdrawals, including a Withdrawal without a surrender charge (described       
below).                                                                         

A partial withdrawal charge may also be deducted from policy value. However, in 
any Policy year, you may withdraw, without a partial withdrawal charge, up to:  

-    10% of the policy value MINUS                                    
     -    The total of any prior free withdrawals in the same Policy year ("Free
10% Withdrawal")                                            

The right to make the Free 10% Withdrawal is not cumulative from Policy year to 
Policy year. For example, if only 8% of policy value were withdrawn in the      
second Policy year, the amount you could withdraw in future Policy years would  
not be increased by the amount you did not withdraw in the second Policy year.  

We impose the partial withdrawal charge on any withdrawal greater than the Free 
10% Withdrawal. The charge is 5.0% of the excess withdrawal up to the surrender 
charge. If no surrender charge applies on withdrawal, no partial withdrawal     
charge will apply. We will reduce the Policy's outstanding surrender charge by  
the partial withdrawal charge deducted, proportionately reducing the deferred   
sales and administrative charges. The partial withdrawal charge deducted will   
decrease existing surrender charges in inverse order.                           

WHAT ARE THE TRANSFER CHARGES?                                                  

Currently, the first 12 transfers in a Policy year are free. We reserve the     
right to limit the number of free transfers in a Policy year to six. After that,
we will deduct a $10 transfer charge from amounts transferred in that Policy    
year. We reserve the right to increase the charge, but it will never exceed $25.
This charge reimburses us for the administrative                                

P-->485APOS38th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
costs of processing the transfer.                                               

If you apply for automatic transfers, the first automatic transfer counts as one
transfer. Each future automatic transfer is without charge and does not reduce  
the remaining number of transfers that may be made without charge.              

Each of the following transfers of policy value from the sub-accounts to the    
fixed account is free and does not count as one of the 12 free transfers in a   
Policy year:                                                                    

     -    A conversion within the first 24 months from date of issue or increase
-    A transfer to the fixed account to secure a loan                 

A reallocation of policy value within 20 days of the date of issue              

WHAT IS THE CHARGE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE FACE AMOUNT?                          

For each increase in the Face Amount you request, a transaction charge of $50   
will be deducted from Policy Value to reimburse the Company for administrative  
costs associated with the increase. This charge is guaranteed not to increase   
and the Company does not expect to make a profit on this charge.                

ARE THERE ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES?                                     

We reserve the right to charge for other administrative costs we incur. While   
there are no current charges for these costs, we may impose a charge for:       

-    Changing net payment allocation instructions                     
    -    Changing the allocation of monthly insurance protection charges among
the various sub-accounts and the fixed account              
-    Providing a projection of values                                 

We do not currently charge for these costs. Any future charge is guaranteed not 
to exceed $25 per transaction.                                                  

DOES THE COMPANY WAIVE CHARGES FOR ANY CLASSES OF POLICYOWNERS?                 

No surrender charges, partial withdrawal charges or front-end sales loads are   
imposed, and no commissions are paid where the Policy owner as of the date of   
application is within the following class of individuals:                       

  All employees of the First Allmerica and its affiliates and subsidiaries
    located at First Allmerica's home office (or at off-site locations if such
     employees are on First Allmerica's home office payroll); directors of First
     Allmerica and its affiliates and subsidiaries; all employees and registered
representatives of any broker-dealer that has entered into a sales    
    agreement with us or VeraVest, Inc. (formerly Allmerica Investments, Inc.)
   to sell the Policies and any spouses of the above persons or any children
of the above persons.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The effect of federal income taxes on the value of the Policy, on loans,        
withdrawals, or surrenders, on death benefit payments, and on the economic      
benefit to you or the Beneficiary depends upon a variety of factors. The        
following discussion is based upon the Company's understanding of the present   
federal income tax laws as they currently are interpreted. From time to time    
legislation is proposed which, if passed, could significantly, adversely and    
possibly retroactively affect the taxation of the Policy. No representation is  
made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws
or of current interpretations by the IRS. Moreover, no attempt has been made to 
consider any applicable state or other tax laws. It should be recognized that   
the following summary of federal income tax aspects of amounts received under   
the Policy is not exhaustive, does not purport to cover all situations, and is  
not intended as tax advice. Specifically, the discussion below does not address 
certain tax provisions that may be applicable if the Policyowner is a           
corporation or the Trustee of an employee benefit plan. A qualified tax adviser 
always should be consulted with regard to the application of law to individual  
circumstances.                                                                  

HOW ARE THE COMPANY AND THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT TAXED?                             
The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under Subchapter L of the Code 
and files a consolidated tax return with its parent and affiliates. The Company 
does not expect to incur any income tax upon the earnings or realized capital   
gains attributable to the Variable Account. Based on this, no charge is made for
federal income taxes which may be attributable to the Variable Account.         

Periodically, the Company will review the question of a charge to the Variable  
Account for federal income taxes. Such a charge may be made in future years for 
any federal income taxes incurred by the Company. This might become necessary if
the tax treatment of the Company ultimately is determined to be other than what 
the Company believes it to be, if there are changes made in the federal income  
tax treatment of variable life insurance at the Company level, or if there is a 
change in the Company's tax status. Any such charge would be designed to cover  
the federal income taxes attributable to the investment results of the Variable 
Account.                                                                        

Under current laws the Company also may incur state and local taxes (in addition
to premium taxes) in several states. At present these taxes are not significant.
If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, charges may
be made for such taxes paid, or reserves for such taxes, attributable to the    
Variable Account.                                                               

HOW ARE THE POLICIES TAXED?                                                     
The Company believes that the Policy described in this Prospectus will be       
considered a life insurance contract under Section 7702 of the Code, which      
generally provides for the taxation of life insurance policies and places       
limitations on premiums and the relationship of the Policy Value to the         
Insurance Amount at Risk. As a result, the Death Proceeds payable are excludable
from the gross income of the Beneficiary. Moreover, any increase in the Policy  
Value is not taxable until received by the Policyowner or the Policyowner's     
designee. However, if a Policy fails to qualify as life insurance under Section 
7702, the Policy will not provide most of the tax advantages normally provided  
by life insurance. The Company reserves the right to amend the Policies to      
comply with any future changes in the Code, any regulations or rulings under the
Code and any other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. WHAT   
ARE MODIFIED ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY TAXED?, below.                 

Depending upon the circumstances, a surrender, partial withdrawal, change in the
Sum Insured Option, change in the Face Amount, lapse with Policy loan           
outstanding or assignment of the Policy may have tax consequences. In           
particular, under specified conditions, a distribution under the Policy during  
the first 15 years from Date of Issue that reduces future benefits under the    
Policy will be taxed to the Policyowner as ordinary income to the extent of any 
investment earnings in the Policy. Federal, state and local income, estate,     
inheritance, and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of Policy       
proceeds depend on the circumstances of each Insured, Policyowner or            
Beneficiary.                                                                    

If you surrender the Policy, you are subject to income tax on the portion of the
distribution that exceeds the investment in the contract. The investment in the 
contract is the gross Premiums paid for the Policy minus any amounts previously 
received from the Policy if such amounts were properly excluded from your gross 
income. Policy loans are generally not treated as taxable distributions.        
Interest paid on a Policy loan is generally not deductible. You are generally   
taxed on partial withdrawals to the extent the                                  

P-->485APOS40th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
amount distributed exceeds the investment in the contract. In certain           
situations, partial withdrawals or reduction in benefits during the first       
fifteen years of the Policy may result in a taxable distribution before the     
investment in the contract is recovered. Withdrawals and loans from modified    
endowment contracts are subject to less favorable tax treatment. For an         
additional discussion of modified endowment contracts, please see WHAT ARE      
MODIFIED ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY TAXED?, below.                     

If the Death Benefit is not received in a lump sum but is instead applied under 
one of the settlement options, payments generally will be prorated between      
amounts attributable to the Death Benefit, which will be excludable from the    
Beneficiary's income, and amounts attributable to interest (occurring after the 
Insured's death), which will be includable in the Beneficiary's income.         

If you are Owner and Insured under the Policy, the Death Benefit will be        
included in your gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Even if the      
Insured is not the Owner but retains incidents of ownership in the Policy, the  
Death Benefit will also be included in the Insured's gross estate. Examples of  
incidents of ownership include the right to:                                    

-    change beneficiaries,                                            
-    assign the Policy,                                               
-    revoke an assignment,                                            
-    pledge the Policy, or                                            
-    obtain a Policy loan.                                            

If you are Owner and Insured under the Policy, and you transfer all incidents of
ownership in the Policy, the Death Benefit will be included in your gross estate
if you die within three years from the date of the ownership transfer. State and
local estate and inheritance taxes may also apply. In addition, certain         
transfers of the Policy or Death Benefit, either during life or at death, to    
individuals two or more generations below the transferor may be subject to the  
federal generation skipping transfer tax. This rule also applies if the transfer
is to a trust for the benefit of individuals two or more generations below the  
transferor.                                                                     

The Policy may be used in various arrangements, including nonqualified deferred 
compensation or salary continuance plans, split dollar insurance plans,         
executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax        
consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and       
circumstances of each individual arrangement. If you are contemplating the use  
of a Policy in any of these arrangements, you should consult a qualified tax    
adviser regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.             

HOW ARE POLICY LOANS TAXED?                                                     
The Company believes that non-preferred loans received under the Policy will be 
treated as an indebtedness of the Policyowner for federal income tax purposes.  
Under current law, these loans will not constitute income for the Policyowner   
while the Policy is in force (but see "Modified Endowment Policies"). There is a
risk, however, that a preferred loan may be characterized by the IRS as a       
withdrawal and taxed accordingly. At the present time, the IRS has not issued   
any guidance on whether loans with the attributes of a preferred loan should be 
treated differently than a non-preferred loan. This lack of specific guidance   
makes the tax treatment of preferred loans uncertain. In the event pertinent IRS
guidelines are issued in the future, you may convert your preferred loan to a   
non-preferred loan. However, it is possible that, notwithstanding the           
conversion, some or all of the loan could be treated as a taxable distribution  
from the Policy.                                                                

Section 264 of the Code restricts the deduction of interest on Policy loans.    
Consumer interest paid on Policy loans under an individually owned Policy is not
tax deductible. No tax deduction for interest is allowed on Policy loans        
exceeding $50,000 in the aggregate, if the Insured is an officer or employee of,
or is financially interested in, any business carried on by the taxpayer. There 
is an exception to this rule which permits a deduction for interest on loans up 
to $50,000 related to any business-owned policies covering officers or          
20-percent owners, up to a maximum equal to the greater of (1) five individuals,
or (2) the lesser of (a) 5% of the total number of officers and employees of the
corporation, or (b) 20 individuals.                                             

POLICIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS 

The Policies may be issued in connection with tax-sheltered annuity plans ("TSA 
Plans") of certain public school                                                

P-->485APOS41st�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
systems and organizations that are tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the    
Code.                                                                           

Under the provisions of Section 403(b) of the Code, payments made for annuity   
policies purchased for employees under TSA Plans are excludable from the gross  
income of such employees, to the extent that the aggregate purchase payments in 
any year do not exceed the maximum contribution permitted under the Code. The   
Company has received a Private Letter Ruling with respect to the status of the  
Policies as providing "incidental life insurance" when issued in connection with
TSA Plans. In the Private Letter Ruling, the IRS has taken the position that the
purchase of a life insurance Policy by the employer as part of a TSA Plan will  
not violate the "incidental benefit" rules of Section 403(b) and the regulations
thereunder. The Private Letter Ruling also stated that the use of current or    
accumulated contributions to purchase a life insurance Policy will not result in
current taxation of the premium payments for the life insurance Policy, except  
for the current cost of the life insurance protection.                          

A Policy qualifying under Section 403(b) of the Code must provide that          
withdrawals or other distributions attributable to salary reduction             
contributions (including earnings) may not begin before the employee attains age
59 1/2, separates from service, dies, or becomes disabled. In the case of       
hardship, a Policyowner may withdraw amounts contributed by salary reduction,   
but not the earnings on such amounts. Even though a distribution may be         
permitted under these rules (e.g., for hardship or after separation from        
service), it may nonetheless be subject to a 10% penalty tax as a premature     
distribution, in addition to income tax.                                        

Policy loans are generally permitted in accordance with the terms of the Policy.
However, if a Policy loan does not comply with the requirements of Code Section 
72(p), the Policyowner's TSA plan may become disqualified and Policy values may 
be includible in current income.                                                

WHAT ARE MODIFIED ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY TAXED?                    

The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 ("the 1988 Act") adversely  
affects the tax treatment of distributions under so-called "modified endowment  
contracts." A life insurance policy is treated as a modified endowment contract 
under Section 7702A of the Code if it meets the definition of life inusrance in 
Section 7702, but tfails the "seven-pay test" of Section 7702A.. The Policy     
would fail to satisfy the seven-pay test if the cumulative premiums paid under  
the Policy at any time during the first seven Policy years (or within seven     
years of a material change in the Policy) exceed the sum of the net level       
premiums that would have been paid, had the Policy provided for paid-up future  
benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums. In addition, if      
benefits are reduced at anytime during the life of the Policy, there may be     
adverse tax consequences. Please consult your tax adviser.                      

If the Policy is considered a modified endowment contract, the Death Benefit    
will still qualify for the exclusion from gross income, and increases in Policyt
value are not subject to current taxation unless withdrawn or otherwise         
accessed. However, all distributions under the Policy will be taxed on an       
"income-first" basis. Most distributions received by the Policyowner directly or
indirectly (including loans, withdrawals, surrenders, or the assignment or      
pledge of any portion of the Policy Value) will be includible in gross income to
the extent that the cash Surrender Value of the Policy exceeds the Policyowner's
investment in the Policy. Any additional amounts will be treated as a return of 
capital to the extent of the Policyowner's basis in the Policy. With certain    
exceptions, an additional 10% tax will be imposed on the portion of any         
distribution that is includible in income. All modified endowment contracts     
issued by the same insurance company to the same Policyowner during any calendar
period will be treated as a single modified endowment contract in determining   
taxable distributions.                                                          

Currently, each Policy is reviewed when premiums are received to determine if it
satisfies the seven-pay test. If the Policy does not satisfy the seven-pay test,
the Company will notify the Policyowner of the option of requesting a refund of 
the excess premium. The refund process must be completed within 60 days after   
the Policy anniversary, or the Policy will be classified permanently as a       
modified endowment contract.                                                    

WHAT ARE THE DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT?             

The Code also requires that the investment of each Sub-Account be adequately    
diversified in accordance with Treasury regulations in order to be treated as a 
life insurance Policy for tax purposes. Although the Company does not have      
control over the investments of the Funds, the Company believes that the Funds  
currently meet the Treasury's diversification requirements, and the Company will
monitor continued compliance with these requirements. In connection with the    
issuance of previous regulations relating to diversification requirements, the  
Treasury Department                                                             

P-->485APOS42nd�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
announced that such regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to
which Policyowners may direct their investments to particular divisions of a    
separate account. Regulations in this regard may be issued in the future. It is 
possible that if and when regulations are issued, the Policy may need to be     
modified to comply with such regulations. For these reasons, the Policy or the  
Company's administrative rules may be modified as necessary to prevent a        
Policyowner from being considered the owner of the assets of the Variable       
Account.                                                                        

CAN I BE CONSIDERED THE OWNER OF THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT ASSETS FOR TAX PURPOSES?  

The IRS has stated that you will be considered the owner of Variable Account    
assets if you possess incidents of ownership in those assets, such as the       
ability to exercise investment control over the assets. At the time the         
diversification regulations were issued, the Treasury Department announced that 
the regulations do not provide guidance concerning circumstances in which       
investor control of the Variable Account investments may cause an investor to be
treated as the owner of the Variable Account. The Treasury Department also      
stated that future guidance would be issued regarding the extent that owners    
could direct Sub-Account investments without being treated as owners of the     
underlying assets of the Variable Account.                                      

Your rights under this Policy are different than those described by the IRS in  
rulings in which it found that contract owners were not owners of Variable      
Account assets. For example, you have the choice to allocate Premiums and Policy
Values among more investment options. In addition, you may be able to transfer  
among investment options more frequently than in such rulings. These differences
could result in you being treated as the owner of the Variable Account. If this 
occurs, income and gain from the Variable Account assets would be includible in 
your gross income. The Company does not know what standards will be set forth in
any regulations or rulings that the Treasury Department may issue. It is        
possible that future standards announced by the Treasury Department could       
adversely affect the tax treatment of your contract. We reserve the right to    
modify the Policy as necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered  
the federal tax owner of the assets of the Variable Account. However we make no 
guarantee that such modification to the Policy will be successful.              

 OTHER INFORMATION
ARE THERE OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY PROVISIONS?                                    

The following Policy provisions may vary in certain states in order to comply   
with requirements of the insurance laws, regulations and insurance regulatory   
agencies in those states.                                                       

POLICYOWNER                                                                     

The Policyowner is the Insured unless another Policyowner has been named in the 
application for the Policy. The Policyowner generally is entitled to exercise   
all rights under the Policy while the Insured is alive, subject to the consent  
of any irrevocable Beneficiary (the consent of a revocable Beneficiary is not   
required). The consent of the Insured is required whenever the Face Amount of   
insurance is increased.                                                         

BENEFICIARY                                                                     

The Beneficiary is the person or persons to whom the insurance proceeds are     
payable upon the Insured's death. Unless otherwise stated in the Policy, the    
Beneficiary has no rights in the Policy before the death of the Insured. While  
the Insured is alive, you may change any Beneficiary unless you have declared a 
Beneficiary to be irrevocable. If no Beneficiary is alive when the Insured dies,
the Policyowner (or the Policyowner's estate) will be the Beneficiary. If more  
than one Beneficiary is alive when the Insured dies, they will be paid in equal 
shares, unless you have chosen otherwise. Where there is more than one          
Beneficiary, the interest of a Beneficiary who dies before the Insured will pass
to surviving Beneficiaries proportionally, unless otherwise requested.          

INCONTESTABILITY                                                                
The Company will not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in    
force during the Insured's lifetime for two years from the Date of Issue. The   
Company will not contest the validity of any increase in the Face Amount after  
such increase or rider has been in force during the Insured's lifetime for two  
years from its effective date.                                                  

SUICIDE                                                                         

The Death Proceeds will not be paid if the Insured commits suicide, while sane  
or insane, within two years from the Date of Issue. Instead, the Company will   
pay the Beneficiary an amount equal to all premiums paid for the Policy,        

P-->485APOS43rd�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
without interest, and less any outstanding Debt and any partial withdrawals. If 
the Insured commits suicide, while sane or insane, generally within two years   
from the effective date of any increase in the Sum Insured, the Company's       
liability with respect to such increase will be limited to a refund of the cost 
thereof. The Beneficiary will receive the administrative charges and insurance  
charges paid for such increase.                                                 

AGE AND SEX                                                                     

If the Insured's Age or sex as stated in the application for the Policy is not  
correct, benefits under the Policy will be adjusted to reflect the correct Age  
and sex, if death occurs prior to the Final Premium Payment Date. The adjusted  
benefit will be that which the most recent cost of insurance charge would have  
purchased for the correct Age and sex. In no event will the Sum Insured be      
reduced to less than the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured. In the case of a Policy 
issued on a unisex basis, this provision as it relates to misstatement of sex   
does not apply.                                                                 

ASSIGNMENT                                                                      

The Policyowner may assign the Policy as collateral or make an absolute         
assignment of the Policy. All rights under the Policy will be transferred to the
extent of the assignee's interest. The consent of the assignee may be required  
in order to make changes in premium allocations, to make transfers, or to       
exercise other rights under the Policy. The Company is not bound by an          
assignment or release thereof, unless it is in writing and is recorded at the   
Principal Office. When recorded, the assignment will take effect as of the date 
the Written Request was signed. Any rights created by the assignment will be    
subject to any payments made or actions taken by the Company before the         
assignment is recorded. The Company is not responsible for determining the      
validity of any assignment or release.                                          

CAN THE COMPANY DELAY PAYMENTS TO ME?                                           

Payments of any amount due from the Variable Account upon surrender, partial    
withdrawals, or death of the Insured, as well as payments of a Policy loan and  
transfers, may be postponed whenever: (1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed 
other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or trading on the New York   
Stock Exchange is restricted as determined by the SEC or (2) an emergency       
exists, as determined by the SEC, as a result of which disposal of securities is
not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to determine the 
value of the Variable Account's net assets. Payments under the Policy of any    
amounts derived from the premiums paid by check may be delayed until such time  
as the check has cleared your bank.                                             

The Company also reserves the right to defer payment of any amount due from the 
General Account upon surrender, partial withdrawal or death of the Insured, as  
well as payments of Policy loans and transfers from the General Account, for a  
period not to exceed six months.                                                

DO I HAVE ANY VOTING RIGHTS?                                                    

To the extent required by law, the Company will vote Underlying Fund shares held
by each Sub-Account in accordance with instructions received from Policyowners  
with Policy Value in such Sub-Account. If the 1940 Act or any rules thereunder  
should be amended, or if the present interpretation of the 1940 Act or such     
rules should change and, as a result the Company determines that it is permitted
to vote shares in its own right, whether or not such shares are attributable to 
the Policy, the Company reserves the right to do so.                            

Each person having a voting interest will be provided with proxy materials of   
the respective Underlying Fund, together with an appropriate form with which to 
give voting instructions to the Company. Shares held in each Sub-Account for    
which no timely instructions are received will be voted in proportion to the    
instructions which have been received by the Company. The Company also will vote
shares held in the Variable Account that it owns and which are not attributable 
to the Policy in the same proportion.                                           

The number of votes which a Policyowner has the right to instruct will be       
determined by the Company as of the record date established for the Underlying  
Fund. This number is determined by dividing each Policyowner's Policy Value in  
the Sub-Account, if any, by the net asset value of one share in the             
corresponding Underlying Fund in which the assets of the Sub-Account are        
invested.                                                                       

We may, when required by state insurance regulatory authorities, disregard      
voting instructions if the instructions require that the Fund shares be voted so
as (1) to cause a change in the sub-classification or investment objective of   
one or more                                                                     

P-->485APOS44th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
of the Funds, or (2) to approve or disapprove an investment advisory contract   
for the Funds. In addition, the Company may disregard voting instructions that  
are in favor of any change in the investment policies or in any investment      
adviser or principal underwriter if the change has been initiated by            
Policyowners or the Trustees. Our disapproval of any such change must be        
reasonable and, in the case of a change in investment policies or investment    
adviser, based on a good faith determination that such change would be contrary 
to state law or otherwise is inappropriate in light of the objectives and       
purposes of the Funds. In the event we do disregard voting instructions, a      
summary of and the reasons for that action will be included in the next periodic
report to Policyowners.                                                         

WHAT REPORTS WILL I RECEIVE CONCERNING MY POLICY?                               
The Company will maintain the records relating to the Variable Account.         
Statements of significant transactions such as premium payments, changes in     
specified Face Amount, changes in Sum Insured Option, transfers among           
Sub-Accounts and the General Account, partial withdrawals, increases in loan    
amount by you, loan repayments, lapse, termination for any reason, and          
reinstatement will be sent to you promptly. An annual statement also will be    
sent to you within 30 days after a Policy anniversary. The annual statement will
summarize all of the above transactions and deductions of charges during the    
Policy year. It also will set forth the status of the Death Proceeds, Policy    
Value, Surrender Value, amounts in the Sub-Accounts and General Account, and any
Policy loan(s). The Owner should review the information in all statements       
carefully. All errors or corrections must be reported to the Company immediately
to assure proper crediting to the Contract. The Company will assume that all    
transactions are accurately reported on confirmation statements and             
quarterly/annual statements unless the Owner notifies the Principal Office in   
writing within 30 days after receipt of the statement. In addition, you will be 
sent periodic reports containing financial statements and other information for 
the Variable Account and the Underlying Funds as required by the 1940 Act.      

ARE THERE ANY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT?         

There are no legal proceedings pending to which the Variable Account is a party,
or to which the assets of the Variable Account are subject. The Company and     
Allmerica Investments, Inc. are not involved in any litigation that is of       
material importance in relation to their total assets or that relates to the    
Variable Account.                                                               

MAY THE COMPANY ADD, DELETE OR SUBSTITUTE FUNDS?                                
The Company reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to,
deletions from, or substitutions for the shares that are held in the            
Sub-Accounts or that the Sub-Accounts may purchase. If the shares of any        
Underlying Fund are no longer available for investment or if in the Company's   
judgment further investment in any Underlying Fund should become inappropriate  
in view of the purposes of the Variable Account or the affected Sub-Account, the
Company may redeem the shares of that Underlying Fund and substitute shares of  
another registered open-end management company. The Company will not substitute 
any shares attributable to a Policy interest in a Sub-Account without notice to 
the Policyowner and prior approval of the SEC and state insurance authorities,  
to the extent required by law. The Variable Account may, to the extent permitted
by law, purchase other securities for other policies or permit a conversion     
between policies upon request by a Policyowner.                                 

The Company also reserves the right to establish additional Sub-Accounts of the 
Variable Account, each of which would invest in shares of a new Underlying Fund 
or in shares of another investment company. Subject to applicable law and any   
required SEC approval, the Company may, in its sole discretion, establish new   
Sub-Accounts or eliminate one or more Sub-Accounts if marketing needs, tax      
considerations or investment conditions warrant. Any new Sub-Accounts may be    
made available to existing Policyowners on a basis to be determined by the      
Company.                                                                        

If any of these substitutions or changes are made, the Company may endorse the  
Policy to reflect the substitution or change, and will notify Policyowners of   
all such changes. If the Company deems it to be in the best interest of         
Policyowners, and subject to any approvals that may be required under applicable
law, the Variable Account or any Sub-Account(s) may be operated as a management 
company under the 1940 Act, may be deregistered under the 1940 Act if           
registration is no longer required, or may be combined with other Sub-Accounts  
or other separate accounts of the Company.                                      

WHAT IS MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING?                                               

P-->485APOS45th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
Shares of the Funds of the Trust also are issued to separate accounts of the    
Company and its affiliates which issue variable annuity contracts ("mixed       
funding"). Shares of the portfolios of the Underlying Funds also are issued to  
other unaffiliated insurance companies ("shared funding"). It is conceivable    
that in the future such mixed funding or shared funding may be disadvantageous  
for variable life Policyowners or variable annuity contract owners. Although the
Company and the Underlying Investment Companies currently do not foresee any    
such disadvantages to either variable life insurance Policyowners or variable   
annuity contract owners, the Company and the respective Trustees intend to      
monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts and to determine what
action, if any, should be taken. If the Trustees were to conclude that separate 
Funds should be established for variable life and variable annuity separate     
accounts, the Company will bear the expenses.                                   

WHO ARE THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS OF THE COMPANY?                             

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.                                                     

The financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, and the financial
statements of Allmerica Select Separate account II Account of the Company as of 
December 31, 2002 and for the periods indicated, included in this Prospectus    
constituting part of this Registration Statement, have been so included in      
reliance on the reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, 
given on the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting.      

The financial statements of the Company included herein should be considered    
only as bearing on the ability of the Company to meet its obligations under the 
Policy.                                                                         

WHERE CAN I FIND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE VARIABLE       
ACCOUNT?                                                                        

Financial Statements for the Company and for the Variable Account are included  
in the Statement of Additional Information. The financial statements of the     
Company should be considered only as a bearing on our ability to meet our       
obligations under the Policy. They should not be considered as a bearing on the 
investment performance of the assets held in the Variable Account.              

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNT

This Prospectus serves as a disclosure document only for the aspects of the     
Policy relating to the variable account. For complete details on the fixed      
account, read the Policy itself. The fixed account and other interests in the   
general account are not regulated under the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act because of 
exemption and exclusionary provisions. The 1933 Act provisions on the accuracy  
and completeness of statements made in prospectuses may apply to information on 
the fixed part of the Policy and the fixed account. The SEC has not reviewed the
disclosures in this section of the Prospectus.                                  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                             

You may allocate part or all of your net payments to accumulate at a fixed rate 
of interest in the Fixed Account. The Fixed Account is a part of our general    
account. The general account is made up of all of our general assets other than 
those allocated to any separate account. Allocations to the Fixed Account become
part of our general account assets and are used to support insurance and annuity
obligations.                                                                    

FIXED ACCOUNT INTEREST                                                          

We guarantee amounts allocated to the Fixed Account as to principal and a       
minimum rate of interest. We will credit amounts allocated to the Fixed Account 
with interest at an effective annual yield of at least 4.0%, compounded daily.  
"Excess interest" may or may not be credited at our sole discretion. We will    
guarantee initial rates on amounts allocated to the fixed account, either as    
payments or transfers, to the next Policy anniversary. At each Policy           
anniversary, we will credit the then current interest rate to money remaining in
the fixed account. We will guarantee this rate for one year. Thus, if a payment 
has been allocated to the Fixed Account for less than one Policy year, the      
interest rate credited to such payment may be greater or less than the interest 
rate credited to payments that have been allocated to the Policy for more than  
one Policy year.                                                                

Policy loans may also be made from the policy value in the fixed account. We    
will credit that part of the policy value                                       

P-->485APOS46th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
that is equal to any outstanding loan with interest at an effective annual yield
of at least 6.0% (8.0% for preferred loans).                                    

We may delay transfers, surrenders, partial withdrawals, net death benefits and 
Policy loans up to six months. However, if payment is delayed for 30 days or    
more, we will pay interest at least equal to an effective annual yield of 3.0%  
per year for the deferment. Amounts from the fixed account used to make payments
on policies that we or our affiliates issue will not be delayed.                

TRANSFERS, SURRENDERS, AND PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS                                  

If a Policy is surrendered or if a partial withdrawal is made, a surrender      
charge or partial withdrawal charge may be imposed. On a decrease in face       
amount, the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge that would    
apply to a full surrender. We deduct partial withdrawals from policy value      
allocated to the fixed account on a last-in/first-out basis. This means that the
last payments allocated to Fixed Account will be withdrawn first.               

The first 12 transfers in a Policy year currently are free. After that, we will 
deduct a $10 transfer charge for each transfer in that Policy year. The transfer
privilege is subject to our consent and to our then current rules.

   -    The timing and amount of payments are fixed and paid at the start of
the Policy year                                             

  -    Monthly insurance protection charges are based on the Commissioners

GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED: the minimum death benefit required to qualify the

-    A percentage based on the Insured's age

determines the minimum death benefit required under federal tax laws. For both  
the Level Option and the Adjustable Option, the percentage factor is based on   

P-->485APOS48th�Page�of�84TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
the Insured's attained age, as set forth in APPENDIX A -GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM   
INSURED TABLE.

processing date from the Date of Issue or increase in Face Amount, within       
limits.

NET DEATH BENEFIT: Before the Final Payment Date, the net death benefit is:

MINUS                                                       

   -    Any outstanding loan on the Insured's death and partial withdrawals,
  partial withdrawal costs, and due and unpaid monthly insurance
protection charges.                                         

Where permitted by state law, we will compute the Net Death Benefit on the date 
we receive due proof of the Insured's death under the Adjustable Option and on

Date, the death benefit is the greater of:

 GENERAL INFORMATION AND HISTORY

First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company ("First Allmerica"), originally
organized under the laws of Massachusetts in 1844, is among the five oldest life
insurance companies in America. Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity  
Company ("Allmerica Financial") is a life insurance company organized under the 
laws of Delaware in July 1974. Prior to December 31, 2002, First Allmerica was  
the immediate parent of Allmerica Financial and a direct subsidiary of Allmerica
Financial Corporation ("AFC"). Effective December 31, 2002, Allmerica Financial 
became a Massachusetts domiciled insurance company and a direct wholly-owned    
subsidiary of AFC, while First Allmerica became a wholly-owned subsidiary of    
Allmerica Financial (and thereby became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of  
AFC). Allmerica Financial and First Allmerica are referred to collectively as   
the " Company." Their principal office is located at 440 Lincoln Street,        
Worcester, MA 01653, telephone 508-855-1000.

"Separate Account." Each meets the definition of "separate account" under       
federal securities laws, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange     
Commission ("SEC") as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act  
of 1940 ("1940 Act"). This registration does not involve SEC supervision of the

Separate Account and the sub-accounts.

 UNDERWRITERS AND DISTRIBUTION

VeraVest Investments, Inc. ("VeraVest"; formerly Allmerica Investments, Inc.), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Allmerica Financial, acts as the principal           
underwriter and general distributor of the Policies. VeraVest is registered with
the SEC as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of       
Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"). VeraVest is located at 440 Lincoln Street,   
Worcester, MA 01653. The Policies were sold by agents of Allmerica Financial who
are registered representatives of VeraVest or of other broker-dealers. The      
Policies are no longer being issued.                                            

We pay to broker-dealers who sell the Policy commissions based on a commission  
schedule. After the date of issue or an increase in Face Amount, commissions    
generally will be 90% of the first-year payments up to a payment amount we      
established and 4% of any excess. Commissions generally will be 2% for          
subsequent payments, plus 0.25% of unloaned Policy value. However, we may pay   
higher commissions under certain circumstances. To the extent permitted by NASD 
rules, overrides and promotional incentives or payments may also be provided to 
General Agents, independent marketing organizations, and broker-dealers based on
sales volumes, the assumption of wholesaling functions or other sales-related   
criteria. Other payments may be made for other services that do not directly    
involve the sale of the Policies. These services may include the recruitment and
training of personnel, production of promotional literature, and similar        
services.                                                                       

We intend to recoup commissions and other sales expenses through:               

-     The front-end sales load                                          

-     The deferred sales charge                                         

-     Investment earnings on amounts allocated under the Policies to the
Fixed Account                                               

Commissions paid on the Policies, including other incentives or payments, are   
not charged to Policy Owners or to the Variable Account.                        

The aggregate amounts of commissions paid to VeraVest for sales of all policies 
funded by the Allmerica Select Separate Account II of Allmerica Financial for   
the years 1999, 2000, and 2001 were $________________, $________________, and   
$________________ . The aggregate amounts of commissions paid to VeraVest for

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS

The Policy provides two death benefit options: the Level Option and Adjustable  
Option. You choose the desired option in the application or enrollment form. You
may change the option once per Policy year by written request. There is no      
charge for a change in option.                                                  

Under the Level Option, the death benefit is the GREATER of the:                

-     Face amount OR                                                      
-     Guideline minimum sum insured                                       

Under the Adjustable Option, the death benefit is the GREATER of the:           

-     Face amount plus policy value OR                                    
-     Guideline minimum sum insured                                       

Under both the Level Option and Adjustable Option, the death benefit provides   
insurance protection. Under the Level Option, the death benefit is level unless 
the guideline minimum sum insured exceeds the face amount; then, the death      
benefit varies as the policy value changes. Under the Adjustable Option, the    
death benefit always varies as the policy value changes.                        

At any face amount, the death benefit will be greater under the Adjustable      
Option than under the Level Option because the policy value is added to the face
amount and included in the death benefit. However, the monthly insurance        
protection charge will be greater. Therefore, policy value will accumulate at a 
slower rate than under the Level Option.                                        

If you desire to have payments and investment performance reflected in the death
benefit, you should choose the Adjustable Option. If you desire to have payments
and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the policy value, 
you should select the Level Option.                                             

GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED                                                   

The Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is a percentage of the policy value as set    
forth in the table below. The Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is computed based on
federal tax regulations to ensure that the Policy qualifies as a life insurance 
contract and that the insurance proceeds will be excluded from the gross income 
of the beneficiary.

ILLUSTRATION OF THE LEVEL OPTION                                                

In this illustration, assume that the Insured is under the age of 40, and that  
there is no outstanding loan.                                                   

Under the Level Option, a Policy with a $100,000 face amount will have a death  
benefit of $100,000. However, because the death benefit must be equal to or     
greater than 250% of policy value, if the policy value exceeds $40,000 the death
benefit will exceed the $100,000 face amount. In this example, each dollar of   
policy value above $40,000 will increase the death benefit by $2.50. For        
example, a Policy with a policy value of $50,000 will have a guideline minimum  
sum insured of $125,000 ($50,000 X 2.50); policy value of $60,000 will produce a
guideline minimum sum insured of $150,000 ($60,000 X 2.50); and policy value of 
$75,000 will produce a guideline minimum sum insured of $187,500 ($75,000 X     
2.50).                                                                          

Similarly, if policy value exceeds $40,000, each dollar taken out of policy     
value will reduce the death benefit by $2.50. If, for example, the policy value 
is reduced from $60,000 to $50,000 because of partial withdrawals, charges or   
negative investment performance, the death benefit will be reduced from $150,000
to $125,000. If, however, the product of the policy value times the applicable  
percentage from the table in APPENDIX A is less than the face amount, the death 
benefit will equal the face amount.                                             

The applicable percentage becomes lower as the Insured's age increases. If the  
Insured's age in the above example were, for example, 50 (rather than between   
zero and 40), the applicable percentage would be 185%. The death benefit would  
not exceed the $100,000 face amount unless the policy value exceeded $54,054    
(rather than $40,000), and each dollar then added to or taken from policy value 
would change the death benefit by $1.85.                                        

ILLUSTRATION OF THE ADJUSTABLE OPTION                                           

In this illustration, assume that the Insured is under the age of 40 and that   
there is no outstanding loan.                                                   

Under the Adjustable Option, a Policy with a face amount of $100,000 will       
produce a death benefit of $100,000 plus policy value. For example, a Policy    
with policy value of $10,000 will produce a death benefit of $110,000 ($100,000 
+ $10,000); policy value of $25,000 will produce a death benefit of $125,000    
($100,000 +$25,000); policy value of $50,000 will produce a death benefit of    
$150,000 ($100,000 + $50,000). However, the death benefit must be at least 250% 
of the policy value. Therefore, if the policy value is greater than $66,667,    
250% of that amount will be the death benefit, which will be greater than the   
face amount plus policy value. In this example, each dollar of policy value     
above $66,667 will increase the death benefit by $2.50. For example, if the     
policy value is $70,000, the guideline minimum sum insured will be $175,000     
($70,000 X 2.50); policy value of $80,000 will produce a guideline minimum sum  
insured of $200,000 ($80,000 X 2.50); and policy value of $90,000 will produce a
guideline minimum sum insured of $225,000 ($90,000 X 2.50).

Similarly, if policy value exceeds $66,667, each dollar taken out of policy     
value will reduce the death benefit by $2.50. If, for example, the policy value 
is reduced from $80,000 to $70,000 because of partial withdrawals, charges or   
negative investment performance, the death benefit will be reduced from $200,000
to $175,000. If, however, the product of the policy value times the applicable  
percentage is less than the face amount plus policy value, then the death       
benefit will be the current face amount plus policy value.                      

The applicable percentage becomes lower as the Insured's age increases. If the  
Insured's age in the above example were 50, the death benefit must be at least  
1.85 times the policy value. The death benefit would be the sum of the policy   
value plus $100,000 unless the policy value exceeded $117,647 (rather than      
$66,667). Each dollar added to or subtracted from the Policy would change the   
death benefit by $1.85.                                                         

CHANGE TO LEVEL OR ADJUSTABLE OPTION                                            

You may change the death benefit option once each Policy year by written        
request. Changing options will not require evidence of insurability. The change 
takes effect on the monthly processing date on or following the date of receipt 
of the written request. We will impose no charge for changes in death benefit   
options.                                                                        

If you change the Level Option to the Adjustable Option, we will decrease the   
face amount to equal:                                                           

-     The death benefit MINUS                                             
-     The policy value on the date of the change                          

The change may not be made if the face amount would fall below $40,000. After   
the change from the Level Option to the Adjustable Option, future monthly       
insurance protection charges may be higher or lower than if no change in option 
had been made. However, the insurance protection amount will always equal the   
face amount unless the guideline minimum sum insured applies.                   

If you change the Adjustable Option to the Level Option, we will increase the   
face amount by the policy value on the date of the change. The death benefit    
will be the GREATER of:                                                         

-    The new face amount or                                             
-    The guideline minimum sum insured                                  

After the change from the Adjustable Option to the Level Option, an increase in 
policy value will reduce the insurance protection amount and the monthly        
insurance protection charge. A decrease in policy value will increase the       
insurance protection amount and the monthly insurance protection charge.        

A change in death benefit option may result in total payments exceeding the then
current maximum payment limitation under federal tax law. If this occurs, we    
will pay the excess to you.                                                     

A change from the Adjustable Death Benefit option to the Level Benefit option   
within five policy years of the Final Payment Date will terminate a Guaranteed  
Death Benefit Rider.

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SURRENDER CHARGES

The Policy's contingent surrender charge is a deferred administrative charge and
a deferred sales charge. The deferred administrative charge is designed to      
reimburse us for the administrative costs of product research and development,  
underwriting, Policy administration and surrendering the Policy. The deferred   
sales charge compensates us for distribution expenses, including commissions to 
our representatives, advertising and the printing of prospectuses and sales     
literature.                                                                     

We compute the surrender charge on date of issue and on any increase in face    
amount. The surrender charge applies for ten years from date of issue or        
increase in face amount. We impose the surrender charge only if, during its     
duration, you request a full surrender or a decrease in face amount.            

The maximum surrender charge includes a:                                        

  -    Deferred administrative charge of $8.50 per thousand dollars of the
initial face amount or increase                             

     -    Deferred sales charge of 28.5% of payments received or associated with
    the increase up to the guideline annual premium for the increase

The maximum surrender charge will not exceed a specified amount per $1,000 of   
initial face amount or increase because of state-imposed limits. The maximum    
surrender charge is level for the first 24 Policy months and then reduces by    
1/96th for the next 96 Policy months, reaching zero at the end of ten Policy    
years.                                                                          

Payments associated with an increase equal that part of the payments made on or 
after the increase that are allocated to the increase. We allocate payments     
based on relative guideline annual premium payments. For example, assume that   
the guideline annual premium is $1,500 before an increase and is $2,000 with the
increase. The policy value on the effective date of the increase would be       
allocated 75% ($1,500/$2,000) to the initial face amount and 25% to the         
increase. All future payments would also be allocated 75% to the initial face   
amount and 25% to the increase.                                                 

If more than one surrender charge is in effect because of one or more increases 
in face amount, we will apply the surrender charges in inverse order. We will   
apply surrender and partial withdrawal charges (described below) in this order: 

-    First, the most recent increase                                  
-    Second, the next most recent increases, and so on                
-    Third, the initial face amount.                                  

A surrender charge may be deducted on a decrease in the face amount. On a       
decrease, the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge that would  
apply to a full surrender. The fraction is the PRODUCT of:                      

-    The decrease DIVIDED by the current face amount TIMES            
-    the surrender charge                                             

Where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial    
face amount, we will deduct a proportionate share of the surrender charge for   
that increase or for the initial face amount.                                   

CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM SURRENDER CHARGES                                        

A separate surrender charge is computed on the date of issue and on each        
increase in face amount. The maximum surrender charge is a:                     

 -    Deferred administrative charge of $8.50 per $1,000 of initial face
amount (or face amount increase) AND                        

-    Deferred sales charge of 28.5% of payments received up to the    
guideline annual premium (GAP)                              

A further limitation is imposed based on the Standard Non-Forfeiture Law of each
state. The maximum surrender charges at the date of issue and on each increase  
in face amount are shown in the table below. During the first two Policy years  
following the date of issue or an increase in face amount, the surrender charge 
may be less than the maximum.

The maximum surrender charge is level for the first 24 Policy months, reduces by
1/96th for the next 96 Policy months, reaching zero at the end of ten Policy

EXAMPLES                                                                        

For the purposes of these examples, assume that a male, Age 35, non-smoker      
purchases a $100,000 Policy. In this example the guideline annual premium       
("GAP") equals $1,014.21. His maximum surrender charge is calculated as follows:

Maximum surrender charge per table (11.39 X 100)                      $1,139.00 

During the first two Policy years after the date of issue, the actual surrender 
charge is the smaller of the maximum surrender charge and the following sum:    

      (1)    Deferred administrative charge                            $850.00
($8.50/$1,000 of Face Amount)                       

      (2)    Deferred sales charge                                      Varies
   (not to exceed 29% of Premiums received, up to one GAP)
                                                               ---------------

                                                            Sum of (1) and (2)

The maximum surrender charge is $1,139.00. All payments are associated with the 
initial face amount unless the face amount is increased.                        

Example 1:                                                                      

Assume the Policy Owner surrenders the Policy in the 10th Policy month, having  
paid total payments of $900. The surrender charge would be $1,106.50.           

Example 2:                                                                      

  Assume          the Policy Owner surrenders the Policy in the 60th month. Also
                  assume that after the 24th Policy month, the maximum surrender
            charge decreases by 1/96 per month thereby reaching zero

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
PRODUCT PERFORMANCE                                                             

The Policies were first offered to the public in 1994 by Allmerica Financial and
in 1999 by First Allmerica. However, we may advertise "Total Return" and        
"Average Annual Total Return" performance information based on the periods that 
the Sub-Accounts have been in existence (Table I and Table III), and based on   
the periods that the Underlying Funds have been in existence (Table II and Table
IV). The results for any period prior to the Policies being offered will be     
calculated as if the Policies had been offered during that period of time, with 
all charges assumed to be those applicable to the Sub-Accounts and the Funds.   

The returns in the tables reflect the charges assessed against the Separate     
Account (e.g., the mortality and expense risk charge and the administration     
charge) and all charges and expenses of the Underlying Funds. However, the      
payment expense charge, the charges that vary with each Policy because they are 
based on certain factors that vary with the individual characteristics of the   
Insured (e.g., the Monthly Deduction and Surrender Charges), and transaction    
charges are not reflected in the rates of return shown below. If these charges  
were deducted, the returns in the Tables would have been significantly lower.   
The tables do not illustrate how investment performance of the underlying funds 
will affect policy values and benefits because they do not reflect deduction of 
all applicable policy charges.                                                  

Total return and average annual total return are based on historical earnings   
and are not intended to indicate future performance. "Total Return" is the total
income generated net of certain expenses and charges. In each table below,      
"One-Year Total Return" refers to the total of the income generated by a        
sub-account, based on certain charges and assumptions as described in the       
respective tables, for the one-year period ended December 31, 2002. "Average    
Annual Total Return" is based on the same charges and assumptions, but reflects 
the hypothetical annually compounded return that would have produced the same   
cumulative return if the Sub-Account's performance had been constant over the   
entire period. Because average annual total returns tend to smooth out          
variations in annual performance return, they are not the same as actual        
year-by-year results.                                                           

Performance information for any sub-account reflects only the performance of a  
hypothetical investment in the sub-account during a period. It is not           
representative of what may be achieved in the future. However, performance      
information may be helpful in reviewing market conditions during a period and in
considering a fund's success in meeting its investment objectives.              

OTHER PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                   

We may compare performance information for a sub-account in reports and         
promotional literature to:                                                      

-    Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P 500")    
-    Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA")                            
-    Shearson Lehman Aggregate Bond Index                             
 -    Other unmanaged indices of unmanaged securities widely regarded by
investors as representative of the securities markets       
  -    Other groups of variable life separate accounts or other investment
products tracked by Lipper Inc.                             
-    Other services, companies, publications, or persons such as      
         Morningstar, Inc., who rank the investment products on performance or
other criteria                                              
-    The Consumer Price Index                                         

Unmanaged indices may assume the reinvestment of dividends but generally do not 
reflect deductions for insurance and administrative charges, separate account   
charges and fund management costs and expenses.                                 

In advertising, sales literature, publications or other materials, we may give  
information on various topics of interest to Policy owners and prospective      
Policy owners. These topics may include:                                        

   -    The relationship between sectors of the economy and the economy as a
  whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment
      strategies and techniques (such as value investing, market timing,
 dollar cost averaging, asset allocation and automatic account
rebalancing)                                                
-    The advantages and disadvantages of investing in tax-deferred and
taxable investments                                         
  -    Customer profiles and hypothetical payment and investment scenarios

-    Financial management and tax and retirement planning             
     -    Investment alternatives to certificates of deposit and other financial
   instruments, including comparisons between the Policies and the
characteristics of and market for the financial instruments.

At times, the Company may also advertise the ratings and other information      
assigned to it by independent rating organizations such as A.M. Best Company    
("A.M. Best"), Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's"), Standard & Poor's         
Insurance Rating Services ("S&P") and Duff & Phelps. A.M. Best's and Moody's    
ratings reflect their current opinion of the Company's relative financial       
strength and operating performance in comparison to the norms of the life/heath 
insurance industry. S&P's and Duff & Phelps' ratings measure the ability of an  
insurance company to meet its obligations under insurance policies it issues do 
not measure the ability of such companies to meet other non-policy obligations. 
The ratings also do not relate to the performance of the Underlying Funds.

 TABLE I
ALLMERICA FINANCIAL LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY COMPANY
 SUPPLEMENTAL AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS
FOR PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002
SINCE INCEPTION OF THE SUB-ACCOUNT

The following performance information is based on the periods that the          
Sub-Accounts have been in existence. The performance information is net of total
Underlying Fund expenses and all Sub-Account charges. THE DATA DOES NOT REFLECT 
THE PREMIUM EXPENSE CHARGE, MONTHLY CHARGES UNDER THE POLICY, SURRENDER CHARGES,
OR TRANSACTION CHARGES. IF THESE CHARGES WERE DEDUCTED, PERFORMANCE WOULD HAVE  
BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE TABLE BELOW. It is assumed that an annual       
premium payment of $3,000 (approximately one Guideline Annual Premium) was made 
at the beginning of each Policy year and that ALL premiums were allocated to    
EACH Sub-Account individually.

(1)  Many of the Underlying Funds in which the Sub-Accounts invest existed prior
to the date the Sub-Accounts commenced operations. In this table, the 
 specified period is based on the inception date of each Underlying Fund
rather than the inception date of the Sub-Account. As such, the table 
 represents what the performance of a Sub-Account would have been if the
  Sub-Account had been both in existence and invested in the corresponding
  Underlying Fund since the date indicated. In that respect, these numbers
are hypothetical and are not the actual performance numbers for the   
Sub-Accounts or the Contract.                                         

*    These funds include a charge for 12b-1 fees. For periods beyond the        
    inception date of the Sub-Accounts, these hypothetical performance figures
     are based upon the historical performance of the non 12b-1 class of shares,
but adjusted to reflect the effect of the 12b-1 fee on performance.   

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION REFLECTS ONLY THE PERFORMANCE OF A HYPOTHETICAL         
INVESTMENT DURING THE PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD ON WHICH THE CALCULATIONS ARE      
BASED. ONE-YEAR TOTAL RETURN AND AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN FIGURES ARE BASED  
ON HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO INDICATE FUTURE PERFORMANCE.     
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTMENT         
OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES, CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO OF THE    
FUND IN WHICH A SUB-ACCOUNT INVESTS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE GIVEN  
TIME PERIOD, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT MAY BE    
ACHIEVED IN THE FUTURE.

(1)  Many of the Underlying Funds in which the Sub-Accounts invest existed prior
to the date the Sub-Accounts commenced operations. In this table, the 
 specified period is based on the inception date of each Underlying Fund
rather than the inception date of the Sub-Account. As such, the table 
 represents what the performance of a Sub-Account would have been if the
  Sub-Account had been both in existence and invested in the corresponding
  Underlying Fund since the date indicated. In that respect, these numbers
are hypothetical and are not the actual performance numbers for the   
Sub-Accounts or the Contract.                                         

*    These funds include a charge for 12b-1 fees. For periods beyond the        
    inception date of the Sub-Accounts, these hypothetical performance figures
     are based upon the historical performance of the non 12b-1 class of shares,
but adjusted to reflect the effect of the 12b-1 fee on performance.   

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION REFLECTS ONLY THE PERFORMANCE OF A HYPOTHETICAL         
INVESTMENT DURING THE PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD ON WHICH THE CALCULATIONS ARE      
BASED. ONE-YEAR TOTAL RETURN AND AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN FIGURES ARE BASED  
ON HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO INDICATE FUTURE PERFORMANCE.     
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTMENT         
OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES, CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITY OF THE PORTFOLIO OF THE    
FUND IN WHICH A SUB-ACCOUNT INVESTS AND THE MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE GIVEN  
TIME PERIOD, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT MAY BE    
ACHIEVED IN THE FUTURE.

ITEM 30. INDEMNIFICATION 

    RULE 484 UNDERTAKING - Article VIII of Registrant's Bylaws provides: "Each
 Director and each Officer of the Corporation, whether or not in office,
   (and his executors or administrators), shall be indemnified or reimbursed
   by the Corporation against all expenses actually and necessarily incurred
by him in the defense or reasonable settlement of any action, suit, or
 proceeding in which he is made a party by reason of his being or having
   been a Director or Officer of the Corporation, including any sums paid in
  settlement or to discharge judgment, except in relation to matters as to
   which he shall be finally adjudged in such action, suit, or proceeding to
    be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duties as
 such Director or Officer; and the foregoing right of indemnification or
     reimbursement shall not affect any other rights to which he may be entitled
     under the Articles of Incorporation, any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders, or otherwise."                                          

    Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the 1933 Act may be
    permitted to Directors, Officers and controlling persons of the Registrant
     pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been
advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
public Policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and is, therefore,         
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
    liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
   or paid by a Director, Officer or controlling person of the Registrant in
  the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such Director, Officer or controlling person in connection with the   
    securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of
     its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
     indemnification by it is against public Policy as expressed in the 1933 Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.         

ITEM 31. PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITERS 

  (A)  VeraVest Investments, Inc. also acts as a principal underwriter for

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

The simplest explanation of an annuity is a scheduled set of payments that exist for a predetermined period of time. The schedule for and amount of the annuity payments will rely largely on your retirement goals and the period of time until you retire.  Once you have made your scheduled payments, or investments, you will be able to begin receiving payments.  These disbursements will serve as your retirement income. 
Many people prefer annuities for retirement because they come in many flexible options and they provide a guaranteed income upon retirement. The main types are:

Immediate -      Allow you to be paid a set amount of money on a predetermined schedule.
Fixed Period Annuities - Are a more conservative option and come with a minimum interest      rate guaranteed.
Equity-Indexed - Give you the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return.
Variable Annuities - The most      flexible annuity and are subject to rises similar to stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

Fixed and Variable Annuities
A fixed annuity is a type of annuity where the issuer, usually a life insurance company, guarantees both the principal and interest rate over the lifetime of the annuity. When an individual purchases fixed annuities, they know exactly how 					much they will be paid back, at what increments, and for how long.
A variable annuity is based upon an investment in a mutual fund that is generally managed by the issuing company.  Just as with a typical mutual 					fund, variable annuities pay according to the performance of the investment and the payments 					are not guaranteed by the company.
There are a few types of annuites that have characteristics of both fixed and variable annuities.   Equity indexed annuities are on example of this. As with a fixed annuity, they provide a guaranteed interest rate of return. However, because they are tied to an equity portfolio like a variable annuity, they may pay a higher rate of return based upon the performance of the fund.
Special Types of Annuities
While all annuities can be classified as "fixed" or "variable," there are many types of annuity products that can fall into either one of these categories. Following is a list of the major types of annuities on the market today.
Qualified and Non-Qualified Annuities
A qualified annuity is simply an annuity that is purchased through a tax-deferred retirement 					account, such as a 401K.  With qualified annuities, the purchaser is able to deduct the premiums from their taxable income at the time of the contribution. Since these are tax deductible, they are frequently referred to as tax sheltered annuities.
A non-qualified annuity just means that it was not purchased via a tax-deferred retirement savings program.  With  					non-qualified annuities, the purchaser receives no tax savings and must also pay tax on any interest income earned upon withdrawal.".
Deferred and Immediate Annuities
With deferred annuities, the purchaser receives no payment at the time the annuity is purchased.  Instead,  					deferred annuities begin to yield payments only after some time period has past, often 					many years.
An immediate annuity includes payments right after the policy is purchased.  In other words, when someone buys 					immediate annuities payments will be issued in the next period after it was purchased, 					usually just a month later.
Lifetime and Fixed Period Annuities
With lifetime annuities, sometimes called  					life annuities, the payout is made to the beneficiary until they die, no matter how long.
With term certain annuities, on the other hand, payouts are only made for a specified period of time and then they stop.  For example,  				 fixed period annuities may specify that payments will be made for exactly 20 years and no 					more, regardless of how long the beneficary lives.
Flexible and Single Premium Annuities
A flexible premium annuities are ones that requires the purchaser to make many payments over 					a period of time.  These are often referred to as multi-payment annuities.
Conversely, single pay annuities are ones that require the purchaser to make a lump sum payment at the beginning.  For example, with  					single premium annuities, the purchaser might be required to invest an initial 					$100,000 all at once and then they would receive payments in return over the specified annuity period.
Additional Annuity Types
There are several less-common types of annuities that are not described above. For your reference, we have included the following topics on these specialized annuity types.

Life Annuities

Annuities and life annuities are plans through which an individual pays a lump sum of money to be invested by the annuity company and payments are sent back to the annuity holder over a set period of time. Life annuities are typically purchased by retirees to maximize yearly income and gain returns on investments without having to manage those investments.
How Life Annuities Work
Annuities can be thought of as loan reversals where the individual pays a large sum of money to a company and the company pays back that loan with interest over a period of time.
Life annuities are defined as plans in which an individual pays a set sum and then receives annual payments over a decided period of time during the individual’s life. Annuities are designed to provide a pre-determined yearly income to the life annuity holder once the annuity has been established. Individuals can either pay into the annuity fund during their working years or pay a large sum from a previously established account once they are close to retirement.
Once purchased, the cost of a life annuity plan is used to purchase stocks, bonds and other investments that typically provide high returns over long periods of time. This accumulated interest is used to help support the life annuity payments. Life annuity interest (interest accumulated on the amount invested in the life annuity) is tax-exempt until payments on the annuity are paid back to the investor. Once the withdraw period begins, the investments are taxed.
Most companies selling life annuities have life annuity plans that have set payments that end as soon as the annuity holder dies. No payments are made to survivors or beneficiaries and any remaining investment is retained by the company. Life annuity payments are usually calculated based on the average lifetime of an individual. If an individual lives beyond this calculated time, then the individual may end up being paid more money than he or she paid into the system. There are, however riders that can be attached to Life annuity plans.
Although typical life annuities will pay the annuity holder until time of death, there are also riders that can be added onto the contract to assure of others receiving the annuities. Some of these options include:

Life with Period certain – payment is received by the individual until death, but with a provision that states that if the individual dies within a certain period of time, the beneficiaries will then receive payments through a predetermined period.
Installment – Refund – guarantees that after death, whatever is left in the annuity fund will be paid to the beneficiaries.
Joint and survivor – in cases of spouses, the annuity pays out beyond the death of the spouse who owns the annuity. The annuity will pay the surviving spouse until death. 

Life annuity plans can be tailored to each individual. Initial payments and total costs of annuities vary as well as the amounts paid out over time. The annual payments back to the annuity holder can vary in both amount of money as well as the frequency (the number of payments in a given period of time). Individuals can decide on how much is paid to them each time or how frequently payments are made, typically they cannot choose both. Once payment options are chosen, however, they cannot be changed. Size of payments depend on:

Total amount of money in the annuity contract
Whether there are minimum required payments
Life expectancy of the individual

Payment into an annuity can happen over period of time or the life annuity can be purchased in on lump sum. Some payment options into a life annuity are:

Single-Premium Annuities – purchase of annuity with one lump sum
Flexible-Premium annuities – purchase of an annuity is made through a series of payments.

Payments from an annuity can also take on variables. Some annuities can defer payment until a later date while others begin payment out immediately. Some payments to the annuity holder can include:

Immediate Annuity – begins payment to the annuity holder immediately after purchase of annuity contract.
Deferred Annuity – payments to the annuity holder begin many years after the contract begins. This can be good for individuals who wish to extend their income far beyond retirement.
Fixed Annuities – The annuity company puts funds into investment and guarantees a certain interest rate over a certain period of time (from months to years)
Variable Annuity – there is no fixed interest rate and more risk in investment with the annuity fund.

Frequency of payments and amount of money in each payment during the payout period can also vary in life annuities. Some options are:

Fixed Amount – gives the annuity holder a fixed amount of income each month chosen by the individual. This payment is constant until the annuity runs out. 
Fixed Period – gives the annuity holder a fixed income over a period of time chosen by the individual. The longer the period, the less payout per period of time.

Fixed Period Annuities

An annuity is a contract purchased with a sum of money to provide the buyer or annuitant with regular payments in return. Annuities work like loans in reverse, in that an individual purchases the annuity for a sum of money (the purchase price) and in return receives annuity payments, which contain interest, over time.
In return, the company pays back the sum of money over a period of time plus some interest. Typically taxes are deferred on annuities until the payments are made to the annuitant.
How Fixed Period Annuities Work
Annuities can vary in amounts paid, frequency of payments, and time periods over which the payments are made. Under some circumstances an individual annuitant can decide either how much is paid in each payment or the period of time over which payments are made. Since the total sum of money is usually decided upon by the amount paid into an annuity, a shorter fixed period annuity would typically have larger payments to the annuitant than a longer fixed period annuity.
If the individual decides on how much is paid to him or her with each payment than larger sums would usually mean a shorter period of payment and a choice of smaller sums would occur over a longer period of time. Some annuities can pay out over the lifetime of the individual.
Fixed period annuities are annuities where the individual annuitant or owner/purchaser of the annuity chooses the amount of time over which the annuity is paid back. Fixed annuities pay a fixed amount over a fixed period of time chosen by the annuitant. The amount of time is usually a function of many years such as ten or fifteen years during which annual, bi-annual, or monthly payments are made to the annuitant. Fixed period annuities are typically sold in the following categories:

5-year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of five years
10-year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of ten years
15-year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of fifteen years
20-year fixed period annuity – level payments are made over a period of twenty years

Fixed period annuities are usually chosen to cover a period of time during which no other benefits or income is earned. For example, a retiree may choose to purchase an annuity that would pay back over a period of time after regular income has ceased but retirement benefits or other benefits have not yet begun. If the annuitant dies before the annuity has finished paying out, the remaining annuity can be transferred to a beneficiary.
