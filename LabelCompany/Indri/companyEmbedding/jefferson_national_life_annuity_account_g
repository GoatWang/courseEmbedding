1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

In the Matter of
INVIVA, INC. and JEFFERSON NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY,
Respondent.


::::::::::::

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, and SECTIONS 9(b) AND 9(f) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Sections 9(b) and  9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") against Inviva, Inc. ("Inviva") and Jefferson National Life Insurance Company ("Jefferson National") (together, "Respondents").
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer of Settlement (the "Offer") which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Order"), as set forth below.  

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offer, the Commission finds that:
Overview
1.	From in or about October 2002 through September 2003, Respondents Inviva, a private New York-based insurance holding company, and Jefferson National, an Inviva subsidiary that issued variable annuities, allowed a group of hedge funds and customers of registered representatives to engage in market timing trading on behalf of Jefferson National variable annuity contract owners. 
2.	In October 2002, Inviva purchased Conseco Variable Life Insurance Company ("CVIC") from Conseco Life Insurance Company of Texas ("Conseco Life"), an affiliate of Conseco, Inc. ("Conseco").  Among other products, CVIC issued the Monument Series Individual and Group Fixed and Variable Annuity ("Monument") and Advantage Plus Fixed and Variable Annuity ("Advantage Plus") products.  Purchasers of the Monument and Advantage Plus products could invest in mutual fund portfolios managed by various fund complexes.  The prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus products indicated that CVIC reserved the right to take steps to prevent detrimental market timing.  In fact, as of the time Inviva purchased CVIC, CVIC had permitted select clients to purchase Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities for the express purpose of market timing certain unaffiliated mutual fund portfolios.  By October 2002, these clients had invested approximately $100 million in Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities.  Ultimately, market timers invested approximately $120 million in the Monument and Advantage Plus products.
3.	After Inviva's purchase of CVIC, Conseco Services, LLC ("Conseco Services"), a Conseco affiliate, continued to provide services pursuant to a transition services agreement through the end of April 2003, and continued to allow market timing throughout the transition period.  During the transition period, Inviva was aware that CVIC customers were engaged in market timing, and Inviva earned the fees that the variable annuity business generated.  In May 2003, Inviva renamed CVIC as Jefferson National, and took over day-to-day management of the business.  The market timing conduct continued.
4.	As had been the case with CVIC's prospectuses, Jefferson National's prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus products reserved Jefferson National's right to take steps  to prevent detrimental market timing.  Inviva, however, permitted hedge funds and brokerage customers, and registered representatives who traded on their behalf, to continue to engage in market timing through Jefferson National variable annuities.  Through their frequent trading, these market timers diluted the value of the underlying mutual funds that were timed.
Respondents
5.	Inviva, a Delaware corporation, is a privately-held holding company.  Inviva is headquartered in New York, New York, with substantial operations in Louisville, Kentucky.  Inviva purchased the stock of CVIC from Conseco Life in October 2002.  Inviva operates primarily through two subsidiary insurance companies, one of which is Jefferson National.
6.	Jefferson National, the former CVIC, is a life insurance company incorporated in Texas.  Jefferson National is licensed to sell insurance products in forty-nine states and the District of Columbia.  Jefferson National is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Inviva.  Jefferson National served as the depositor of Jefferson National Life Annuity Account G and Jefferson National Life Annuity Account H, which are registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts and are the issuers of the Monument and Advantage Plus products, respectively.  Inviva administers Jefferson National's life and annuity products pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement.
Background
A.	Market Timing
7.	Market timing includes (a) frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or (b) buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing.  Market timing, while not illegal per se, can harm other mutual fund shareholders because (a) it can dilute the value of their shares, if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies, (b) it can disrupt the management of the mutual fund's investment portfolio, and (c) it can cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate the market timer's frequent buying and selling of shares.
B.	Variable Annuities
8.	Variable annuities are securities.  Variable annuities are insurance contracts that provide for tax-deferred accumulation during the accumulation period and various payout  options, including a series of payments to be made to a person named as the "annuitant" in the contract.  The payments typically come at the annuitant's retirement.  Hedge funds and others that engage in market timing through variable annuities, however, do not purchase the products in order to obtain the retirement income.  Rather, they purchase variable annuities to be able to market time the underlying mutual fund portfolios.
9.	Assets invested in variable annuities are used to purchase securities, and the size of the payments to the annuitant typically depends on the performance of the underlying securities.  Variable annuity products typically offer access to mutual funds.  Contract owners are able to invest in a variety of mutual funds at several mutual fund complexes through subaccounts of the insurance company that hold shares of the funds.  Funds underlying variable annuity products are offered to insurance company separate accounts and certain tax-qualified retirement plans, but are not sold to the general public.  In some cases, the funds are managed similarly to the corresponding retail funds offered by the fund complex.  The insurance company and mutual fund complexes enter into participation agreements.  In general, the annuity contracts allow the contract owner to place securities orders with the insurance company.  Typically, the variable annuity company combines all buy and sell orders for a particular portfolio, and submits a single net order to the mutual fund complex. 
10.	Insurance companies offer their variable annuity products through prospectuses filed with the Commission.  Among other things, the product prospectuses set out the costs of the annuity, the funds offered, and language concerning executing orders.  The prospectuses may also describe the insurance companies' policies on market timing.  The insurance companies deliver the variable annuity prospectuses to prospective purchasers of variable annuity contracts together with the prospectuses for the various mutual funds available for investment.  The fund prospectuses provide additional information on the particular fund, and may include policies about excessive trading or market timing.
11.	As with market timing of mutual funds, market timing through variable annuities can result in increased expense to, and cause dilution in, the underlying mutual fund portfolios.  Thus, market timing through variable annuities can cause harm not only to other variable annuity purchasers at the insurance company that issued the variable annuities, but also to purchasers at other insurance companies invested in the portfolios being timed.
C.	Inviva Facilitated Market Timing
Inviva acquired CVIC
12.	In October 2002, Inviva purchased the stock of CVIC from Conseco Life.  Inviva then began to make arrangements to take over operation of the variable annuity business.  From October 2002 to April 30, 2003, Conseco Services provided various services to help with the transition of the business pursuant to a services contract.
13.	Throughout the transition period, Inviva offered the Monument and Advantage Plus products under the CVIC name, and received all fees from the sale and maintenance of the variable annuity contracts.  Inviva paid certain administrative fees to Conseco Services for administering the business during that time.  The transition was completed concurrently with Jefferson National's filing with the Commission the May 1, 2003 prospectuses for the Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuity products.
14.	At the time Inviva acquired CVIC, market timing assets constituted the vast majority of assets invested through the Monument product.  Market timing assets continued to dominate the Monument product, both through the transition period and after Inviva assumed full control of the variable annuity business, until September 2003. 
15.	Inviva and Jefferson National continued to allow market timing in the Monument and Advantage Plus products until approximately September 2003.  After the New York Attorney General's office filed its complaint against Canary Capital LLC in September 2003, market timing contract owners surrendered their contracts and withdrew funds constituting a majority of the assets in the Monument product.
The Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses
16.	The Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuity products made available approximately sixty mutual fund portfolios offered by nineteen different fund complexes, none of which were affiliated with Jefferson National.  Significantly, the Monument product had no surrender fee, which permitted the annuity contract owner to redeem the variable annuity at any time without having to pay a penalty.  In contrast, Advantage Plus had a surrender fee that decreased over time.
17.	During the transition period, the Inviva-owned CVIC issued the Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities pursuant to prospectuses dated May 1, 2002, which had been prepared before Inviva purchased CVIC.  Under a section entitled "Highlights," the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses stated that the product was "intended to be used to accumulate money for retirement or other long-term tax-deferred investment purposes."
18.	The Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses also contained a section entitled "Transfers," which were defined as movements of money between investment options.  This section provided that contract owners were permitted one free transfer between subaccounts per 30-day period.  Further, the Monument prospectus provided that, for any additional transfers, a transfer fee of the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred may be deducted.  Similarly, under a section entitled "Transfer Fee," the Advantage Plus prospectus indicated contract owners might be charged a transfer fee of $25 per transfer for any additional transfers.  In a different section, the Advantage Plus prospectus indicated that a $25 fee may be deducted for additional transfers.
19.	The May 1, 2002 Monument prospectus further stated as follows:
This product is not designed for professional market timing organizations.
[CVIC] reserves the right to modify (including terminating) the
transfer privileges described above.
The May 1, 2002 Advantage Plus prospectus contained substantially similar language.
20.	Finally, the Monument and Advantage Plus May 1, 2002 prospectuses contained a section entitled "Excessive Trading Limits."  This section contained language indicating that CVIC was monitoring excessive trading with a view toward protecting all contract owners' investments.  Specifically, the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses stated the following:
We reserve the right to limit transfers in any Contract year, or to refuse any transfer request for a Contract owner, or third party advisor acting under a Limited Power of Attorney, if:
we believe, in our sole discretion, that excessive trading by the Contract owner, or a specific transfer request, submitted by a third party advisor, or a group of transfer requests, may have a detrimental effect on the accumulation unit values of any subaccount or the share prices of any portfolio or would be detrimental to other Contract owners; or 
we are informed by one or more portfolios that they intend to restrict the purchase of portfolio shares because of excessive trading or because they believe that a specific transfer or group of transfers would have a detrimental effect on the price of portfolio shares.
We may apply the restrictions in any manner reasonably designed to prevent transfers that we consider disadvantageous to other Contract owners.
21.	Starting on May 1, 2003, Inviva and Jefferson National began to issue the Monument and Advantage Plus products under the Jefferson National name, and filed new prospectuses with the Commission.
22.	The May 1, 2003 Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses again contained language that discouraged market timing.  The prospectuses indicated that the products were "not designed for professional market timing organizations" and that Jefferson National reserved "the right to modify" the transfer privileges.  Specifically, the prospectuses contained the following:
Your right to make transfers is subject to modification if we determine,
in our sole opinion, that the exercise of the right by one or more owners is, or
would be, to the disadvantage of other owners.  Restrictions may be applied in
any manner reasonably designed to prevent any use of the transfer right, which is
considered by us to be to the disadvantage of other owners.  A modification could
be applied to transfers to, or from, one or more of the investment portfolios
and could include, but is not limited to:
a.  the requirement of a minimum time period between each transfer;
b.  not accepting a transfer request from an agent acting under a
power of attorney on behalf of more than one owner; or
c.  limiting the dollar amount that may be transferred between
investment portfolios by an owner at any one time.
We reserve the right, at any time, and without prior notice to any
party, to terminate, suspend or modify the transfer privilege during the
accumulation period.
23.	Further, the Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses reiterated the "Excessive Trading Limits" (set forth above) from the CVIC prospectuses.  In addition, the Jefferson National prospectuses identified an additional basis for limiting transfers.  In particular, Jefferson National reserved the right to limit transfers under the following circumstances:
[Y]our transfer request would result in a redemption of a "substantive" amount from an investment portfolio that had been allocated to that portfolio for less than 30 days; "substantive" means a dollar amount that Jefferson National determines, in its sole discretion, could adversely affect the management of the investment portfolio.
24.	Finally, the Jefferson National Monument prospectus indicated (as CVIC's May 1, 2002 prospectus had done) that contract owners were permitted twelve free transfers per year, and that Jefferson National might impose a fee of $25 or 2%, whichever was less, for additional transfers.  The Advantage Plus prospectus indicated that contract owners could make up to twelve transfers per year without charge, and that a $25 transfer fee might be deducted for additional transfers.
25.	The Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose, however, that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers.  Further, the prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy.  In addition, the prospectuses failed to disclose the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.
Inviva facilitated market timing
26.	During the October 2002-May 2003 transition period, two Conseco Services employees introduced Inviva employees to certain of CVIC's market timing customers and brokers, whom the Conseco Services employees referred to as "big ticket" customers.  The Conseco Services employees informed Inviva employees about how to deal with the "big ticket" traders.  The Conseco Services employees gave Inviva employees information identifying both CVIC's market timing customers and the amount of timing capacity available at unaffiliated fund complexes that had permitted timing in their funds.  Inviva did not disclose the existence of the permitted capacity, or its arrangements with funds that permitted market timing, to its other annuitants.
27.	In January 2003, a registered representative at a broker-dealer who represented market timers requested additional market timing capacity for the representative's customers.  An Inviva employee then spoke with a fund representative, who agreed that Inviva could have an additional $10 million in timing capacity.  The registered representative's customers invested the assets, and Inviva agreed to pay the registered representative an "override," or extra commission, of 35 basis points of the value of assets the customers invested.  According to an Inviva employee, the fund representative that had granted the request for additional timing capacity subsequently requested that Inviva add the fund complex's short term bond fund to the Jefferson National Monument and Advantage Plus mutual fund offerings and thereafter required big ticket customers to keep their timing assets in the short term bond fund when not being used to time other funds.  Doing this had the effect of increasing the fees that the fund complex earned. 
28.	After the transition period, Inviva and Jefferson National allowed the market timing to continue in accordance with the limits CVIC had received from the unaffiliated mutual funds.  Inviva's Director of Sales and Marketing apparently recognized the advantages of managing market timing assets, and suggested obtaining timing capacity at other mutual fund complexes.  A May 19, 2003 e-mail from the director to another Inviva employee indicated that "we should probably put together a list of funds people want to use that won't let us and go tour the fund [companies] explaining how it is a harmless and cheap way to take in some money."
29.	Although the market timers executed significantly more than the permissible number of free transfers, Jefferson National did not exercise the right to impose the transfer fee set out in the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses.  Further, Jefferson National did not make any independent effort to determine whether market timing was harmful to other Jefferson National variable annuity purchasers.
30.	With respect to funds that had not agreed to provide capacity for timing assets, Inviva did not prevent timers from trading in those funds unless the fund complained.  Instead, Jefferson National simply followed the various unaffiliated mutual fund complexes' instructions, including instructions to block trades, when the fund complexes identified a Jefferson National customer as a market timer.  Moreover, Jefferson National did not inform these fund complexes that certain Monument and Advantage Plus customers were executing a market timing strategy.
31.	On March 12, 2003, a Conseco Services employee sent an e-mail to an Inviva employee concerning timers that the Conseco Services employee had identified as having traded in a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity.  The Conseco Services employee asked the Inviva employee to advise the fund complex that CVIC had identified the timers and that CVIC "do[es] not tolerate timers."  Both the Conseco Services and Inviva employees knew, however, that CVIC not only tolerated market timers, but also solicited market timers.
32.	In late April 2003, a representative of a fund that had not agreed to provide timing capacity, and indeed had previously closed a Europe fund portfolio to CVIC investors due to market timing, sent an e-mail to the same Inviva employee.  In the e-mail, the fund representative confirmed that the fund would reopen the portfolio to Jefferson National investors "based on your 'zero tolerance policy' and procedures you communicated to me with respect to kicking out timers from the products where [the fund's] portfolios are available."  In fact, Jefferson National did not maintain a zero tolerance policy and did not kick timers out of the Monument and Advantage Plus products.
33.	In early May 2003, one of the funds that had agreed to provide capacity for timing assets informed Inviva that the allowed timing capacity in the fund's emerging markets portfolio needed to be reduced from approximately $50 million to $30 million, i.e., a decrease of $20 million.  The Inviva employee that had received the March 12, 2003 e-mail then divided the $30 million in available capacity among certain favored timing clients.  The timers advised the Inviva employee that they intended to invest the $20 million that was no longer permitted in the emerging markets portfolio in other international funds, which had not agreed to provide timing capacity, until additional capacity became available in the emerging markets portfolio.  Although the Inviva employee warned the timers that the international funds might complain if they traded in and out, the employee did not inform these international funds that timers intended to use their funds.
34.	In a May 16, 2003 e-mail, the same Inviva employee asked another Inviva employee whether there was "any way to verify if big dollars are going to the illegal international funds?"  The other Inviva employee replied that "I know there is (sic) a number of timers playing in and out of [a worldwide growth portfolio that had not agreed to provide timing capacity] with moves of $250k or less.  Just enough to stay below the radar."
35.	In August 2003, the Inviva employee who had divided the $30 million in timing capacity learned that there was no more timing capacity in the emerging markets portfolio.  The Inviva employee sent an e-mail on August 13, 2003 to the employee's supervisor, the Director of Sales and Marketing, indicating that the employee had accommodated some of the market timers by allowing them to trade in other international mutual funds that had not agreed to provide timing capacity.  The message concluded as follows: "Since our Int'l [international] funds are sensitive, it's been a bit of a juggle."
Inviva profited from annuity contract owners' market timing
36.	Inviva and Jefferson National earned fees on the Monument and Advantage Plus products while they were allowing market timing.  Inviva earned approximately $1.9 million in fees during the transition period from October 23, 2002 through April 30, 2003, and approximately $2.5 million during the period from May 1, 2003 through November 7, 2003.
Dilution caused by the market timing activity
37.	As a result of the market timing activity in Monument and Advantage Plus variable annuities,  the value of annuitants' investments was diluted.
Violations
38.	As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in that Respondents made untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Specifically, the Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations, and gave the misleading impression that Respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades.  Further, Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers, that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy, and the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.
39.	As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act in that they made an untrue statement of material fact in a registration statement, application, report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to the Investment Company Act, or omitted to state therein any fact necessary in order to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, from being materially misleading.  Specifically, Respondents filed registration statements with the Commission containing prospectuses that falsely stated that these products were not designed for professional market timing organizations, and gave the misleading impression that Respondents would act independently to monitor or block detrimental trades.  Further, Monument and Advantage Plus prospectuses failed to disclose that Jefferson National was selling the products to market timers, that Jefferson National was facilitating the market timing customers in carrying out a market timing strategy, and the risk that the market timers' rapid trading might have a negative impact on the other variable annuity purchasers' investment returns.
Undertaking
40.	Ongoing Cooperation.  In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered the following undertaking by Respondents:  

Respondents shall cooperate fully with the Commission in any and all investigations, litigations or other proceedings relating to or arising from the matters described in the Order.  In connection with such cooperation, Respondents have undertaken:

b.	To use their best efforts to cause their employees to be interviewed by the Commission's staff at such times as the staff reasonably may direct;
c.	To use their best efforts to cause their employees to appear and testify truthfully and completely without service of a notice or subpoena in such investigations, depositions, hearings or trials as may be requested by the Commission's staff; and
d.	That in connection with any testimony of Respondents to be conducted at deposition, hearing or trial pursuant to a notice or subpoena, Respondents:

i.	Agree that any such notice or subpoena for Respondents' appearance and testimony may be served by regular mail on their attorney, Joseph Moodhe, Esq., Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022; and
ii.	Agree that any such notice or subpoena for Respondents' appearance and testimony in an action pending in a United States District Court may be served, and may require testimony, beyond the territorial limits imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.



41.	Independent Compliance Consultant.  Respondents shall retain, within 30 days of the date of entry of the Order, the services of an Independent Compliance Consultant not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission.  The Independent Compliance Consultant's compensation and expenses shall be borne exclusively by Respondents or their affiliates.  The Respondents shall require the Independent Compliance Consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of Respondents' supervisory, compliance, and other policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect market timing and related practices that may violate the federal securities laws.  This review shall include, but shall not be limited to, a review of Respondents' market timing controls across all areas of its business, and a review of Respondents' utilization of short term trading fees or other controls for deterring excessive short term trading.  Respondents shall cooperate fully with the Independent Compliance Consultant and shall provide the Independent Compliance Consultant with access to their files, books, records, and personnel as reasonably requested for the review.

a.	Respondents shall require that, at the conclusion of the review, which in no event shall be more than 120 days after the date of entry of the Order, the Independent Compliance Consultant shall submit a Report to Respondents and the staff of the Commission.  The Report shall address the issues described in paragraph 41 of these undertakings, and shall include a description of the review performed, the conclusions reached, the Independent Compliance Consultant's recommendations for changes in or improvements to policies and procedures of Respondents and a procedure for implementing the recommended changes in or improvements to Respondents' policies and procedures.
b.	Respondents shall adopt all recommendations with respect to Respondents contained in the Report of the Independent Compliance Consultant; provided, however, that within 150 days after the date of entry of the Order, Respondents shall in writing advise the Independent Compliance Consultant and the staff of the Commission of any recommendations that it considers to be unnecessary or inappropriate.  With respect to any recommendation that Respondents consider unnecessary or inappropriate, Respondents need not adopt that recommendation at that time but shall propose in writing an alternative policy, procedure or system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.
c.	As to any recommendation with respect to Respondents' policies and procedures on which Respondents and the Independent Compliance Consultant do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 180 days of the date of entry of the Order. In the event Respondents and the Independent Compliance Consultant are unable to agree on an alternative proposal acceptable to the staff of the Commission, Respondents will abide by the determinations of the Independent Compliance Consultant.
d.	Respondents (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the Independent Compliance Consultant, without the prior written approval of the staff of the Commission; (ii) shall compensate the Independent Compliance Consultant, and persons engaged to assist the Independent Compliance Consultant, for services rendered pursuant to the Order at their reasonable and customary rates; and, (iii) shall not be in and shall not have an attorney-client relationship with the Independent Compliance Consultant and shall not seek to invoke the attorney-client or any other doctrine or privilege to prevent the Independent Compliance Consultant from transmitting any information, reports, or documents to the Commission.
e.	Respondents shall require that the Independent Compliance Consultant, for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the engagement, shall not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Respondents, or any of their present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such.  Respondents shall require that any firm with which the Independent Compliance Consultant is affiliated in performance of his or her duties under the Order shall not, without prior written consent of the staff of the Commission, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Respondents, or any of their present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement.

42.	Periodic Compliance Review.  Commencing in 2005, and at least once every other year thereafter, Respondents shall undergo a compliance review by a third party, who is not an interested person, as defined in the Investment Company Act, of Respondents.  At the conclusion of the review, the third party shall issue a report of its findings and recommendations concerning Respondents' supervisory, compliance, and other policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect market timing and related practices that may violate the federal securities laws as they apply to Respondents' variable annuity business.  Each such report shall be promptly delivered to the Respondents' Chief Compliance Officer.
43.	Independent Distribution Consultant.  Respondents shall retain, within 30 days of the date of entry of the Order, the services of an Independent Distribution Consultant not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission.  The Independent Distribution Consultant's compensation and expenses shall be borne by Respondents.  Respondents shall cooperate fully with the Independent Distribution Consultant and shall provide the Independent Distribution Consultant with access to their files, books, records, and personnel as reasonably requested for the review.  Respondents shall require that the Independent Distribution Consultant develop a Distribution Plan for the distribution of all of the disgorgement and penalty ordered in Section IV.C.1 of the Order, and any interest or earnings thereon, according to a methodology developed in consultation with Respondents and acceptable to the staff of the Commission.  The Distribution Plan shall provide for investors to receive, from the monies available for distribution, their proportionate share of losses suffered by virtue of the market timing through Jefferson National's variable annuity products.

a.	Respondents shall require that the Independent Distribution Consultant submit a Distribution Plan to Respondents and the staff of the Commission no more than 100 days after the date of entry of the Order.  
b.	The Distribution Plan developed by the Independent Distribution Consultant shall be binding unless, within 130 days after the date of entry of the Order, Respondents or the staff of the Commission advises, in writing, the Independent Distribution Consultant of any determination or calculation from the Distribution Plan that it considers to be inappropriate and states in writing the reasons for considering such determination or calculation inappropriate.
c.	With respect to any determination or calculation with which Respondents or the staff of the Commission do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within 160 days of the date of entry of the Order.  In the event that Respondents and the staff of the Commission are unable to agree on an alternative determination or calculation, the determinations and calculations of the Independent Distribution Consultant shall be binding.
d.	Within 175 days of the date of entry of the Order, Respondents shall require that the Independent Distribution Consultant submit the Distribution Plan for the administration and distribution of disgorgement and penalty funds pursuant to Rule 1101 [17 C.F.R. � 201.1101] of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Following a Commission order approving a final plan of disgorgement, as provided in Rule 1104 [17 C.F.R. � 201.1104] of the Commission's Rules of Practice, Respondents shall require that the Independent Distribution Consultant, with Respondents, take all necessary and appropriate steps to administer the final plan for distribution of disgorgement and penalty funds.
e.	Respondents shall require that the Independent Distribution Consultant, for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the engagement, not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Respondents, or any of their present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such.  Respondents shall require that any firm with which the Independent Distribution Consultant is affiliated in performance of his or her duties under the Order not, without prior written consent of the staff of the Commission, enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Respondents, or any of their present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or agents acting in their capacity as such for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement.

44.	Certification.  No later than twenty-four months after the date of entry of the Order, the chief executive officer of each Respondent shall certify to the Commission in writing that the Respondents have fully adopted and complied in all material respects with the undertakings set forth in paragraphs 41 through this paragraph 43 and with the recommendations of the Independent Compliance Consultant or, in the event of material non-adoption or non-compliance, shall describe such material non-adoption and non-compliance
45.	Recordkeeping.  Respondents shall preserve for a period not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year last used, the first two years in an easily accessible place, any record of Respondents' compliance with the undertakings set forth in paragraphs 41 through this paragraph 44.
46.	Deadlines.  For good cause shown, the Commission's staff may extend any of the procedural dates set forth above.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents' Offer.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A.	Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the Exchange Act, and Section 9(f) of the Investment Company Act, Inviva and Jefferson National shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act.
B.	Respondents shall comply with the undertakings enumerated in Section III, paragraphs 41 through 45.
C.	Disgorgement and Civil Money Penalties

1.	Respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay disgorgement in the total amount of $3,500,000 ("Disgorgement") and Jefferson National shall pay civil money penalties in the amount of $1,500,000 ("Penalties"), for a total payment of $5,000,000.
2.	There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair Fund established for the funds described in Section IV.C.1.  Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes.  To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that they shall not, in any Related Investor Action, benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor's claim by the amount of any Fair Fund distribution to such investor in this proceeding that is proportionately attributable to the civil penalty paid by Respondents ("Penalty Offset").  If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such an offset or reduction, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the offset or reduction, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs.  Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed against Respondents in this proceeding.  For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as those set forth in the Order.
3.	Pursuant to an escrow agreement not unacceptable to the staff of the Commission, Respondents shall, within 175 days of the entry of this Order, pay the Disgorgement and Penalties into an escrow account.  The escrow agreement shall, among other things: (1) require that all funds in escrow be invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturities not to exceed six months;  (2) name an escrow agent who shall be appropriately bonded; and (3) provide that escrowed funds be disbursed only pursuant to an order of the Commission.  Respondents shall be responsible for all costs associated with the escrow agreement.

D.	Other Obligations and Requirements.  Nothing in this Order shall relieve Respondents of any other applicable legal obligation or requirement, including any rule adopted by the Commission subsequent to this Order.

By the Commission.

Secretary

Jefferson National Variable Annuities

[ad#adsense1]
Jefferson National is more than your average financial adviser and this is attributed to the fact that the advisers working here help you understand the urgency of investing in annuities more than depending on the 401(K) or personal IRA for future dependency. This is mainly because if you are looking forward to creating long term wealth, then you have to understand that these two are taxed and as such, they lower your savings in the long run. Unlike with other annuity companies, what Jefferson National offers you is the tools needed to make comparisons on investing in taxable accounts and investing in tax deferred account through MAX comparison tools. 
Though you have some sound knowledge on investments, Jefferson National understands how daunting managing a portfolio is and as such, they are dedicated to ensure that they keep you on top of the market conditions. They are also able to tailor the annuity provision to suit to your needs while evaluating every financial investment with the qualified eyes of an objective advisor. In addition to this, they will also ensure that they evaluate any risks you might face in the investment process and advice you accordingly. 
One of the major annuities offered at Jefferson National is the variable annuity which will increase your savings in an exponential manner. There are several aspects which make this annuity suitable for all kinds of investors and key among them is the ability to put into the portfolio an unlimited contribution. The second advantage is the fact that it is tax-deferred which means that at the end of the day, you will be saving more than if you were in a taxable program. The third advantage which is equally important as the first two is the fact that with a variable annuity from Jefferson National, you are able to choose the manner in which you prefer to contribute towards your investment.
Though there are other companies that offer annuities, with Jefferson National, a distinct difference is noted as theirs, which is a Monument advisor trump offers a flat insurance fee of twenty dollars a month regardless of the invested amount. In addition to this, they will offer countless fund options which cannot be found at any other non qualified annuity provided in the market today and which cover a variety of asset groups. Jefferson Nationals variable annuity also ensures that they do not charge any sale commissions on the product and as such, eradicate all the nonsensical issues that clients face dealing with sales people. If you want to join this annuity program, you also have to note that you do not have to pay any insurance based fees nor do you have to worry about hidden fees in the structure because all you need to do is pay investment management fee.
Jefferson National appears has your best interests at heart and as such, you should not contend with saving for your future with taxable programs that make you lag behind with your investment. Consult Jefferson and start experiencing future financial freedom today.

Applicants' and Section 17 Applicants' Representations 
1. JNL is a stock life insurance company originally organized in 1937 under the laws of Texas. 
2. Separate Account C was established in 1980. Separate Account C is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-04819) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. Two variable annuity contracts funded by Separate Account C are affected by this application. 
Separate Account E was established in 1993. Separate Account E is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-08288) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Account E is affected by this application. 
Separate Account F was established in 1997. Separate Account F is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-08483) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Account F is affected by this application. 
Separate Account G was established in 1996. Separate Account G is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-07501) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. Three variable annuity contracts funded by Separate Account G are affected by this application. 
Separate Account H was established in 1999. Separate Account H is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-09693) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Start Printed Page 13927Account H is affected by this application. 
Separate Account I was established in 2000. Separate Account I is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-10213) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Account I is affected by this application. 
Separate Account J was established in 2003. Separate Account J is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-21498) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Account J is affected by this application. 
Separate Account K was established in 2003. Separate Account K is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-21500) and is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by JNL. One variable annuity contract funded by Separate Account K is affected by this application. 
Separate Account L was established in 2000. Separate Account L is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust (File No. 811-10271) and is used to fund variable universal life contracts issued by JNL. One variable universal life contract funded by Separate Account L is affected by this application (all eleven variable annuity contracts and the one variable universal life contract affected by this application are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Contracts”). 
3. NLVT was organized in Delaware as a statutory trust on November 2, 2005 and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. 
4. Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC (“PIMCO”) is the investment adviser for the PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust Money Market Portfolio (the “Replaced Fund”). PIMCO and the Replaced Fund are not affiliated with JNL. JNF Advisors, Inc. (“JNF Advisor”) is a recently formed investment adviser under common control with JNL. JNF Advisor will serve as investment adviser to the JNF Money Market Portfolio (the “Replacement Fund”). A I M Advisors, Inc. (“AIM”) will be sub-adviser for the Replacement Fund. AIM is not affiliated with JNL. There are no corporate affiliations among the investment advisers. 
5. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate Accounts (the “Sub-Accounts”). Income, gains and losses, whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the Separate Accounts are credited to or charged against the Separate Accounts without regard to other income, gains or losses of JNL. The assets maintained in the Separate Accounts will not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any other business conducted by JNL. Nevertheless, all obligations arising under the Contracts, including the commitment to make annuity payments or death benefit payments, are general corporate obligations of JNL. Accordingly, all of the assets of JNL are available to meet its obligations under the Contracts. 
6. The Contracts permit allocations of account value to available Sub-Accounts that invest in specific investment portfolios of underlying registered investment companies (a “Fund” and, collectively, the “Mutual Funds”). The Mutual Funds are registered under the Act as open-end management investment companies. 
7. The Contracts permit transfers of accumulation value from one Sub-Account to another Sub-Account at any time subject to certain restrictions. No sales charge applies to such a transfer of accumulation value among Sub-Accounts. A transaction fee is imposed on purchases or redemptions involving Sub-Accounts (“Transaction Fee Sub-Accounts”) which invest in certain Funds.[1] 
           None of the Transaction Fee Sub-Accounts hold shares of a money market fund. 
8. The Contracts reserve the right, upon notice to contract owners (the “Contract Owners”), to substitute shares of another mutual fund for shares of a Fund held by a Sub-Account. 
9. After the Substitution, the investment objective and policies of the Replacement Fund will be substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the Replaced Fund. 
10. JNF Advisor will serve as the investment adviser for the Replacement Fund. However, the management of the Replacement Fund will be sub-advised by AIM. For the Replaced Fund and the Replacement Fund, the investment objectives, principal risks, investment adviser/sub-adviser, and fee structure are shown in the tables that follow. The tables also show the Replaced Fund's expenses for the fiscal year ending in 2007 and assets as of December 31, 2007.

JNF Advisor may discontinue the contractual limits at any time after April 30, 2009, subject to the condition in this Application relating to the maximum total operating expenses for the Replacement Fund for the 24 months following the Substitution.
The Applicants believe that the Replacement Fund is an appropriate substitute for the Replaced Fund because the investment objective and policies of the Replacement Fund are substantially similar to those of the Replaced Fund. Because the Substitution involves replacing one money market fund with another money market fund, the Substitution will not result in a reduced number or a change in the investment characteristics of the investment options offered under the Contracts. 
12. The Substitution will take place at the Funds' relative net asset values determined on the date of the Substitution in accordance with Section 22 of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's account value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Sub-Accounts. Accordingly, there will be no financial impact on any Contract Owner. 
13. The Substitution may be effected by having each of the Sub-Accounts that invests in the Replaced Fund redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the Substitution and purchase shares of the Replacement Fund at the net asset value calculated on the same date. 
14. In the alternative, should the Replaced Fund determine that a cash redemption would adversely affect its shareholders, it may redeem the interest “in-kind.” In that case, the Substitution will be effected by the Sub-Account contributing all the securities it receives from the Replaced Fund for an amount of Replacement Fund shares equal to the fair market value of the securities contributed. All in-kind redemptions from the Replaced Fund of which any of the Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Commission's no-action letter issued to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (available Dec. 28, 1999). 
15. The Substitution will be described in a supplement to the prospectuses for the Contracts (“Supplement”) filed with the Commission and mailed to Contract Owners. The Supplement will provide Contract Owners with notice of the Substitution and describe the reasons for engaging in the Substitution. The Supplement also will inform Contract Owners with assets allocated to a Sub-Account investing in the Replaced Fund that the Replaced Fund will not be an available investment option after the date of the Substitution and that Contract Owners will have the opportunity to reallocate account value on one day to one or more Sub-Accounts: 

Prior to the Substitution, from the Sub-Accounts investing in the Replaced Fund, and 
For 30 days after the Substitution, from the Sub-Accounts investing in the Replacement Fund to Sub-Accounts investing in another Fund available under the respective Contracts,

Without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation, other than the transaction fee applicable to certain Sub-Accounts and any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive trading.[2] 

16. The prospectuses for the Contracts will contain the substance of the information contained in the Supplement concerning the Substitution. Each Contract Owner will be provided with a prospectus for the Replacement Fund before the Substitution, unless the Replacement Fund becomes effective contemporaneously with the Substitutions, in which case a prospectus will be sent to affected Contract Owners with the written confirmation. Within five days after the Substitution, JNL will send affected Contract Owners written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred and notice that Contract Owners will have the opportunity to reallocate account value for 30 days after the Substitution, from the Sub-Accounts investing in the Replacement Fund to Sub-Accounts investing in another Fund available under the respective Contracts, without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation, other than the transaction fee applicable to certain Sub-Accounts and any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive trading. Start Printed Page 13929

17. JNL will pay all direct and indirect expenses and transaction costs of the Substitution, including all legal, accounting and brokerage expenses relating to the Substitution. No costs will be borne by Contract Owners. Affected Contract Owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the obligations of the Applicants under the Contracts be altered in any way. The Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract Owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract Owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract Owners. 
18. Applicants believe that their request satisfies the standards for relief pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act, as set forth below, because the affected Contract Owners will have: 
(1) Account values allocated to a Sub-Account invested in the Replacement Fund with an investment objective and policies substantially similar to the investment objective and policies of the Replaced Fund; and 
(2) The Replacement Fund whose current total annual expenses will be no higher than that of the Replaced Fund for its 2007 fiscal year because, as described below, JNL has agreed to, for a period of 24 months following the Substitutions, limit the total net expenses of the Replacement Fund to those of the Replaced Fund for the 2007 fiscal year. At the end of the 24 month period it is possible that the expenses of the Replacement Fund may be higher. 
Applicants' and Section 17 Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. The Applicants represent that Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
2. The Applicants note that the purpose of Section 26(c) is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer by preventing unscrutinized substitutions that might, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium payments, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds, or both. Moreover, in the insurance product context, a Contract Owner forced to redeem may suffer adverse tax consequences. Section 26(c) affords this protection to investors by preventing a depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that holds shares of one issuer from substituting for those shares the shares of another issuer, unless the Commission approves that substitution. 
3. The Applicants assert that the purposes, terms and conditions of the Substitution are consistent with the principles and purposes of Section 26(c) and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) is designed to prevent. Applicants have reserved the right to make such a substitution under the Contracts and this reserved right is disclosed in the prospectus for the Contracts. 
4. The Applicants submit that the investment objectives and policies of the Replacement Fund are sufficiently similar to those of the Replaced Fund that Contract Owners will have continuity in investment expectations. Accordingly, the Replacement Fund is an appropriate investment vehicle for those Contract Owners who have account values allocated to the Replaced Fund. 
5. The Applicants represent that for the 24-month period following the date of the Substitution, JNL agrees to limit the total operating expenses of the Replacement Fund (taking into account any expense waiver or reimbursement) on an annualized basis to the net expense level of the Replaced Fund for the 2007 fiscal year. In addition, for 24 months following the Substitution, JNL will not increase asset-based fees or charges for Contracts outstanding on the day of the Substitution. JNL represents that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Fund were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid by the Replacement Fund, its adviser. its sub-adviser or underwriters, or their respective affiliates.[3] 

6. The Applicants assert that the Substitution will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was intended to guard against and, for the following reasons, is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the Act: 
(1) The Replacement Fund is an appropriate fund to which to move Contract Owners with account values allocated to the Replaced Fund because the new fund has substantially similar investment objectives and policies. 
(2) The costs of the Substitution, including any brokerage costs, will be borne by JNL and will not be borne by Contract Owners. No charges will be assessed to effect the Substitution. 
(3) The Substitution will be at the net asset value of the shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's account value. 
(4) The Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract Owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution and will result in Contract Owners' account values being moved to a Fund with the same or lower current total annual expenses. 
(5) All Contract Owners will be given notice of the Substitution prior to the Substitution and will have an opportunity before, and for 30 days after, the Substitution to reallocate account value among other available Sub-Accounts without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year and without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation, other than the transaction fee applicable to certain Sub-Accounts and any applicable limitations in place to deter potentially harmful excessive trading or limitation on the number of transfers to or from the fixed accounts available with the variable annuity contracts. 
(6) Within five days after the Substitution, JNL will send to its affected Contract Owners written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred. 
(7) The Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contract Owners or the contractual obligations of JNL. 
(8) The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract Owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract Owners. 
(9) The Replacement Fund will not rely on any “manager of managers” Start Printed Page 13930exemptive relief unless such action is approved by a majority of the Replacement Fund's shareholders at a meeting whose record date is after the Substitution has been effected. 
7. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit JNL to carry out the proposed substitution. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. 
8. JNL, as depositor of the Separate Accounts, is an affiliate of the Separate Accounts and also JNF Advisor, which serves as investment adviser for the affected NLVT series. As such, JNF Advisor could be deemed to control the affected NLVT series and be an affiliate of the affected NLVT series. Assuming, for this or other reasons, that an affected NLVT series is an affiliate of an affiliate of JNL, to the extent the Separate Accounts each use assets received in-kind to purchase Replacement Fund Shares, the substitutions would involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between persons who are affiliates of affiliates. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants are seeking relief, to the extent necessary, from Section 17(a) for the in-kind purchases and sales of Replacement Fund Shares. 
9. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: 
(1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; 
(2) The proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and 
(3) The proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 
10. The Section 17 Applicants submit that, for all the reasons set forth in paragraphs 3-6 immediately above, the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Fund by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in this Application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of JNL and the affected NLVT series. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 
11. The Section 17 Applicants assert that, to the extent the Separate Account's in-kind purchases of Replacement Fund shares are deemed to involve principal transactions between entities which are affiliates of affiliates, the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants. The Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchase transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received by each Fund involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching. In addition, although not applicable, the in-kind transactions will conform with all except one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's account value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any Sub-Account. Contract Owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitution. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the substitution. Even though they may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching. 
12. The Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the Replacement Fund's procedures thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitution will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to the Replacement Fund from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, JNL (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transaction at a price that is disadvantageous to the Replacement Fund. Although the transaction may not be entirely for cash, it will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of the Fund valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed in-kind transaction. 
13. The Section 17 Applicants assert that the sale of shares of the Replacement Fund for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed in-kind transaction, is consistent with the investment policy and restrictions of the Replacement Fund because (1) the shares are sold at their net asset value, and (2) the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the Replacement Fund would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash. To assure that the second of these conditions is met, the sub-adviser will examine the portfolio securities being offered to the Replacement Fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for such fund in a cash transaction. 
14. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed in-kind transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the Act. The proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the Act was designed to prevent. In particular, Sections 1(b)(2) and (3) of the Act state, among other things, that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected “when investment companies are organized, operated, managed, or their portfolio securities are selected in the interest of directors, officers, investment advisers, depositors, or other affiliated persons thereof, or in the interests of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business, rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies' security holders; * * * when investment companies issue securities containing inequitable or discriminatory provisions, or fail to protect the preferences and privileges of the holders of their outstanding Start Printed Page 13931securities * * *.” For all the reasons stated in Sections V.B. and VI of the Application, the abuses described in Sections l(b)(2) and (3) of the Act will not occur in connection with the proposed in-kind purchases. 
15. The Section 17 Applicants note that the Commission has previously granted exemptions from Section 17(a) in circumstances substantially similar in all material respects to those presented in this Application to applicants affiliated with an open-end management investment company that proposed to purchase shares issued by the company with investment securities of the type that the company might otherwise have purchased for its portfolio. In these cases, the Commission issued an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act where the expense of liquidating such investment securities and using the cash proceeds to purchase shares of the investment company would have reduced the value of investors' ultimate investment in such shares. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the Applicants and the Section 17 Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and Section 17(b), respectively, and should, therefore, be granted.

2.
     There are five Transaction Fee Sub-Accounts which are available only under one annuity contract (File No. 333-124048) which offers 160 no-fee Sub-Accounts. The Transaction Fee Sub-Accounts hold shares of the following Nationwide VIT Index Funds: S&P 500; Small Cap; Mid Cap; International and Bond. These funds have investment characteristics which are completely unlike those of the Pimco Variable Insurance Trust Money Market Portfolio which is being replaced in the Substitution. In light of the foregoing Applicants do not believe there is any investor protection basis not to allow the substituted Contract Owners to bear a charge applicable to all other Contract Owners seeking to invest in a Transaction Fee Sub-Account.

3.
     In this regard, JNL has been receiving .30% annually in “revenue sharing” with respect to investments by its separate accounts in the Replaced Fund and expects that it will receive that same percentage amount from the Replacement Fund. With respect to the Replaced Fund, JNL receives .15% pursuant to the Replaced Fund's Administrative Services Plan and .15% from the Replaced Fund's investment adviser for non-marketing services rendered to current and prospective Contract Owners. With respect to the Replacement Fund, JNL expects to receive from the Replacement Fund .30% for administrative services.

 ISSUED BY
CONSECO VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT F
 AND
CONSECO VARIABLE INSURANCE COMPANY

       The purpose of this supplement is to offer two new investment options
in the prospectus for the Conseco Advantage Fixed and Variable Annuity.         

    As of the date of this supplement, June 24, 2002, the Levco Equity
Value Fund and Van Eck o Levin Mid Cap Value Fund (series of the LEVCO Series   
Trust) are available as new investment options in the Conseco Advantage Fixed   
and Variable Annuity. You can allocate new premiums and transfer contract value 
into the Levco Equity Value and Van Eck o Levin Mid Cap Value subaccounts by    
giving us instructions. You can also include the Levco Equity Value and Van Eck 
o Levin Mid Cap Value subaccounts in your instructions to us regarding the asset
rebalancing, dollar cost averaging and/or systematic withdrawal program by      
calling us at (866) 590-2255.                                                   

     The date of prospectus for the Conseco Advantage Fixed and Variable
Annuity is revised to June 24, 2002, and the prospectus is amended as follows:  

1.       THE FRONT COVER                                                        

The first sentence of the second paragraph on the front cover is revised to     
read:                                                                           

        "The Contract has 62 investment options - a fixed account which offers
        an interest rate which is guaranteed not to be less than 3% by Conseco
    Variable, the interest adjustment account, and 60 subaccounts that
invest in the portfolios listed below."                       

All other references to 60 investment options or 58 subaccounts or portfolios   
appearing elsewhere in the prospectus are amended to refer to 62 investment

ITEM 28.  INDEMNIFICATION 

    The Bylaws (Article VI) of the Company provide, in part, that: The
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened  
to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or    
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason
of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee  
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other     
enterprise (collectively, "Agent") against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, penalties, court costs and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or          
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to  
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his    
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by     
judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,      
create a presumption that the Agent did not act in good faith and in a manner   
which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of   
the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no 
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. If several claims,   
issues or matters are involved, an Agent may be entitled to indemnification as  
to some matters even though he is not entitled as to other matters. Any director
or officer of the Corporation serving in any capacity of another corporation, of
which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors
is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall be deemed to be doing
so at the request of the Corporation.                                           

       Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted directors and officers or controlling persons of   
the Company pursuant to the foregoing, or otherwise, the Company has been       
advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such      
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and, therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such       
liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful   
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the   
Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled  
by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the     
question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as         
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such     
issue.

        (a) Registrant hereby undertakes to file a post-effective amendment to
this registration statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure that the    
audited financial statements in the registration statement are never more than  
sixteen (16) months old for so long as payment under the variable annuity

action if registered separate accounts funding tax-sheltered annuity contracts  
restrict distributions to plan participants in accordance with the requirements 
of Section 403(b)(11), provided certain conditions and requirements were met.   
Among these conditions and requirements, any registered separate account relying
on the no-action position of the SEC must:

403(b) annuity contract, prior to or at the time of such purchase, a signed     
statement acknowledging the participant's understanding of (i) the restrictions 
on redemption imposed by Section 403(b)(11), and (ii) the investment            
alternatives available under the employer's Section 403(b) arrangement, to which
the participant may elect to transfer his contract value.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
