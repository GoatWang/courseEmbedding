Humble Beginnings
Jahn Levin, current President and CEO, founded Purity Products® in 1993 in Great Neck, NY. What started as a three person operation has blossomed into a thriving, nutritional and health products company, with well over one million customers. 
Purity on the Move
For over 20 years now, as Purity Products® moved from Great Neck, to New Hyde Park, to Port Washington to Plainview, the company has thrived and our dedication to evidence based nutraceuticals has grown. Now in our new headquarters in Plainview, New York in April since 2006, we have made greater commitments to technology and dedicated even more resources to serving our customers even better.


In the spirit of keeping the world healthier, Purity is proud to have launched our Green initiative. Learn more.

Elevating Our Game to Serve You Better

With a broader line of evidence based supplements, highly trained customer care department and more advanced shipping facilities, Purity looks forward to being your source for science based nutraceuticals. 
Our goal is to create the very satisfied customer and to exceed your expectations in every facet of business we conduct with our valued customers.
















Dear Valued Customer,
As an industry leader for over 20 years, Purity Products' goal is to provide you with Evidence Based Nutraceuticals to help you look and feel your best. Along with our highly respected panel of experts, we continue to lead the industry by developing truly cutting edge, research based nutritional formulas which feature the latest scientific research. That is the Purity Difference.
Our Goal is to Exceed Your Expectations
Our commitment is to YOU the customer. Our goal at Purity is to elevate both our products and service, thereby providing you with an unparalleled nutritional experience. To take your health to a higher level you need to a company that can deliver vitamins and nutritional formulations of uncompromising quality. Purity takes this responsibility seriously.

With our passion for research and customer satisfaction we look forward to helping you along your journey to better health.

Yours in good health,

Jahn Levin, President, Purity Products®














 
The Vitamin Angels
It is not only important to me as an individual, but also for my company as well, to have strong core values in the fundamental principles of integrity, commitment and civic responsibility. At Purity Products® we work with the Vitamin Angels Alliance  and Island Harvest to help make the world a healthier place to live. 
Teaming Up with the Vitamin Angels to Eradicate Child Blindness
The leading health risk in the world, accounting for more deaths each year than cancer, AIDS, or heart disease, is lack of food. Children are particularly susceptible to malnutrition, and more than 100 million children suffer each year from Vitamin A deficiency.

 As a result, this year, more than 4,000,000 children will go blind in third world countries. 
500,000 of these children will completely lose their vision and half of those will go on to die of simple infections and diseases. That's why Vitamin Angels has teamed with Nutrition industry leaders to launch Operation 20/20, an effort to completely eradicate blindness caused by Vitamin A deficiency by the year 2020.
Eradicating Child Blindness
To prevent a malnourished child from going blind, all it takes is two high-dose Vitamin A supplements per child per year. Purity Products® recently donated $50,000 to Vitamin Angels— enough to prevent up to 200,000 children from going blind, and we will continue to donate.

About Us







Founded in 1993

Purity Products was founded in 1993 by current President and CEO Jahn Levin in 
Great Neck, NY. While Purity Products was originally incorporated as Water Pure, 
Inc., and water filters were our first products, almost since our inception the 
passion, purpose and emphasis of our entire organization has been to develop 
science based nutritional supplements and deliver them directly to our 
customers at an excellent value.  What started as a three person operation has 
blossomed into a thriving, nutritional and health products company, with well over three million 
customers. For over 20 years now, as Purity Products moved from Great Neck, to 
New Hyde Park, to Port Washington to Plainview, the company has thrived and our 
dedication to evidence based nutraceuticals has grown. 
See our commitment to quality assurance here.
A Deep Dedication to Quality & Customer Care
Now in our new headquarters in Plainview, New York since April 2006, we have 
made greater commitments to technology and dedicated even more resources to 
serving our customers even better. Our Panel of Advisors help formulate our 
flagship nutritional formulas, which include our Perfect 
Multi Formulas, HA 
Formulas, Dr. 
Cannell's Vitamin D, Co-Q10
