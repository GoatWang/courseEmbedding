Kyto Biopharma Inc. Announces Licensing Agreement With The Research Foundation Of The State University Of New York (RFSUNY)






Business Wire




Mar 4, 2010 10:53 AM EST













 


















































  Kyto Biopharma Inc. (“Kyto”), (OTCBB: KBPH), is pleased to announce that it has signed a licensing agreement with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York, (“RFSUNY”). The licensing agreement grants Kyto patent rights to the Transcobalamin (Vitamin B 12) Receptor and to an additional broad group of other patents which are critical to Kyto’s research and development strategy for the treatment of cancer.  Kyto Scientists have isolated and cloned the Transcobalamin Receptor which has been shown to be over expressed in various forms of cancer. The primary therapeutic approach developed by Kyto is directed at the selective targeting of the Transcobalamin Receptor in cancer cells by monoclonal antibodies. This approach intends to minimize many of the potential complications arising from current chemotherapy treatments such as acute systemic toxicity.  To date Kyto has been successful in developing specific murine monoclonal antibodies to the Transcobalamin Receptor. A candidate antibody identified as mAbTCR23, has been demonstrated to be effective in targeting cancer cells and in inhibiting cell proliferation in a number of cell lines including solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies. The conjugation of the mAbTCR23 antibody to saporin, a highly effective intracellular cytotoxic agent, did not affect the biological activity of the antibody. The mAbTCR23 – Saporin conjugate demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in a spectrum of cancer cell lines.  The Licensing Agreement is a critical milestone for Kyto and is the culmination of over 10 years of research and development funding provided by Kyto to the State University of New York (SUNY). The SUNY group based in Brooklyn and headed by Dr. Edward Quadros and Dr. Jeffrey Sequeira has been focused on targeting the Vitamin B 12 pathway for the treatment of cancer. Georges Benarroch, President and CEO of Kyto, complemented the SUNY scientists and RFSUNY for their invaluable contributions to and support of Kyto for over a decade. “Kyto is currently developing a humanized version of the mAbTCR23 antibody as it advances its candidate product towards the clinic”, stated Dr. Uri Sagman co-founder and COO of Kyto. “Efforts are also ongoing in engaging an industry partner to assist Kyto in developing our technology and in improving shareholder value”, added Dr. Sagman.  About Kyto Biopharma Inc.  Kyto Biopharma Inc. is a Florida based biotechnology company operating from Toronto, Canada, and developing monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The Kyto research and development program is conducted under the scientific leadership of Dr. Edward Quadros of the State University of New York (SUNY Brooklyn), and Dr. Michael Rosenblum of the MD Anderson Cancer Centre (Houston). Kyto owns a broad portfolio of intellectual property which includes the newly discovered Transcobalamin Receptor (TCbIR). The Company intends to develop its Vitamin B 12 receptor based technology and engage a suitable partner to assist with the development and commercialization of a marketable cancer therapeutic. Vitamin B 12 regulates one of two major cellular pathways for the production of Folates, the cell’s primary source of carbon and the progenitor for the synthesis of DNA. The newly isolated Transcobalamin receptor is over expressed in a host of various forms of cancer cells and serves as a viable target for development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.  Safe Harbor  This release contains forward looking statements that reflect, among other things, management’s current expectations, plans and strategies, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or predict. Please see “Risk Factors” in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of such risks, including the Company’s need for additional funds, the Company’s dependence on a limited number of therapeutic compounds , the stage of the products the Company is developing, uncertainties relating to clinical trials and regulatory reviews, competition and dependence on collaborative partners, the company’s ability to avoid infringement of the patent rights of others, and the company’s ability to obtain adequate patent protection and to enforce these rights. Because of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are released. Kyto Biopharma does not undertake any obligation to update or review any such forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Kyto Biopharma Inc. Weighs Strategic Options




















March 22, 2011 16:02 ET

 | Source: Kyto Biopharma Inc.





TORONTO, March 22, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kyto Biopharma Inc. (Pink Sheets:KBPH) ("Kyto") is a Florida-based development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing receptor medicated technologies to block the uptake of vitamin B12 by non-controlled proliferative cells (cancer), thereby inhibiting the cell's ability to replicate and the tumor's ability to grow, and targeted monoclonal antibody and drug delivery technologies to selectively kill solid tumor and blood borne cancer.

	Kyto has secured the support of its largest shareholders as well as of Credifinance Capital Corp. ("Credifinance"), its sole note holder, and has retained as its financial advisors and agents Bionest Partners ("Bionest") and the biotech arm of Waterford Investors Services, Health Care Capital Advisors ("HCCA").

	Georges Benarroch, President of Credifinance, also President & CEO of Kyto, indicated that this was part of Credifinance's shareholders request to review the various business lines and make an assessment of the U.S. holding company's overall strategy.

	"The mandate given to our advisors is to secure, for Kyto technological platform and IP portfolio, during this calendar year, the best possible strategic investor and/or partner who will understand that the Company has created a considerable and valuable patented portfolio of IP in the cancer field which, although at pre clinical stage, represents an opportunity to pursue very promising therapeutic solutions," said Dr. Uri Sagman, Kyto's COO.

	In view of the limited opportunities existing in the current environment for financing a company which has already spent several million dollars over the last 10 years, most of it provided by Credifinance, and which would require to get to the next stage a sizeable dilution to its shareholders only to face an uncertain valuation issue at a later stage, the board has decided to see how best it could maximize its shareholders' value and pursue the benefits of its licensing agreement.

About the Advisors:

Bionest, based in Paris, France, provides companies in the biotechnology sector with resources and advice on building business plans, developing relationships with strategic partners, and by acting as lead agent in capital fund raising.

Health Care Capital Advisors, based in Tampa, Florida, assists companies with raising capital and creating relationships in the healthcare sector.

	Both firms have a strong track record of successful business consultation, and successful fund raising efforts for biopharmaceutical firms from the start-up phase to mature multinational corporations.

About Kyto Biopharma Inc.

Kyto Biopharma Inc. is a Florida based biotechnology company operating from Toronto, Canada, developing monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The Kyto research and development program is conducted by the State University of New York (SUNY Brooklyn).

	Kyto is currently engaged in the development of a portfolio of potential targeted biologic treatments based on:

	i) Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) to target the delivery of cytotoxins to cancer cells via the coupling of saporin or other cytotoxic payloads to mAbs that are internalized after binding to the vitamin B12 receptor.

	ii) Monoclonal Antibodies (mABs) to block the vitamin B12 uptake to cancer cells.

	iii) siRNA, oligonucleotides designed to down-regulate/inhibit the cancer cells' ability to express the vitamin B12 receptor, leading to cell death.

	Vitamin B12 regulates one of two major cellular pathways for the production of folates, the progenitor for the synthesis of DNA. Cancer cells require increased levels of vitamin B12 for proliferation than do normal cells and, in turn, over-express the receptor for the uptake of vitamin B12.

	Kyto is targeting the over-expression of the vitamin B12 receptor in the treatment of various forms of cancer. The primary approach developed by Kyto is directed at selective targeting of the vitamin B12 receptor in cancer cells by monoclonal antibodies. The Kyto technology is intended to exploit over-expression of vitamin B12 receptors in cancer cells by coupling toxins (such as saporin) to monoclonal antibodies that directly target the vitamin B12 receptor and are internalized, thereby releasing the toxin directly within the tumor cells.

	Kyto's portfolio consists of molecules at the research and development stage which may ultimately prove useful in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Kyto believes that there are several human therapeutic applications for its drug candidates. Specifically, a number of properties of the Company's vitamin B12 depletion and monoclonal antibody technologies suggest a potential role for its drug candidates in the therapy of solid tumors, such as colorectal and breast cancer, in addition to the treatment of leukemia.

	KYTO BIOPHARMA, INC.






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December 31, 2016




	 




	NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF
	PRESENTATION




	 




	Kyto Biopharma, Inc. was formed as a Florida corporation on
	March 5, 1999. On August 14, 2002, the Company changed
	its name from B Twelve, Inc. to Kyto Biopharma, Inc.




	 




	The Company is a biopharmaceutical company,
	originally formed to acquire and develop innovative minimally toxic
	and non-immunosuppressive proprietary drugs for the treatment of
	cancer, arthritis, and other proliferate and autoimmune diseases.
	The Company is currently in the development stage and has disposed
	of its Research and Development in 2012 and is

	now

	in the process of looking at a number
	of strategies

	for acquisition and merger to

	become active. Once it has settled on the
	strategy, the Company will develop a plan for an acquisition and
	the means to achieve its goal.




	 




	USE OF ESTIMATES




	 




	In preparing financial statements, management is required to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
	assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues
	and expenses during the period presented. Actual results may differ
	from these estimates.




	 




	Significant estimates during 2016 include, the valuation allowance
	of deferred tax assets.




	 




	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 




	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
	maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
	cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31,
	2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. 




	 








	CONCENTRATIONS




	 




	The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at
	times, may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31,
	2016, the Company did not have any deposits in excess of federally
	insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
	accounts through December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016,
	respectively.




	 




	The Company has obtained and continues to obtain a large amount of
	its funding from loans and equity funding from a principal
	stockholder related to a director of the Company.




	 




	NOTE 2 – INTERIM REVIEW REPORTING




	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Kyto
	Biopharma, Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared pursuant to the
	rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the "SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally
	included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules
	and regulations. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the
	disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
	misleading. These interim unaudited condensed financial statements
	should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
	and notes thereto included in the Company's March 31, 2016 Annual
	Report as filed on Form 10K. In the opinion of management, all
	adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to
	present fairly the financial position of the Company with respect
	to the interim unaudited condensed financial statements and the
	results of its operations for the interim period ended December 31,
	2016, have been included. The results of operations for interim
	periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full
	year.

	KYTO BIOPHARMA, INC.




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December 31, 2016








	 




	NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN




	 




	As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
	statements, the Company has a working capital deficiency of
	$202,335, a deficit accumulated of $32,266,125, and a stockholders'
	deficit of $202,335 as of December 31, 2016. The ability of the
	Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
	Company's ability to devise a strategy and produces a business
	plan. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
	continue as a going concern.




	 




	The Company has yet to generate an internal cash flow, and until
	the sales of its product begins, the Company is highly dependent
	upon debt and equity funding. The Company must successfully
	complete its research and development resulting in a saleable
	product. However, there is no assurance that once the development
	of the product is completed and finally gains Federal Drug and
	Administration clearance, that the Company will achieve a
	profitable level of operations.





	 


	 





	NOTE
	4 - ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES




	Significant
	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	Management
	does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective,
	accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
	effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
	statements.

	ITEM 2.


	   
	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 




	PLAN OF OPERATION




	 








	The report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting firm
	dated June 29, 2016 on our March 31, 2016 financial
	statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there
	is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern due to substantial recurring losses from operations, cash
	used in operations, stockholders’ deficit, significant
	accumulated deficit and working capital deficit. Our ability to
	continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to
	obtain additional financing and maintain operations. Currently we
	do not have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations.
	Therefore, we need additional funds to continue these operations.
	The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that
	involves a number of factors, some of which are beyond
	management’s control, such as financial market trends and
	investors’ appetite for new financings. It should be
	emphasized that, should the Company not be successful in completing
	its own financing (either by debt or by the issuance of securities
	from treasury), the Company may be unable to continue to operate as
	a going concern.




	 








	Results of Operations




	 




	 For the three months ended December 31, 2016 the
	Company’s net loss attributable to common shareholders
	increase by $3,739 to $31,079 compared to a net loss of $27,340 for
	the three months ended December 31, 2015. 




	 




	For the nine months ended December 31, 2016 the Company’s net
	loss attributable to common shareholders decreased by $3,614 to
	$70,135 compared to a net loss of $66,521 for the nine months ended
	December 31, 2015. 




	 








	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	The Company had working capital deficits of $202,335 as of
	December 31,2016, and $132,200 as of March 31, 2016. Cash was
	$9 as of December 31,2016, and $32 as of March 31,
	2016.




	 




	Cash from operating activities




	 




	The
	Company’s net cash used in operations increased by $6,274 to
	$29,309 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 compared to net
	cash used in operations of $23,035 for the nine months ended
	December, 2015.




	Cash from financing activities




	 




	The Company’s net cash flows from financing activities
	increased by $6,224 to $29,286 for the nine months ended December
	31, 2016 compared to cash flows from financing activities of
	$23,062 for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.




	 




	The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months is
	to continue to focus its efforts on finding new sources of capital
	and on R&D activities related to the development and
	application of its antibody technologies. As of the date of filing
	of this Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission, the Company did receive a commitment of one of its
	stockholders to continue to provide operating loan funds to the
	Company.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
	ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our
	periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
	as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
	reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
	and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and
	communicated to our management, including our chief executive
	officer/chief financial officer (principal financial officer) as
	appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure. During the quarter ended December 31, 2016 we carried
	out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
	of our management, including the principal executive officer and
	the principal financial officer (principal financial officer), of
	the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under
	the 1934 Act. Based on this evaluation, because of the
	Company’s limited resources and limited number of employees,
	management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were ineffective as of December 31, 2016.




	Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
	Procedures




	Our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer (principal financial officer), does not expect
	that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
	controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,
	no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
	reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
	control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
	must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
	benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
	evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
	control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
	have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not
	limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
	faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
	mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
	individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
	people, or by management override of the control. The design of any
	system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
	about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance
	that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
	all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
	compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
	of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
	misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
	detected.




	Internal Controls over Financial Reporting




	During
	the quarter ended December 31, 2016, there have been no changes in
	our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
	affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
	controls over financial reporting.
