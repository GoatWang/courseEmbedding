What We Make












Back to Top



How We Make It


We use renewable feedstocks (sugars) instead of fossil fuels and apply industrial biotechnology (fermentation) using our proprietary yeast, which consumes sugar and CO2 to produce succinic acid. We then recover and purify the succinic acid and use conventional chemistry to convert the succinic acid into 1,4 Butanediol and disodium succinate.




We can use any type of sugar (C6 or C5) as feedstock
Our yeast is very efficient at producing succinic acid
CO2 is our other feedstock – providing roughly 25% of the carbon in succinic acid
Our succinic acid is 100% bio-based

Bio-based 1,4Butanediol




A GREEN VERSION OF A WIDELY USED CHEMICAL THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE
BioAmber can transform its bio-based Succinic acid into 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a single catalytic step. BDO and THF are used to make engineering plastics, polyurethanes, biodegradable polyesters, spandex and other specialty chemicals.  We make exactly the same chemical. It is a straight drop in for existing BDO and THF consumers, but is bio-based, rather than being petroleum based, providing the products made with our BDO and THF a better environmental footprint.

Bio-basedDisodiumSuccinate




AN ALL NATURAL SEASONING AND FLAVOR ENHANCER FOR USE IN FOODS
BioAmber bio-based disodium succinate is an important ingredient of complex seasoning agents that can be used as an alternative for flavor enhancement and salt replacement. For its production, BioAmber's natural flavor grade bio-based succinic acid is neutralized and spray dried to a tight particle size distribution. This natural ingredient can be used with other flavors and enhancers to either intensify flavor or soften stimulating strong tastes. It has good water solubility and high penetration and as a result, these effects are accelerated. BioAmber’s bio-based disodium succinate is an anhydrous powder with low particle size, making it ideal for blending in dry seasonings.

Sustainability Life Cycle Analysis
A Carbon Neutral Footprint


BioAmber is committed to producing chemicals in a more environmentally responsible manner.  By using renewable feedstock, eliminating green house gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption, we are practicing greener chemistry that is sustainable.  When our Sarnia plant begins production in 2015, it will have an impressive carbon footprint relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum.   Our bio-based process for making succinic acid will result in a 100% reduction in green house gas emissions and a 60% reduction in energy consumption. 

An independent life cycle analysis, which evaluated the entire production chain from the planting and harvesting of corn through to the purification of succinic acid, revealed that net green house gas emissions for our entire process is zero.  This represents a 100% reduction relative to the 7.1 tons of greenhouse gases that are emitted per ton of succinic acid produced using the petroleum process.   At full capacity (30,000 tons of succinic acid per year), our Sarnia facility will reduce green house gas emissions by over 210,000 tons per year, relative to the petroleum process.  This is the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road each year.  The life cycle analysis also revealed that our entire process (corn to succinic) uses 60% less energy than the petroleum-derived process, a savings of over 2 trillion BTUs per year.  That is the equivalent to the energy consumed by 46,000 US homes annually.

Sustainability feedstock development
Feedstock Flexibility


BioAmber is focused on using the most abundant, low cost sugar available, but we are also conscious of the need to be as sustainable as possible. Today, North American corn offers the most competitively priced sugar, making our succinic acid even more cost competitive.  We can also use sugar from cane, beets, sorghum, wheat and tapioca to produce succinic acid.  Our longer-term goal is to move to agricultural, forestry and eventually industrial waste as alternatives to traditional sugars.

While these second and third generation sugars are not commercially available today, BioAmber is working to ensure it has the flexibility to move to these alternative feedstocks when they become economical and available in commercial quantities.  Our proprietary yeast developed with Cargill has the ability to efficiently consume xylose, the principal sugar that is obtained from hemi-cellulose, a major component of agricultural and forestry waste.  We are actively screening sugars produced by various new technologies in an effort to determine those that will offer legitimate alternatives to first generation sugars.  We are also engaged in a research program with Canada’s National Research Counsel that is developing a new organism that can consume methane or methanol instead of sugar and produce succinic acid.  Methane and methanol are expected to be widely available and inexpensive byproducts of the shale gas boom.

History[edit]
BioAmber was established in 2008 as a result of a spin-off from New York-based Diversified Natural Products (DNP). The company was originally named DNP Green Technology and was based in Princeton, New Jersey.[5] Prior to the spin-off, DNP had established a joint venture with France-based Agro-Industrie Recherches et Développements (ARD) to develop and commercialize bio-based succinic acid. In 2010, DNP Green Technology acquired 100 percent of the joint venture from ARD and changed its corporate name to BioAmber.[6]
After the Company was spun off from DNP, it was privately financed in 2009 by a group of institutional investors led by Sofinnova Partners, Mitsui & Co., Samsung Ventures and the Cliffton Group.[7] In 2011 and 2012, Naxos Capital Partners and Lanxess became investors in the Company, which raised a total of $87 million over three rounds of financing between 2009[8] and 2012.[9] In May 2013, BioAmber completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BIOA, raising $80 million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional $44 million in common stock.[10]
Technology[edit]
BioAmber produces bio-based succinic acid by fermenting sugars. The company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from Cargill. Cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low pH. Cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since 2009.[11] BioAmber collaborated with Cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low pH and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid, giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation. BioAmber has designed its commercial plant in Sarnia for the production of bio-based succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology.[12]
BioAmber has licensed from Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies a catalyst technology that converts bio-based succinic acid into bio-based 1,4-butanediol (BDO).[13] The technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into BDO and tetrahydrofuran (THF).[14] JM Davy is reportedly the global leader in BDO and THF technology, with 14 licenses deployed representing approximately 800,000 tons per year of installed BDO and THF capacity, or 25% of worldwide capacity.[15] Their technology currently produces BDO/THF from maleic anhydride, a petrochemical. The first step in that route converts MA to succinic acid; thus succinic is an alternative feedstock. JM Davy has adjusted its process and tested BioAmber's bio-succinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance, process economics or product quality.[15]
Sustainability[edit]
The use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals.
Manufacturing[edit]
BioAmber produced bio-based succinic acid from January 2010 to December 2014 at a large demonstration plant owned and operated by the Company’s former joint venture partner, ARD.[16] The demonstration plant operated at the 350,000 liter fermenter scale, which at the time was one of the largest scale fermentations among start-up companies in the field of bio-based chemicals.[17] BioAmber claim to have gained extensive experience from operating this plant for five years and incorporated the learning and improvements into the design of its commercial plant in Sarnia, Canada.[18]
BioAmber established a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. to build and operate a bio-succinic acid plant in Sarnia, Ontario with a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 metric tons (66,000,000 lb) per year,[19] with BioAmber owning 60% of the venture.[20] The facility began construction in August 2013 and began commercial operations in November 2015.[21] The cost of construction was US$141 million and it created 60 full-time jobs.[21] It is the world’s largest bio-based succinic acid plant.[22]
BioAmber's Integrated Management Systems in Sarnia were ISO 9001:2008 registered, ISO 14001:2004 registered, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 registered, and FSSC 22000 registered within four months of operational start-up.[23]
Markets[edit]
Succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets, from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives, to large volume applications such as bioplastics, pigments, plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings.[24] In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) published a report on “Top Value-Added Chemicals from Biomass,” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass. The study prioritized twelve chemicals, from a group of over 300 possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars. Bio-succinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential.[25]
Historically, the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients. As a result, based on 2011 estimates, the market for petroleum-based succinic acid was approximately 51,000 metric tons per year, representing a market size of approximately $350 million.[24] However, market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing bio-succinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications. A study published in September 2013 by Transparency Market Research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a CAGR of 19.4% between 2012 and 2018.[26] A study published in August 2012 by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 25% and 30% through 2020, when the global market size is expected to be between 500,000 and 700,000 metric tons.[24]
The major uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT.[27] THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics. PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines excellent mechanical and electrical properties with robust chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Global 1,4-butanediol market size was estimated at US$4.72 billion in 2013.[28]

BioAmber established a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. to build and operate a bio-succinic acid plant in Sarnia, Ontario with a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 metric tons (66,000,000 lb) per year,[19] with BioAmber owning 60% of the venture.[20] The facility began construction in August 2013 and began commercial operations in November 2015.[21] The cost of construction was US$141 million and it created 60 full-time jobs.[21] It is the world’s largest bio-based succinic acid plant.[22]
BioAmber's Integrated Management Systems in Sarnia were ISO 9001:2008 registered, ISO 14001:2004 registered, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 registered, and FSSC 22000 registered within four months of operational start-up.[23]
Markets[edit]
Succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets, from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives, to large volume applications such as bioplastics, pigments, plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings.[24] In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) published a report on “Top Value-Added Chemicals from Biomass,” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass. The study prioritized twelve chemicals, from a group of over 300 possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars. Bio-succinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential.[25]
Historically, the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients. As a result, based on 2011 estimates, the market for petroleum-based succinic acid was approximately 51,000 metric tons per year, representing a market size of approximately $350 million.[24] However, market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing bio-succinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications. A study published in September 2013 by Transparency Market Research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a CAGR of 19.4% between 2012 and 2018.[26] A study published in August 2012 by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 25% and 30% through 2020, when the global market size is expected to be between 500,000 and 700,000 metric tons.[24]
The major uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT.[27] THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics. PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines excellent mechanical and electrical properties with robust chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Global 1,4-butanediol market size was estimated at US$4.72 billion in 2013.[28]

History[edit]
BioAmber was established in 2008 as a result of a spin-off from New York-based Diversified Natural Products (DNP). The company was originally named DNP Green Technology and was based in Princeton, New Jersey.[5] Prior to the spin-off, DNP had established a joint venture with France-based Agro-Industrie Recherches et Développements (ARD) to develop and commercialize bio-based succinic acid. In 2010, DNP Green Technology acquired 100 percent of the joint venture from ARD and changed its corporate name to BioAmber.[6]
After the Company was spun off from DNP, it was privately financed in 2009 by a group of institutional investors led by Sofinnova Partners, Mitsui & Co., Samsung Ventures and the Cliffton Group.[7] In 2011 and 2012, Naxos Capital Partners and Lanxess became investors in the Company, which raised a total of $87 million over three rounds of financing between 2009[8] and 2012.[9] In May 2013, BioAmber completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BIOA, raising $80 million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional $44 million in common stock.[10]
Technology[edit]
BioAmber produces bio-based succinic acid by fermenting sugars. The company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from Cargill. Cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low pH. Cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since 2009.[11] BioAmber collaborated with Cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low pH and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid, giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation. BioAmber has designed its commercial plant in Sarnia for the production of bio-based succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology.[12]
BioAmber has licensed from Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies a catalyst technology that converts bio-based succinic acid into bio-based 1,4-butanediol (BDO).[13] The technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into BDO and tetrahydrofuran (THF).[14] JM Davy is reportedly the global leader in BDO and THF technology, with 14 licenses deployed representing approximately 800,000 tons per year of installed BDO and THF capacity, or 25% of worldwide capacity.[15] Their technology currently produces BDO/THF from maleic anhydride, a petrochemical. The first step in that route converts MA to succinic acid; thus succinic is an alternative feedstock. JM Davy has adjusted its process and tested BioAmber's bio-succinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance, process economics or product quality.[15]
Sustainability[edit]
The use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals.

BioAmber produced bio-based succinic acid from January 2010 to December 2014 at a large demonstration plant owned and operated by the Company’s former joint venture partner, ARD.[16] The demonstration plant operated at the 350,000 liter fermenter scale, which at the time was one of the largest scale fermentations among start-up companies in the field of bio-based chemicals.[17] BioAmber claim to have gained extensive experience from operating this plant for five years and incorporated the learning and improvements into the design of its commercial plant in Sarnia, Canada.[18]
BioAmber established a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. to build and operate a bio-succinic acid plant in Sarnia, Ontario with a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 metric tons (66,000,000 lb) per year,[19] with BioAmber owning 60% of the venture.[20] The facility began construction in August 2013 and began commercial operations in November 2015.[21] The cost of construction was US$141 million and it created 60 full-time jobs.[21] It is the world’s largest bio-based succinic acid plant.[22]
BioAmber's Integrated Management Systems in Sarnia were ISO 9001:2008 registered, ISO 14001:2004 registered, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 registered, and FSSC 22000 registered within four months of operational start-up.[23]
Markets[edit]
Succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets, from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives, to large volume applications such as bioplastics, pigments, plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings.[24] In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) published a report on “Top Value-Added Chemicals from Biomass,” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass. The study prioritized twelve chemicals, from a group of over 300 possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars. Bio-succinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential.[25]
Historically, the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients. As a result, based on 2011 estimates, the market for petroleum-based succinic acid was approximately 51,000 metric tons per year, representing a market size of approximately $350 million.[24] However, market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing bio-succinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications. A study published in September 2013 by Transparency Market Research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a CAGR of 19.4% between 2012 and 2018.[26] A study published in August 2012 by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 25% and 30% through 2020, when the global market size is expected to be between 500,000 and 700,000 metric tons.[24]
The major uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT.[27] THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics. PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines excellent mechanical and electrical properties with robust chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Global 1,4-butanediol market size was estimated at US$4.72 billion in 2013.[28]

History[edit]
BioAmber was established in 2008 as a result of a spin-off from New York-based Diversified Natural Products (DNP). The company was originally named DNP Green Technology and was based in Princeton, New Jersey.[5] Prior to the spin-off, DNP had established a joint venture with France-based Agro-Industrie Recherches et Développements (ARD) to develop and commercialize bio-based succinic acid. In 2010, DNP Green Technology acquired 100 percent of the joint venture from ARD and changed its corporate name to BioAmber.[6]
After the Company was spun off from DNP, it was privately financed in 2009 by a group of institutional investors led by Sofinnova Partners, Mitsui & Co., Samsung Ventures and the Cliffton Group.[7] In 2011 and 2012, Naxos Capital Partners and Lanxess became investors in the Company, which raised a total of $87 million over three rounds of financing between 2009[8] and 2012.[9] In May 2013, BioAmber completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BIOA, raising $80 million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional $44 million in common stock.[10]
Technology[edit]
BioAmber produces bio-based succinic acid by fermenting sugars. The company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from Cargill. Cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low pH. Cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since 2009.[11] BioAmber collaborated with Cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low pH and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid, giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation. BioAmber has designed its commercial plant in Sarnia for the production of bio-based succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology.[12]
BioAmber has licensed from Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies a catalyst technology that converts bio-based succinic acid into bio-based 1,4-butanediol (BDO).[13] The technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into BDO and tetrahydrofuran (THF).[14] JM Davy is reportedly the global leader in BDO and THF technology, with 14 licenses deployed representing approximately 800,000 tons per year of installed BDO and THF capacity, or 25% of worldwide capacity.[15] Their technology currently produces BDO/THF from maleic anhydride, a petrochemical. The first step in that route converts MA to succinic acid; thus succinic is an alternative feedstock. JM Davy has adjusted its process and tested BioAmber's bio-succinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance, process economics or product quality.[15]

The use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals.

BioAmber produced bio-based succinic acid from January 2010 to December 2014 at a large demonstration plant owned and operated by the Company’s former joint venture partner, ARD.[16] The demonstration plant operated at the 350,000 liter fermenter scale, which at the time was one of the largest scale fermentations among start-up companies in the field of bio-based chemicals.[17] BioAmber claim to have gained extensive experience from operating this plant for five years and incorporated the learning and improvements into the design of its commercial plant in Sarnia, Canada.[18]
BioAmber established a joint venture with Mitsui & Co. to build and operate a bio-succinic acid plant in Sarnia, Ontario with a manufacturing capacity of 30,000 metric tons (66,000,000 lb) per year,[19] with BioAmber owning 60% of the venture.[20] The facility began construction in August 2013 and began commercial operations in November 2015.[21] The cost of construction was US$141 million and it created 60 full-time jobs.[21] It is the world’s largest bio-based succinic acid plant.[22]
BioAmber's Integrated Management Systems in Sarnia were ISO 9001:2008 registered, ISO 14001:2004 registered, BS OHSAS 18001:2007 registered, and FSSC 22000 registered within four months of operational start-up.[23]
Markets[edit]
Succinic acid is a platform chemical that can be used in a broad range of markets, from high value niche applications such as personal care products and food additives, to large volume applications such as bioplastics, pigments, plasticizers, polyurethanes, resins and coatings.[24] In 2004, the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) published a report on “Top Value-Added Chemicals from Biomass,” identifying the top opportunities for the production of chemicals from biomass. The study prioritized twelve chemicals, from a group of over 300 possible building blocks that could be most effectively manufactured from sugars. Bio-succinic acid was recognized as one of the renewable building block chemicals with the greatest technical feasibility and commercial potential.[25]
Historically, the high cost of producing succinic acid from petroleum feedstock limited its use to a narrow range of applications such as pharmaceuticals and food ingredients. As a result, based on 2011 estimates, the market for petroleum-based succinic acid was approximately 51,000 metric tons per year, representing a market size of approximately $350 million.[24] However, market research firms and consultants predict that manufacturing bio-succinic acid will make succinic acid economically feasible for use in greater volumes across a spectrum of new applications. A study published in September 2013 by Transparency Market Research projects that the global market for succinic acid will grow at a CAGR of 19.4% between 2012 and 2018.[26] A study published in August 2012 by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants projects that the succinic acid market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of between 25% and 30% through 2020, when the global market size is expected to be between 500,000 and 700,000 metric tons.[24]
The major uses of 1,4 BDO are in the production of THF and polybutylene terephthalate, or PBT.[27] THF is used to produce spandex fibers and other performance polymers, resins, solvents and printing inks for plastics. PBT is an engineering-grade thermoplastic that combines excellent mechanical and electrical properties with robust chemical resistance. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on PBT to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Global 1,4-butanediol market size was estimated at US$4.72 billion in 2013.[28]

History[edit]
BioAmber was established in 2008 as a result of a spin-off from New York-based Diversified Natural Products (DNP). The company was originally named DNP Green Technology and was based in Princeton, New Jersey.[5] Prior to the spin-off, DNP had established a joint venture with France-based Agro-Industrie Recherches et Développements (ARD) to develop and commercialize bio-based succinic acid. In 2010, DNP Green Technology acquired 100 percent of the joint venture from ARD and changed its corporate name to BioAmber.[6]
After the Company was spun off from DNP, it was privately financed in 2009 by a group of institutional investors led by Sofinnova Partners, Mitsui & Co., Samsung Ventures and the Cliffton Group.[7] In 2011 and 2012, Naxos Capital Partners and Lanxess became investors in the Company, which raised a total of $87 million over three rounds of financing between 2009[8] and 2012.[9] In May 2013, BioAmber completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BIOA, raising $80 million in gross proceeds and issuing warrants for an additional $44 million in common stock.[10]
Technology[edit]
BioAmber produces bio-based succinic acid by fermenting sugars. The company uses a proprietary yeast that it has exclusively licensed from Cargill. Cargill originally identified a yeast strain that has the ability to ferment at a low pH. Cargill modified that strain for the production of lactic acid and has been using that new yeast strain at commercial scale since 2009.[11] BioAmber collaborated with Cargill to develop from the original strain a new one that could ferment at a low pH and tolerate high concentrations of succinic acid, giving it a distinct advantage over other microorganisms producing succinic acid via fermentation. BioAmber has designed its commercial plant in Sarnia for the production of bio-based succinic acid to operate with its yeast technology.[12]
BioAmber has licensed from Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies a catalyst technology that converts bio-based succinic acid into bio-based 1,4-butanediol (BDO).[13] The technology involves the vapor phase hydrogenation of succinic acid ester into BDO and tetrahydrofuran (THF).[14] JM Davy is reportedly the global leader in BDO and THF technology, with 14 licenses deployed representing approximately 800,000 tons per year of installed BDO and THF capacity, or 25% of worldwide capacity.[15] Their technology currently produces BDO/THF from maleic anhydride, a petrochemical. The first step in that route converts MA to succinic acid; thus succinic is an alternative feedstock. JM Davy has adjusted its process and tested BioAmber's bio-succinic acid so it can substitute maleic anhydride without impacting performance, process economics or product quality.[15]
Sustainability[edit]
The use of fermentation to produce building block chemicals offers the prospect of an improved carbon footprint and lower energy intensity than the petrochemical route to the same chemicals.

Bio-basedSuccinicAcid






A renewable building blockthat can be used to make a wide range of products
Succinic acid is the core product produced by BioAmber. Succinic acid can be used to make a broad range of products found in everyday life, including polyurethanes, paints and coatings, adhesives, sealants, artificial leathers, food and flavor additives, cosmetics and personal care products, biodegradable plastics, nylons, industrial lubricants, phthalate-free plasticizers, dyes & pigments and pharmaceutical compounds.

Bio-based 1,4Butanediol




A GREEN VERSION OF A WIDELY USED CHEMICAL THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE
BioAmber can transform its bio-based Succinic acid into 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a single catalytic step. BDO and THF are used to make engineering plastics, polyurethanes, biodegradable polyesters, spandex and other specialty chemicals.  We make exactly the same chemical. It is a straight drop in for existing BDO and THF consumers, but is bio-based, rather than being petroleum based, providing the products made with our BDO and THF a better environmental footprint.

Bio-basedDisodiumSuccinate




AN ALL NATURAL SEASONING AND FLAVOR ENHANCER FOR USE IN FOODS
BioAmber bio-based disodium succinate is an important ingredient of complex seasoning agents that can be used as an alternative for flavor enhancement and salt replacement. For its production, BioAmber's natural flavor grade bio-based succinic acid is neutralized and spray dried to a tight particle size distribution. This natural ingredient can be used with other flavors and enhancers to either intensify flavor or soften stimulating strong tastes. It has good water solubility and high penetration and as a result, these effects are accelerated. BioAmber’s bio-based disodium succinate is an anhydrous powder with low particle size, making it ideal for blending in dry seasonings.

Sustainability Life Cycle Analysis
A Carbon Neutral Footprint


BioAmber is committed to producing chemicals in a more environmentally responsible manner.  By using renewable feedstock, eliminating green house gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption, we are practicing greener chemistry that is sustainable.  When our Sarnia plant begins production in 2015, it will have an impressive carbon footprint relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum.   Our bio-based process for making succinic acid will result in a 100% reduction in green house gas emissions and a 60% reduction in energy consumption. 

An independent life cycle analysis, which evaluated the entire production chain from the planting and harvesting of corn through to the purification of succinic acid, revealed that net green house gas emissions for our entire process is zero.  This represents a 100% reduction relative to the 7.1 tons of greenhouse gases that are emitted per ton of succinic acid produced using the petroleum process.   At full capacity (30,000 tons of succinic acid per year), our Sarnia facility will reduce green house gas emissions by over 210,000 tons per year, relative to the petroleum process.  This is the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road each year.  The life cycle analysis also revealed that our entire process (corn to succinic) uses 60% less energy than the petroleum-derived process, a savings of over 2 trillion BTUs per year.  That is the equivalent to the energy consumed by 46,000 US homes annually.

Sustainability feedstock development
Feedstock Flexibility


BioAmber is focused on using the most abundant, low cost sugar available, but we are also conscious of the need to be as sustainable as possible. Today, North American corn offers the most competitively priced sugar, making our succinic acid even more cost competitive.  We can also use sugar from cane, beets, sorghum, wheat and tapioca to produce succinic acid.  Our longer-term goal is to move to agricultural, forestry and eventually industrial waste as alternatives to traditional sugars.

While these second and third generation sugars are not commercially available today, BioAmber is working to ensure it has the flexibility to move to these alternative feedstocks when they become economical and available in commercial quantities.  Our proprietary yeast developed with Cargill has the ability to efficiently consume xylose, the principal sugar that is obtained from hemi-cellulose, a major component of agricultural and forestry waste.  We are actively screening sugars produced by various new technologies in an effort to determine those that will offer legitimate alternatives to first generation sugars.  We are also engaged in a research program with Canada’s National Research Counsel that is developing a new organism that can consume methane or methanol instead of sugar and produce succinic acid.  Methane and methanol are expected to be widely available and inexpensive byproducts of the shale gas boom.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.40      Net Money Flow ($)  9,087    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.

What We Make












Back to Top



How We Make It


We use renewable feedstocks (sugars) instead of fossil fuels and apply industrial biotechnology (fermentation) using our proprietary yeast, which consumes sugar and CO2 to produce succinic acid. We then recover and purify the succinic acid and use conventional chemistry to convert the succinic acid into 1,4 Butanediol and disodium succinate.




We can use any type of sugar (C6 or C5) as feedstock
Our yeast is very efficient at producing succinic acid
CO2 is our other feedstock – providing roughly 25% of the carbon in succinic acid
Our succinic acid is 100% bio-based

Unit of Measure:

Metric tonnes
