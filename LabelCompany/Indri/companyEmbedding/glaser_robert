Robert Glaser, Who Shaped the Science of Student Testing, Dies at 91

Robert Glaser, a cognitive psychologist who helped define the terms of the national debate over student testing, and who pioneered ways of measuring not only how students learn but how teachers teach, died on Feb. 4 in Pittsburgh. He was 91.The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, said a spokesman for the University of Pittsburgh Learning Research and Development Center, which Dr. Glaser helped found in 1963.Dr. Glaser was probably best known for promoting a kind of standardized test that became the norm for the federal government’s National Assessment of Educational Progress, the state-by-state evaluation commonly known as The Nation’s Report Card.The method, which he did not invent but championed, and coined as “criterion-referenced testing,” measured not just what students knew but how well they were learning. Rather than measuring students in comparison with one another, as I.Q. and other traditional standardized tests do, “criterion” tests were mainly designed to compare students’ results with their own previous test results. While not obviously different from traditional tests like the SATs — which the Report Card used at first — Dr. Glaser argued successfully that criterion tests were the more nimble tool for helping teachers adjust lessons to their students’ needs.

It became the standard testing system for the periodic “Report Cards” exams in math, reading, history and science given to 4th, 8th and 12th graders throughout the country. Continue reading the main story

Dr. Glaser was equally resolute, though less successful, in warning about the limits of testing.In 1987, when the Department of Education asked the National Academy of Education to critique the Report Card system, Dr. Glaser was named chairman of the academy’s review panel. In a report that called test results “fallible and partial indicators of academic achievement,” the panel warned educators to avoid letting them become “the major goals of schooling.”Diane Ravitch, a policy analyst and historian of education who quoted Dr. Glaser’s report in her 2010 book, “The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education,” described Dr. Glaser as one of his generation’s most respected, and far-sighted, experts on testing.“No one understood testing as well as Bob Glaser did, and what he said in 1987 was prescient,” she said in an interview. Referring to an increase in standardized testing under the federal No Child Left Behind law, she added, “I don’t think he would like what’s happening today.”Colleagues and family said Dr. Glaser had had Alzheimer’s disease for many years and was unable to give his opinion on current trends in standardized testing. But his views about the science of education, they said, changed the field and influenced the work of three generations of researchers.

“He was one of the first to use testing to measure how we should be teaching, not just to sort” high and low achievers, said Lauren B. Resnick, a psychology professor and former head of the learning research center that Dr. Glaser helped found.Dr. Glaser focused on the process by which people learn: How do people evolve from novices to experts in their fields, whether as physicists or cabdrivers? What are low achievers missing when they read or hear someone talk? What could help them to get it?In the universe of cognitive science, Dr. Glaser was known for encouraging his students and other researchers to develop what he called “a unified theory of learning” — one that would measure student, teacher and curriculum, then use the findings to make each of them better.

It was important to strive for that ambitious goal, “even if we accept that it will be difficult to achieve,” he wrote in one of the last of his 220 published articles. Drawing on an educational theory at least as old as the sayings of Confucius, he added, “Learning is driven by failure.”

Robert Glaser was born on Jan. 18, 1921, in Providence, R.I., and grew up in the Bronx, one of two children of Abe and Rose Glaser. His father, a successful furrier during Robert’s early life, suffered business reversals when Robert was a student at New York University. Abe Glaser became a traveling salesman, and Robert enrolled at City College.In the Army during World War II, he helped conduct psychological testing on trainees for bomber crews. He and his wife, Sylvia, met as graduate students at Indiana University, where both studied under the celebrated behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, who became a professor at Harvard. Mr. Glaser received his Ph.D. in psychology at Indiana and in 1956 became an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, where he remained for the rest of his career.His survivors include two daughters, Karen Glaser and Ellen DeBenedetti; two grandchildren; a great-grandchild; and a sister, Irma Kemp. Dr. Glaser’s wife died in 2001.Dr. Glaser was initially a disciple of Professor Skinner’s, embracing the view that learning is a process of behavior modification that is not fundamentally different from teaching rats to press a lever to score food pellets.But Dr. Glaser developed his own learning theories and a broader view of the mission of education. Dr. Ravitch said he articulated them in the 1987 report for the National Academy of Education, which she called “vintage Glaser.”The report said the goal of education should be not only informational but also “aesthetic and moral.” It should aim to equip people with “resilience and courage in the face of stress, a sense of craft in our work, a commitment to justice and caring in our social relationships, a dedication to advancing the public good.”The most sophisticated standardized test, it concluded, would find those cognitive skills “extremely difficult to assess.”

Before founding RealNetworks, he had become a millionaire by working for Microsoft for ten years.

Glaser is a graduate of Yale University with an BS degree in Computer Science and an MA in Economics.
On June 16, 2004, Glaser received the Music Visionary Award, along with EMI Vice Chairman David Munns, from the Music for Youth Foundation, and the United Jewish Appeal.[5]

Since June 2010, Glaser has been a partner at global venture firm, Accel Partners, focusing on digital media technology, social media, and mobile service investments.[12] Returning to RealNetworks again as CEO[13] and he is no longer listed on the Accel.com website.
