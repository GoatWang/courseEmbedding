 Board of Directors



 

The Board of Directors, together with Eaton Vance Trust Company (the “Trustee”), maintain ultimate control over all aspects of the operations of the U.S. Charitable Gift Trust (the “Trust”). A majority of the Directors are unaffiliated with Eaton Vance Management (“Eaton Vance”), the Trustee or Renaissance Administration LLC (the “Administrator”). Vacancies on the Board of Directors are filled by the remaining Board members. A majority of the independent Board members must concur on the appointment of a new independent Director. Donors do not have voting rights or the right to participate in the selection of Directors. The current Directors are as follows:

Kathleen L. Ames, Director of Mary W. Harriman Foundation, Brookline Education Foundation, and the Ralph Lowell Society of WGBH. Life Trustee, Concord Academy, Concord, Massachusetts. Former chair, Brookline School Committee. 
Jeffrey P. Beale, Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Eaton Vance Corp. Trustee, Peabody Essex Museum. President of the Board of Directors, First Literacy Boston. Co-chair, Dana-Farber Leadership Council. 
E. Michael Brown, retired Managing Director of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Ltd. Former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Newton Wellesley Hospital and Newell Health Care System. 
James B. Hawkes, retired Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Vance Corp. Retired Trustee and/or officer of numerous Eaton Vance investment companies. Trustee, U.S.S. Constitution Museum. Trustee, Peabody Essex Museum. 
Kate Leness, Partner/Owner of Fund Liquidation Solutions. Chair, Quogue Field Club Junior Sports Camp. Board Member, Brookline Education Foundation. Overseer, Boston Children’s Museum. Treasurer, Runkle School PTO. Treasurer, Brookline Youth Lacrosse. Trustee, TBG Trust.
James M. Storey, Former Trustee of various organizations and corporations, and a practicing attorney. Formerly, a Partner of the law firm of Dechert, LLC (1987-1993).
 
The Board of Directors appoints and oversees the performance and compensation of all service providers, approves grants, approves the investment in and investment guidelines for the investment funds, and takes actions to maintain the charitable status of the Trust under federal law. 
Officers. In addition to delegating certain operating functions to Eaton Vance and the Administrator, the Board of Directors has appointed certain officers to take actions on behalf of the Trust. The officers, each of whom is an officer of Eaton Vance, are as follows: Jeffrey P. Beale, President; Stephanie Rosander, Secretary; Matthew Manning, Assistant Secretary; Peter Crowley, Vice President; James Kirchner, Treasurer; and Michael Shattuck, Assistant Treasurer.
Limitation of Liability. The Directors will not have liability under the declaration of trust for their actions or omissions, nor for actions or omissions of the Trust’s officers, employees or agents to whom administrative or investment authority may be delegated, except as may be caused by the Directors’ bad faith or reckless indifference in the performance of their duties. The Trust maintains insurance policies to protect the Trust, the Board and the officers.
The Trust will indemnify the Directors against any liability to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. The Trust may also indemnify and hold harmless certain service providers, their agents, and nominees from any claims, losses, liabilities, or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), except as they may arise from gross negligence or reckless indifference in the performance of their duties.
Auditors. The Board of Directors has selected the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as independent accountants of the Trust and its pooled income funds. The Board of Directors has the right to change auditors in its sole discretion.
Trustee. Eaton Vance Trust Company (“EVTC”) currently serves as Trustee of the Trust. Chartered in Maine in 2004, EVTC is a non-depository trust company with a principal place of business in Boston, Massachusetts that provides personal and investment trust services. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. The Trustee does not have any liability for its actions or omissions, except to the extent that such actions or inactions constitute bad faith or reckless indifference in the performance of its duties.
