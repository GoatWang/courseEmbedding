Performance wear for the workplace









Performance wear for the workplace
Our mission is to ¨combine¨ technology and fashion to improve the way we wear and take care of our clothes without compromising on the look and feel. 
Our clothing is made with “smart” textiles. Our shirts are for example smell and odour repellent. If you have a stain during the day it’s very easy to rinse off, big sweat stains are a problem of the past and washing is only needed after a couple of wears.  The fabric is just from normal cotton and it feels very natural. We can do this because the technology is applied to the fibres, even before it’s spun into fabric.
A lot has happened within performance tech the past years. The sports brands are leading the way, while the fashion industry is slow to adapt. The fashion houses go for new trends to increase sales. Often produced in bad quality and for very low prices what has turned fashion into a disposable product. Prices might have gone done but it hasn’t become cheaper to produce and the people in the low wage countries are feeling the consequences. We want to help fight that “fast” fashion by creating timeless basics that will last longer. “Choose better, buy less”.
We launched our stain & odour repellent dress shirts on Kickstarter and sold 1,542 of them in 28 days. In total, we raised €150.000,-.
