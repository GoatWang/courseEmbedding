Mission

 



Creating Value Through People
American Woodmark is an organization of employees and shareholders who have combined their resources to pursue a common goal.


What We Do
Our common goal is to create value by providing kitchens and baths of pride for the American family.
Why We Do It
We pursue this goal to earn a profit, which allows us to reward our shareholders and employees, and to make a contribution to our society.
How We Do It
Four principles guide our actions:

Customer Satisfaction
Providing the best possible quality, service and value to the greatest number of people. Doing whatever is reasonable, and sometimes unreasonable, to make certain that each customer’s needs are met each and every day.
Integrity
Doing what is right. Caring about the dignity and rights of each individual. Acting fairly and responsibly with all parties. Being a good citizen in the communities in which we operate.
Teamwork
Understanding that we must all work together if we are to be successful. Realizing that each individual must contribute to the team to remain a member of the team.
Excellence
Striving to perform every job or action in a superior way. Being innovative, seeking new and better ways to get things done. Helping all individuals to become the best that they can be in their jobs and careers.



Once We’ve Done It
When we achieve our goal, good things happen: sales increase, profits are made, shareholders and employees are rewarded, jobs are created, our communities benefit, we have fun, and our customers are happy and proud—with a new kitchen or bath from American Woodmark.


 
 
 




Community

 



As a national enterprise with roots in neighborhoods across America, we’re closely involved with our communities. We have a long history of outreach programs focused on sustaining our communities, helping charitable organizations fulfill their missions, and simply being good neighbors.

In 1995, the Board of Directors launched the American Woodmark Foundation, an employee-run organization that coordinates the company’s charitable giving activities. 
The foundation’s primary giving areas include: education, housing, fire and safety, domestic violence, and providing funds for operating expenses. 
The foundation is active in the communities in which the company operates. Teams, composed of both salaried and hourly employees, at each locality, review and prioritize incoming requests for support. Each team considers it a privilege to provide support to their communities. 
The foundation’s support is limited to public charities, as recognized by the IRS under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the organization must meet the locality requirement to be eligible for consideration, supporting the foundation’s mission of giving back to the communities in which our employees live and work. All team recommendations are reviewed by the foundation board prior to approval.

In addition to the foundation grants, our employees have many opportunities to volunteer their personal time and services to help improve the quality of life of fellow citizens in their communities.  Some examples of employee involvement include partnering with Habitat for Humanity to build homes, holding food and collection drives to support local nonprofit organizations, serving meals at The Salvation Army, interacting with seniors at adult care facilities, assisting our nonprofit partners with projects that include painting, cleaning and yard work.
Our employees understand the value of being good neighbors.  The American Woodmark family believes that when we reach out a hand to help others, everyone benefits.


 
 
 




Environmental Stewardship

 



As we safeguard public health and safety, we are committed to protecting the environment.

As a leading U.S. manufacturer of fine cabinetry, American Woodmark Corporation is committed to conducting business in a manner that both protects the environment and safeguards public health and safety. To achieve this end, the company proactively identifies potential environmental risks and monitors compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and internal standards. 
The company has received certification by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association’s (KCMA) Environmental Stewardship Program on all products. The certification was awarded based on compliance across a broad range of activities including air quality, product resource management, process resource management, environmental stewardship and community relations. 
The company works with all suppliers to encourage sustainable forestry practices. Wood doors, drawer fronts and cabinet front frames are made from solid hardwoods. Particleboard and plywood are purchased from suppliers that meet the Composite Panel Association requirements for Environmentally Preferred Products or Eco-Certified Composite Standards.

The company uses leading edge technologies to limit both hazardous and non-hazardous emissions, byproducts and waste. Ongoing, formal programs identify opportunities for recycling and reusing materials. When waste ultimately requires disposal, steps are taken to minimize the environmental impact. 
The American Woodmark Foundation supports local programs serving the community, including activities focused on maintaining the quality of life. Our company is dedicated to doing our part to preserve and sustain the environment.

American Woodmark, Kitchen and Bath cabinet manufacturer, headquartered in Winchester, Virginia. The company operates 9 manufacturing facilities, in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and 9 builder service centers across the country.
History[edit]
Starting in 1951, Alvin A. Goldhush, a Long Island dentist, made dental cabinets and created the company Formed Laminates, Inc. in Lindenhurst, N.Y. Goldhush eventually gave up dentistry and devoted his time to the company, now named Raygold Corp. Raygold Corp acquired a wood processing plant in Moorefield, W.V. in 1957. Boise Cascade, at the time a conglomerate, acquired Raygold and moved the company head office from Long Island to Winchester, Virginia. Boise Cascade changed it business focus from wood products to paper products. In 1979 executives of the cabinetry division initiated a leveraged buyout. American Woodmark Corporation formed in 1980.

Product Care

Keep your cabinets looking like new!

Cabinet Interiors

For general cleaning, wipe cabinet interiors with a clean damp cloth or sponge; dry immediately.
To remove food particles or grease, dampen clean cloth with mild soap, wipe clean and dry immediately.
If a spill occurs, clean and dry the surface immediately as liquid can soak through the surface and cause greater damage.



Laminated, Painted, or Thermofoil Surfaces

Most non-abrasive household cleaners are appropriate for cleaning our laminate, painted or Thermo Foil cabinetry.
Avoid cleaners containing acetone, ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, harsh solvents and abrasives.
Never wax or polish these surfaces.



Spice Drawers

Butcher's wax is applied to the underside of the drawers to ensure smooth operation. If necessary, you may reapply the wax. Available at The Home Depot.



General Information

Excess water can cause blemishes and haziness to the finish and possibly damage the wood; clean and dry spills quickly.
Be aware; direct sunlight can cause cabinets to lighten or darken over time.
Smoke and grease are common elements in the kitchen and will adhere to your cabinets; clean them regularly to help protect their appearance.
Extremes in temperature and moisture can cause wood to expand and contract, causing damage to the finish. Try to avoid these extremes.



Decorative Hardware

For general cleaning, wipe with a clean damp cloth or sponge and mild soap, dry immediately.
Buff with clean cloth.
Do not use polishes that contain harsh or abrasive chemicals, as they may damage the hardware's surface.



Wood Surfaces

For general cleaning, wipe with a clean damp cloth or sponge; dry immediately.
Most wood finishes can be cleaned with any commercial cleaning polish.
Avoid products containing wax, petroleum or silicones, which can damage your cabinets.



Range Hoods

Clean the exposed metal surfaces once a month or as needed.
The aluminum filter is dishwasher safe and should be cleaned after every 25 hours of use or as needed to allow adequate air flow to the fan.



Chopping Blocks & Cutting Boards

Chopping blocks and cutting boards are seasoned with food-grade mineral oil prior to shipment.
Wash in warm soapy water prior to use first time.
To resist stains, condition the surface periodically with a small amount of food-grade mineral oil.
For general cleaning, wipe surface with clean damp cloth or sponge; dry immediately.
If surface was used to prepare raw meats, scrub thoroughly with a clean cloth or sponge soaked in hot water and mild soap; wipe clean and dry immediately.

The department has development teams working on the applications used in manufacturing and supply chain operations. These applications are used to track the flow of cabinetry parts, which are manufactured at one location, and the finished products, which may be assembled and distributed from other locations. The main office manages these IT projects, and makes decisions concerning the onsite support of these technology applications.

The company relies on Kronos for Manufacturing as a centralized means of tracking the time and attendance of manufacturing workers. They also have used Alisar Charting software as a project management tool.

American Woodmark, Kitchen and Bath cabinet manufacturer, headquartered in Winchester, Virginia. The company operates 9 manufacturing facilities, in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and 9 builder service centers across the country.
History[edit]
Starting in 1951, Alvin A. Goldhush, a Long Island dentist, made dental cabinets and created the company Formed Laminates, Inc. in Lindenhurst, N.Y. Goldhush eventually gave up dentistry and devoted his time to the company, now named Raygold Corp. Raygold Corp acquired a wood processing plant in Moorefield, W.V. in 1957. Boise Cascade, at the time a conglomerate, acquired Raygold and moved the company head office from Long Island to Winchester, Virginia. Boise Cascade changed it business focus from wood products to paper products. In 1979 executives of the cabinetry division initiated a leveraged buyout. American Woodmark Corporation formed in 1980.

American Woodmark, Kitchen and Bath cabinet manufacturer, headquartered in Winchester, Virginia. The company operates 9 manufacturing facilities, in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and 9 builder service centers across the country.
History[edit]
Starting in 1951, Alvin A. Goldhush, a Long Island dentist, made dental cabinets and created the company Formed Laminates, Inc. in Lindenhurst, N.Y. Goldhush eventually gave up dentistry and devoted his time to the company, now named Raygold Corp. Raygold Corp acquired a wood processing plant in Moorefield, W.V. in 1957. Boise Cascade, at the time a conglomerate, acquired Raygold and moved the company head office from Long Island to Winchester, Virginia. Boise Cascade changed it business focus from wood products to paper products. In 1979 executives of the cabinetry division initiated a leveraged buyout. American Woodmark Corporation formed in 1980.

I love the people I work with... and the principles the company was founded on. I highly recommend their products and services. If you're considering employment, look no further. Great pay and benefits as well as a job you will love. 展开Cassie Vannoy · 2017年6月1日Terrible company to work for. They allow harassment in the workplace and HR does not take employees seriously if it's regarding someone in management. I had to ...quit because the stress and tension coming from a manager became unhealthy. Long story short, if you work here and someone is bothering you, don't expect HR to help in any way. Additionally, the product isn't awful but I'd choose another brand before going with AW product. Expect lots of replacements and damaged products if you choose this brand. 展开John R. Bowen Jr. · 2017年2月4日Why does this company take almost two weeks to ship at least some of their special order products to the stores (Home Depot)?  I'm having Home Depot put in a ki...tchen island which is made up of two cabinets and a counter top.  One week after the cabinets were installed a guy from the counter top manufacturer came to template for it and told me that it would require an additional 4 support brackets.  I informed a sales rep at Home Depot and they ordered 4 support brackets (model #AS12).  They were ordered on January 27.  HD informed me today (2/4) that American Woodmark would not be shipping them out until February 6 and then it would take 2 to 6 business days for them to arrive at HD.  Because of the lack of communication from HD (they just let you hang) I've had to reschedule the counter top install (TWICE)!  Why on earth should it take almost two weeks to get four brackets onto a truck to go to a Home Depot in Pennsylvania and another two to four business days to move them from Maryland to Pennsylvania?!  I am thoroughly disgusted by the way this project is being handled by both Home Depot and American Woodmark and will no longer do any kind of business with either company! 展开Hyun Jo · 2017年1月18日Waypoint (an American Woodmark brand) cabinets via @cherryhillkitchenandbathllc. Upon delivery, I inspected my ~10k purchase only to be severely disappointed in... their overall build quality as well as defects.  I brought up my issues with them, and expressed my dissatisfaction. The said that they would send a Waypoint sales rep to assess the situation. The sales rep looked at the defects, and basically told me that this is within the specs of their product. She told me that she would try to replace the specific doors that I had issues with, but could not guarantee that I would get defect-free replacements.  So I told her that in that case, I would like to return for a full refund. To which she responded that it is not their 'policy' to accept returns. 展开James Foster · 2016年9月22日American Woodmark...  They want to say they are world class. But I was an employee with near perfect attendance and flawless work ethic. Any supervisor or team ...lead can tell you I would do anything asked of me and more. Other employees will tell you how much I loved my job. But trip and get hurt off the clock. And they will call and terminate you via phone call. Ridiculous..  There has to be an option of discipline without termination. When dealing with an employee that constantly went above and beyond. And absolutely loved their job. Thanks for ruining my career. That will never be World Class. 展开Sina Brehmer-Songer · 2016年10月11日Worst workmanship in cabinetry.  It took three months to finally return cabinets that were built so poorly, they literally fell apart during installation. Paint... was barley existing and poorly finished. Reps were sent out and claimed this was industry standard, not my industry though. I wish I could post photos as they tell a million words. It was an awful experience all around.  The dream kitchen was the absolute nightmare!!!! Glad to be moving on now. 展开Billie Kataytay · 2017年5月5日👎Vanessa Furman - Can't Understand Normal Thinking全部视频American Woodmark New Corporate Office Groundbreaking6617全部帖子American Woodmark Careers · 6月2日 · http://investors.americanwoodmark.com/file/Index…Press ReleaseWINCHESTER, Va., May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- American Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ: AMWD) today announced results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017.investors.americanwoodmark.comAmerican Woodmark Careers · 6月1日 · http://investors.americanwoodmark.com/file/Index…全部帖子American Woodmark Careers · 6月1日 · http://investors.americanwoodmark.com/file/Index…American Woodmark Careers · 5月5日 · Come celebrate with us!

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
