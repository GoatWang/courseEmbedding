Education[edit]
Lesar was born in Madison, Wisconsin and is a 1978 graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Business Administration degree.
Career[edit]
As a Certified Public Accountant, Lesar spent 16 years working at Arthur Andersen.
In 1995, Lesar joined Halliburton. Within a year of his arrival, Lesar was appointed as CEO of KBR, in addition to his duties as CFO of Halliburton. In 1997, Lesar was appointed as the company's President and Chief operating officer. In 2000, Lesar became CEO of Halliburton. He stepped down as the CEO in 2017 and is now the Chairman of Halliburton's Board of Directors.
He also serves on the board of directors at Lyondell Chemical, is a member of the Upstream Committee of the American Petroleum Institute and is on the board of directors of the American Iranian Council, an organization devoted to the normalization of American-Iranian relations.[3]
Controversies[edit]
The movie Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers claims that Lesar has been paid over $42,000,000 by Halliburton since the beginning of Iraq war, but this amount has risen significantly since the release of the film. According to The Wall Street Journal Lesar received about $14.9 million in 2010 alone, not including stock options or other deferred incentives - a 20% increase over his 2009 pay package, according to a securities filing.
In November 2014, Lesar faced criticism over his bid to take over Baker Hughes Inc : "the smaller oil-field services rival, in an email to Mr. Lesar, described Halliburton’s actions as intransigent and inappropriate".[4]

 David J. Lesar 1954— Biography



      David J. Lesar
      
      1954–
    











        Chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer,
        Halliburton Company
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1954.
    

      Education: University of Wisconsin, BS, 1975, MBA, 1978.
    

      Career: Arthur Andersen Company, 1978–1993, commercial group

      executive vice president of finance and administration; Halliburton
      Company, 1995–1996, executive vice president and chief financial

      officer; Halliburton Company, 1997–2000, president and chief

      chief executive officer.
    

      Address: Halliburton Company, 5 Houston Center, 1401 McKinney Street,
      Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77020; http://www.halliburton.com.
    

      ■ Lesar joined Houston-based Halliburton, the world's
      largest diversified energy services, engineering, and construction
      company, in 1993. In August 2000 he was named chairman of the board of
      directors, president, and chief executive officer. Lesar succeeded Richard
      B. Cheney, who left when he accepted the Republican presidential candidate
      George W. Bush's offer to become his vice presidential running
      mate. Cheney stated in a PR Newswire article, "Having worked
      closely with Dave Lesar and the Halliburton management team over the past
      five years, I have great confidence for the future success of
      Halliburton" (July 25, 2000).
    

      HALLIBURTON
    

      Halliburton operates in over one hundred countries, with more than 83,000
      employees working worldwide in diverse areas, such as deepwater drilling,
      remotely operated vehicle operations, and railroad construction. It also
      provides products, services, maintenance, and engineering to the energy,
      construction, and government sectors. It receives about 70 percent of its
      revenues outside the United States, with 70 to 75 percent of its business
      being related to energy.
    

      The company, with about $16.2 billion in total sales in 2003, conducts
      business through its two main groups: Halli-burton Energy Services Group
      and Halliburton Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR Engineering and Construction).
      In March 2002 Lesar separated these two groups into two wholly owned
      operating subsidiaries. The Energy Services Group (with about 55 percent
      of Halliburton's revenues and more than 80 percent of its operating
      income) provides a wide diversity of products and services to gas and oil
      customers worldwide, such as pressure pumping services, drill-bit and
      other down-hole and completion tool manufacturing, undersea engineering,
      oil and gas equipment, production enhancement, and logging and testing.
      Halliburton KBR works on both energy-related and civil infrastructure
      facilities, such refining and processing plants, liquefied natural gas
      plants, pipelines, and production facilities, both offshore and onshore.
      Its nonenergy business provides the engineering and construction needs of
      government and civil infrastructure customers. KBR supplies operations and
      maintenance for a wide variety of facilities, such as prisons, highways,
      and stadiums, and offers planning and management support for the U.S.
      military.
    

      ADVANCING WITHIN HALLIBURTON
    

      After 16 years of employment at Arthur Andersen in Dallas, Texas, last
      serving as a commercial group director and partner in charge of the oil
      and gas, manufacturing, telecommunications, and retail sectors, Lesar
      joined Halliburton. For two years (from 1993 to 1995) he was executive
      vice president of finance and administration of Halliburton Energy, and
      the next year he served as executive vice president and chief financial
      officer of Halliburton Energy Services, a Halliburton business unit. From
      June 1996 through June 1997 he was president and chief executive officer
      of Brown & Root, the Halliburton business unit that provides
      engineering and construction services in the petroleum, forest products,
      civil, environmental, manufacturing, maintenance, and government markets.
      From June 1997 to August 2000 Lesar was president and chief operating
      officer of Halliburton. In August 2000
       Lesar assumed the position of chairman, president, and CEO of
      Halliburton.
    

      IMPACT ON COMPANY STRATEGY
    

      Halliburton's strategy essentially did not change when Lesar took
      over from Cheney. For several years Lesar had already been actively
      running the company, with Cheney responsible for interacting with
      customers. In fact, during the years before becoming chief executive
      officer, Lesar was critical in the company's transition from
      market-share mining (which involved concentrating solely in mining) to a
      more diversified position involving the entire spectrum of oil and gas
      products and services. Lesar helped Halliburton executives recognize that
      the industry was preparing to outsource more technologies to service
      companies—services that Lesar wanted Halli-burton to be able to
      provide throughout the industry.
    

      As a result of the outsourcing trend, Lesar led Halliburton in a series of
      acquisitions, which allowed the company to obtain the skills and tools it
      needed to offer services in such areas as directional logging, liquefied
      gas products, drilling, and reservoir integration. He found that
      Halliburton was able to provide these services to a wide range of
      companies, from large integrated oil companies to small independent
      companies. In addition, Lesar played an important part in developing
      Halliburton's investment in research and development, which reduced
      costs, increased safety, and decreased environmental impacts. From 1997 to
      2001 Lesar oversaw Halliburton's billion-dollar investment in
      developing technologies. These technologies created products that solved
      problems, enhanced assets, and delivered long-term value for customers and
      shareholders. By 2001, 20 percent of Halliburton's total revenues
      were in new technology accounts.
    

      REVERSING LOSING PROJECTS
    

      In the first few years of the 2000s Halliburton lost money on several
      large international engineering, procurement, installation, and
      construction (EPIC) projects. The EPIC projects were formerly run as
      lump-sum payments—single payments made at the beginning of a
      contract, and in which Halliburton paid all unexpected costs during the
      contract period; however, since actual costs were often higher than
      estimates, losses occurred. Lesar saw, for instance, that in 2002
      Halliburton lost $119 million on a joint venture to develop 55 deepwater
      oil wells off Brazil's coast, and another $33 million on an
      offshore Philippine oil platform project. As a result, KBR's
      operating profit margins were only 2.1 percent in 2002, below its
      predicted 3.0 percent. Lesar declared that Halliburton would no longer bid
      for lump-sum payments on international EPIC projects.
    

      LOGCAP
    

      By 2004 the U.S. military relied greatly on private military companies
      (PMCs) to support its operations in many countries, such as Iraq. In fact,
      civilian contractors handled as much as 20 to 30 percent of critical
      military support services in Iraq. Lesar made sure that KBR was the
      best-equipped service company to assume those jobs. In the early 2000s the
      company housed, fed, and maintained (with such functions as mail delivery,
      laundry facilities and operations, and heavy equipment use) American
      fighting troops in some of the world's most remote and dangerous
      locations. Based partly on KBR's past performance in supporting
      U.S. forces, Lesar secured, in December 2001, a 10-year project from the
      U.S. Pentagon known as the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program
      (LOGCAP)—a U.S. Army plan that hires civilian contractors to
      support U.S. forces in Department of Defense missions. The cost-plus
      contract, a pricing system that calculates the price of a product by
      adding a specified percentage as profit to the contract—thus
      guaranteeing the company a small profit—was open-ended and thus
      gave KBR the budgetary freedom to send its employees anywhere in the world
      to run military operations.
    

      Lesar secured KBR's first LOGCAP contract in June 2002, during the
      "war on terrorism." It was awarded a $22 million contract to
      operate support services at Camp Stronghold Freedom, which is located at
      the Khanabad Air Base in central Uzbekistan. KBR supplied products and
      services to Khanabad—one of the primary U.S. bases in the
      Afghanistan war that housed approximately one thousand U.S. soldiers.
      Later, in November 2002, Lesar secured a one-year contract, estimated at
      $42.5 million, to make available laundry services, showers, mess halls,
      and heating equipment services for troops at bases in Bagram and
      Khandahar, in Afghanistan. KBR also received contracts to help run
      Incirlik Air Base and other U.S. military facilities in Turkey.
    

      E-VENTURES
    

      Lesar pursued Internet-type electronic ventures (eventures) in order to
      integrate other leading companies into one group. One of Lesar's
      initiatives was his 2000 agreement to partially acquire Petroleum Place, a
      leading Internet company that focuses on improving how procedures are
      conducted with respect to buying and selling within the global oil and gas
      market. In partnership with Halliburton's wholly owned subsidiary
      Landmark Graphics Corporation, Petroleum Place offers online access to
      Landmark software for use with buying and selling of company products and
      services. In addition, in 2004 the alliance was planning to develop
      software for evauating prospective oil and gas fields and other such
      properties.
    

      Lesar stated that such a project would enable Halliburton to better assist
      oil companies with the management of their oil and gas reservoirs. Though
      acquisitions and divestitures are
       generally inefficient in discovering new properties and evaluating
      existing properties, Lesar believed that the Petroleum Place alliance,
      with its use of Internet-based data analysis, would reduce the time needed
      for analysis reviews and lower costs of materials and labor.
    

      CRITICISM
    

      Halliburton and its subsidiaries were widely condemned in the early 2000s
      for their contracts in various countries where environmental problems and
      human rights violations are widespread (including Algeria, Bolivia,
      Bosnia, Brazil, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Indonesia). The
      company's associations with past and present U.S. administrations,
      including its relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as
      Halliburton's chief executive officer between 1995 and 2000, were
      also problematic.
    

      Lesar and Halliburton were criticized about accounting procedures as well.
      In the late 1990s Halliburton transferred from cost-plus contracts to more
      fixed-price contracts. The new contracts required the company to finish
      jobs for a fixed fee and then to attempt to negotiate payments of cost
      overruns and changes in orders. Although resolving such disputes can take
      months or even years, Halliburton financial officials decided it was
      "reasonable" to identify, for tax purposes, at least part of
      the revenue from the claims during the time they were in dispute. The U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission investigated whether this accounting
      practice was intended to defraud.
    

      Lesar also contended with asbestos litigation, which was initiated when
      the company acquired Dressor Industries in 1998 for $7.7 billion. A
      Dressor subsidiary had once used a carcinogen in its pipe coatings and
      bricks. Lesar initiated a bold plan to settle asbestos-related lawsuits by
      instituting a "contained" bankruptcy of KBR, a plan that
      would keep most of Halliburton out of bankruptcy.
    

      FUTURE PROSPECTS
    

      Lesar hoped that Halliburton would continue to be a leading—if not
      the leading—player in the multibillion-dollar rebuilding of postwar
      Iraq, particularly the rebuilding of the country's oil wells. But
      along with the increase of government contracts awarded to Halliburton
      came accusations that the company was receiving favoritism from
      politically prominent employees and former employees.
    

      Lesar rejected such talk by pointing to the company's long history
      as a government contractor. He continued to insist that he was very proud
      of the Halliburton organization and especially of its support of the U.S.
      military and the savings it had provided to the military's overseas
      activities. In any case, the bottom line for Halliburton was that its
      future, especially with Lesar at the helm, looked promising and
      profitable.

Nationality: American.
Born: 1954.
Education: University of Wisconsin, BS, 1975, MBA, 1978.
Career: Arthur Andersen Company, 1978–1993, commercial group director and partner; Halliburton Energy Services, 1993–1995, executive vice president of finance and administration; Halliburton Company, 1995–1996, executive vice president and chief financial officer; Brown and Root, 1996–1997, president and chief executive officer; Halliburton Company, 1997–2000, president and chief operating officer; 2000–, chairman of the board, president, and chief executive officer.
Address: Halliburton Company, 5 Houston Center, 1401 McKinney Street, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77020; http://www.halliburton.com.
■ Lesar joined Houston-based Halliburton, the world's largest diversified energy services, engineering, and construction company, in 1993. In August 2000 he was named chairman of the board of directors, president, and chief executive officer. Lesar succeeded Richard B. Cheney, who left when he accepted the Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's offer to become his vice presidential running mate. Cheney stated in a PR Newswire article, "Having worked closely with Dave Lesar and the Halliburton management team over the past five years, I have great confidence for the future success of Halliburton" (July 25, 2000).
HALLIBURTON
Halliburton operates in over one hundred countries, with more than 83,000 employees working worldwide in diverse areas, such as deepwater drilling, remotely operated vehicle operations, and railroad construction. It also provides products, services, maintenance, and engineering to the energy, construction, and government sectors. It receives about 70 percent of its revenues outside the United States, with 70 to 75 percent of its business being related to energy.
The company, with about $16.2 billion in total sales in 2003, conducts business through its two main groups: Halli-burton Energy Services Group and Halliburton Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR Engineering and Construction). In March 2002 Lesar separated these two groups into two wholly owned operating subsidiaries. The Energy Services Group (with about 55 percent of Halliburton's revenues and more than 80 percent of its operating income) provides a wide diversity of products and services to gas and oil customers worldwide, such as pressure pumping services, drill-bit and other down-hole and completion tool manufacturing, undersea engineering, oil and gas equipment, production enhancement, and logging and testing. Halliburton KBR works on both energy-related and civil infrastructure facilities, such refining and processing plants, liquefied natural gas plants, pipelines, and production facilities, both offshore and onshore. Its nonenergy business provides the engineering and construction needs of government and civil infrastructure customers. KBR supplies operations and maintenance for a wide variety of facilities, such as prisons, highways, and stadiums, and offers planning and management support for the U.S. military.
ADVANCING WITHIN HALLIBURTON


After 16 years of employment at Arthur Andersen in Dallas, Texas, last serving as a commercial group director and partner in charge of the oil and gas, manufacturing, telecommunications, and retail sectors, Lesar joined Halliburton. For two years (from 1993 to 1995) he was executive vice president of finance and administration of Halliburton Energy, and the next year he served as executive vice president and chief financial officer of Halliburton Energy Services, a Halliburton business unit. From June 1996 through June 1997 he was president and chief executive officer of Brown & Root, the Halliburton business unit that provides engineering and construction services in the petroleum, forest products, civil, environmental, manufacturing, maintenance, and government markets. From June 1997 to August 2000 Lesar was president and chief operating officer of Halliburton. In August 2000 Lesar assumed the position of chairman, president, and CEO of Halliburton.
IMPACT ON COMPANY STRATEGY
Halliburton's strategy essentially did not change when Lesar took over from Cheney. For several years Lesar had already been actively running the company, with Cheney responsible for interacting with customers. In fact, during the years before becoming chief executive officer, Lesar was critical in the company's transition from market-share mining (which involved concentrating solely in mining) to a more diversified position involving the entire spectrum of oil and gas products and services. Lesar helped Halliburton executives recognize that the industry was preparing to outsource more technologies to service companies—services that Lesar wanted Halli-burton to be able to provide throughout the industry.
As a result of the outsourcing trend, Lesar led Halliburton in a series of acquisitions, which allowed the company to obtain the skills and tools it needed to offer services in such areas as directional logging, liquefied gas products, drilling, and reservoir integration. He found that Halliburton was able to provide these services to a wide range of companies, from large integrated oil companies to small independent companies. In addition, Lesar played an important part in developing Halliburton's investment in research and development, which reduced costs, increased safety, and decreased environmental impacts. From 1997 to 2001 Lesar oversaw Halliburton's billion-dollar investment in developing technologies. These technologies created products that solved problems, enhanced assets, and delivered long-term value for customers and shareholders. By 2001, 20 percent of Halliburton's total revenues were in new technology accounts.
REVERSING LOSING PROJECTS
In the first few years of the 2000s Halliburton lost money on several large international engineering, procurement, installation, and construction (EPIC) projects. The EPIC projects were formerly run as lump-sum payments—single payments made at the beginning of a contract, and in which Halliburton paid all unexpected costs during the contract period; however, since actual costs were often higher than estimates, losses occurred. Lesar saw, for instance, that in 2002 Halliburton lost $119 million on a joint venture to develop 55 deepwater oil wells off Brazil's coast, and another $33 million on an offshore Philippine oil platform project. As a result, KBR's operating profit margins were only 2.1 percent in 2002, below its predicted 3.0 percent. Lesar declared that Halliburton would no longer bid for lump-sum payments on international EPIC projects.
LOGCAP
By 2004 the U.S. military relied greatly on private military companies (PMCs) to support its operations in many countries, such as Iraq. In fact, civilian contractors handled as much as 20 to 30 percent of critical military support services in Iraq. Lesar made sure that KBR was the best-equipped service company to assume those jobs. In the early 2000s the company housed, fed, and maintained (with such functions as mail delivery, laundry facilities and operations, and heavy equipment use) American fighting troops in some of the world's most remote and dangerous locations. Based partly on KBR's past performance in supporting U.S. forces, Lesar secured, in December 2001, a 10-year project from the U.S. Pentagon known as the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP)—a U.S. Army plan that hires civilian contractors to support U.S. forces in Department of Defense missions. The cost-plus contract, a pricing system that calculates the price of a product by adding a specified percentage as profit to the contract—thus guaranteeing the company a small profit—was open-ended and thus gave KBR the budgetary freedom to send its employees anywhere in the world to run military operations.
Lesar secured KBR's first LOGCAP contract in June 2002, during the "war on terrorism." It was awarded a $22 million contract to operate support services at Camp Stronghold Freedom, which is located at the Khanabad Air Base in central Uzbekistan. KBR supplied products and services to Khanabad—one of the primary U.S. bases in the Afghanistan war that housed approximately one thousand U.S. soldiers. Later, in November 2002, Lesar secured a one-year contract, estimated at $42.5 million, to make available laundry services, showers, mess halls, and heating equipment services for troops at bases in Bagram and Khandahar, in Afghanistan. KBR also received contracts to help run Incirlik Air Base and other U.S. military facilities in Turkey.
E-VENTURES
Lesar pursued Internet-type electronic ventures (eventures) in order to integrate other leading companies into one group. One of Lesar's initiatives was his 2000 agreement to partially acquire Petroleum Place, a leading Internet company that focuses on improving how procedures are conducted with respect to buying and selling within the global oil and gas market. In partnership with Halliburton's wholly owned subsidiary Landmark Graphics Corporation, Petroleum Place offers online access to Landmark software for use with buying and selling of company products and services. In addition, in 2004 the alliance was planning to develop software for evauating prospective oil and gas fields and other such properties.
Lesar stated that such a project would enable Halliburton to better assist oil companies with the management of their oil and gas reservoirs. Though acquisitions and divestitures are generally inefficient in discovering new properties and evaluating existing properties, Lesar believed that the Petroleum Place alliance, with its use of Internet-based data analysis, would reduce the time needed for analysis reviews and lower costs of materials and labor.
CRITICISM
Halliburton and its subsidiaries were widely condemned in the early 2000s for their contracts in various countries where environmental problems and human rights violations are widespread (including Algeria, Bolivia, Bosnia, Brazil, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Indonesia). The company's associations with past and present U.S. administrations, including its relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, who served as Halliburton's chief executive officer between 1995 and 2000, were also problematic.


Lesar and Halliburton were criticized about accounting procedures as well. In the late 1990s Halliburton transferred from cost-plus contracts to more fixed-price contracts. The new contracts required the company to finish jobs for a fixed fee and then to attempt to negotiate payments of cost overruns and changes in orders. Although resolving such disputes can take months or even years, Halliburton financial officials decided it was "reasonable" to identify, for tax purposes, at least part of the revenue from the claims during the time they were in dispute. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated whether this accounting practice was intended to defraud.
Lesar also contended with asbestos litigation, which was initiated when the company acquired Dressor Industries in 1998 for $7.7 billion. A Dressor subsidiary had once used a carcinogen in its pipe coatings and bricks. Lesar initiated a bold plan to settle asbestos-related lawsuits by instituting a "contained" bankruptcy of KBR, a plan that would keep most of Halliburton out of bankruptcy.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Lesar hoped that Halliburton would continue to be a leading—if not the leading—player in the multibillion-dollar rebuilding of postwar Iraq, particularly the rebuilding of the country's oil wells. But along with the increase of government contracts awarded to Halliburton came accusations that the company was receiving favoritism from politically prominent employees and former employees.
Lesar rejected such talk by pointing to the company's long history as a government contractor. He continued to insist that he was very proud of the Halliburton organization and especially of its support of the U.S. military and the savings it had provided to the military's overseas activities. In any case, the bottom line for Halliburton was that its future, especially with Lesar at the helm, looked promising and profitable.

Halliburton Moving C.E.O. From Houston to Dubai

Correction Appended



HOUSTON, March 11 — Halliburton, the big energy services company, said on Sunday that it would open a corporate headquarters in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai and move its chairman and chief executive, David J. Lesar, there.The company will maintain its existing corporate office here as well as its legal incorporation in the United States, meaning that it will still be subject to domestic laws and regulations.Although the announcement of the new Dubai arrangement took many by surprise, Halliburton said that the move was part of a strategy announced in mid-2006 to concentrate its efforts in the Middle East and surrounding areas, where state-owned oil companies represent a growing source of business.Halliburton, which was led by Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995 to 2000, is currently in the process of spinning off KBR, its military contracting unit, to focus on its business of drilling wells and maintaining fields for oil companies. The company did not say what implications the Dubai development might have for its military contracts. Lea Anne McBride, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, referred questions about the company’s plans to Halliburton.

The Dubai announcement, which Halliburton made at a regional energy conference in Bahrain, comes at a time when the company is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations of improper dealings in Iraq, Kuwait and Nigeria. Halliburton has also agreed to pay billions of dollars in settlements in asbestos litigation. Continue reading the main story

Halliburton would not elaborate on Sunday on what the shift of its top executive might mean for some of the issues it faces. The move seemed to raise questions about whether Halliburton might gain tax advantages or other benefits.A Halliburton spokeswoman, Melissa Norcross, referred inquiries to the company’s press release, saying in an e-mail message, “The C.E.O.’s job is global by nature. He will continue to remain attentive to our shareholders, clients and employees around the world.”Ms. Norcross added, “As companies usually refer to the C.E.O.’s office as the corporate headquarters, that’s what we are doing. Basing the C.E.O. in Dubai to focus on our Eastern Hemisphere growth makes good business sense, as it is the center of our Eastern Hemisphere operations and a global business hub. We will maintain our company’s legal registration in the United States and we are not leaving Houston.”The mayor of Houston, Bill White, was notified by telephone shortly before Halliburton made the announcement, according to a spokesman, Frank Michel.“We don’t expect it will have a big impact on employment here,” Mr. Michel said. “We point out that Houston continues to be the center for the international oil and gas business.”

“Having a corporate headquarters is different than it used to be,” Mr. Michel added. “Executives spend a lot more time on airplanes, and we understand that.” He noted that Schlumberger, one of Halliburton’s top competitors, maintains offices in both Paris and Houston.On the face of it, the decision to move Mr. Lesar abroad appears to point mainly to how the epicenters of the energy business are moving from the mature fields of North America to the younger fields of the Middle East and Africa. It also underscores the arrival of Dubai as a center for energy deal-making and commerce, a role once solidly filled by Houston.

“My office will be in Dubai, and I will run our entire worldwide operations from that office,” said Mr. Lesar, who holds the titles of chairman, chief executive and president, at a conference in Manama, Bahrain’s capital. “The Eastern Hemisphere is a market that is more heavily weighted toward oil exploration and production opportunities. Growing our business here will bring more balance to Halliburton’s overall portfolio.”

Halliburton is incorporated in Delaware and its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Reuters reported that Mr. Lesar said Halliburton would like to list its shares on an exchange in the Middle East, which it could do while maintaining its listing in New York.Halliburton reported a record $2.3 billion in profit last year and continues to be the dominant oil-field service company in North America, where it generates 60 percent of its operating income.Over the last several years, an increasing amount of Halliburton’s business has shifted to places like Kuwait, Russia, Libya, Australia, Vietnam, and west and central Africa. And, mirroring trends in the energy business, its customer base is shifting from traditional Western oil companies to national oil companies in developing countries.Some analysts who follow Halliburton said they did not think the relocation of Mr. Lesar reflected anything more than changes in the energy business.“They are moving to the center of the Eurasian-African hemisphere and that’s where the bulk of the work is going to be in the future,” said Barbara Struck, an analyst with Energy Intelligence Group, a research firm.She said she doubted the company was trying to evade laws in the United States. Halliburton has suffered several years of negative headlines, many having to do with its administration of a $16 billion deal to support American military operations in Iraq. Halliburton’s KBR subsidiary has been the subject of a number of investigations for mishandling billions of dollars of housing, food and fuel contracts for American troops and government officials operating in Iraq. Halliburton began spinning off KBR last year.During Mr. Cheney’s tenure as chief executive, Halliburton bought a company that saddled it with asbestos claims. The company has agreed to pay nearly $5 billion in settlements.Despite its recent problems, Halliburton posted record revenue, net income and margins last year.Perhaps the biggest winner could be Dubai itself, one of seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates confederation, which has sought to establish itself as a regional commercial center on par with Singapore and Hong Kong. Most multinational companies, including Halliburton, have made Dubai a regional hub for their Middle Eastern business over the last decade.

 Correction: March 13, 2007  
An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by the oil services company Halliburton to transfer its chief executive to a corporate headquarters in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai misstated the surname of an analyst with Energy Intelligence Group, who commented on the move. She is Barbara Shook, not Barbara Struck.

David John Lesar is an American businessman who is the Chairman of Halliburton Energy Services. He was the CEO of Halliburton for 17 years from 2000 to 2017. Trained as a Certified Public Accountant, Lesar spent 16 years at Arthur Andersen. He had spent most of his career at Andersen, where he worked on their Halliburton account.

Education[edit]
Lesar was born in Madison, Wisconsin and is a 1978 graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Business Administration degree.
Career[edit]
As a Certified Public Accountant, Lesar spent 16 years working at Arthur Andersen.
In 1995, Lesar joined Halliburton. Within a year of his arrival, Lesar was appointed as CEO of KBR, in addition to his duties as CFO of Halliburton. In 1997, Lesar was appointed as the company's President and Chief operating officer. In 2000, Lesar became CEO of Halliburton. He stepped down as the CEO in 2017 and is now the Chairman of Halliburton's Board of Directors.
He also serves on the board of directors at Lyondell Chemical, is a member of the Upstream Committee of the American Petroleum Institute and is on the board of directors of the American Iranian Council, an organization devoted to the normalization of American-Iranian relations.[3]
Controversies[edit]
The movie Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers claims that Lesar has been paid over $42,000,000 by Halliburton since the beginning of Iraq war, but this amount has risen significantly since the release of the film. According to The Wall Street Journal Lesar received about $14.9 million in 2010 alone, not including stock options or other deferred incentives - a 20% increase over his 2009 pay package, according to a securities filing.
In November 2014, Lesar faced criticism over his bid to take over Baker Hughes Inc : "the smaller oil-field services rival, in an email to Mr. Lesar, described Halliburton’s actions as intransigent and inappropriate".[4]

Education[edit]
Lesar was born in Madison, Wisconsin and is a 1978 graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Business Administration degree.
Career[edit]
As a Certified Public Accountant, Lesar spent 16 years working at Arthur Andersen.
In 1995, Lesar joined Halliburton. Within a year of his arrival, Lesar was appointed as CEO of KBR, in addition to his duties as CFO of Halliburton. In 1997, Lesar was appointed as the company's President and Chief operating officer. In 2000, Lesar became CEO of Halliburton. He stepped down as the CEO in 2017 and is now the Chairman of Halliburton's Board of Directors.
He also serves on the board of directors at Lyondell Chemical, is a member of the Upstream Committee of the American Petroleum Institute and is on the board of directors of the American Iranian Council, an organization devoted to the normalization of American-Iranian relations.[3]
Controversies[edit]
The movie Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers claims that Lesar has been paid over $42,000,000 by Halliburton since the beginning of Iraq war, but this amount has risen significantly since the release of the film. According to The Wall Street Journal Lesar received about $14.9 million in 2010 alone, not including stock options or other deferred incentives - a 20% increase over his 2009 pay package, according to a securities filing.
In November 2014, Lesar faced criticism over his bid to take over Baker Hughes Inc : "the smaller oil-field services rival, in an email to Mr. Lesar, described Halliburton’s actions as intransigent and inappropriate".[4]

Halliburton Reaches Profitability in Iraq 

By Editor on January 25, 2011 in Iraq Oil & Gas News 

Announcing a 60% increase in net income for 2010, Halliburton‘s chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Dave Lesar (pictured), commented on the company’s Iraqi operations:
“I am very pleased with our results on the international front. Key markets including Norway, West Africa, Iraq, and Algeria experienced increased activity … We continue to win significant additional awards in Iraq. 
We, therefore, are investing heavily in our infrastructure and incurring mobilization costs. I am pleased to announce that we were modestly profitable in the fourth quarter in Iraq, several quarters ahead of schedule. 
We now have nearly 600 employees in Iraq with a plan to have 1,200 employees in 2011 to handle the work we have been awarded.”

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
