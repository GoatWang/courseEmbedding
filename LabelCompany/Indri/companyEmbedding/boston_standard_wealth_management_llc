Boston Standard Wealth ManagementWe Work for YouToggle navigation


Plan to Succeed
Honoring our region’s reputation as a global standard in academic excellence, technological innovation, and financial acumen, we deliver intellectually honest financial advice that employs the finest technology in asset management today, while honoring the time-tested principles that have helped investors sustainably build wealth for generations. Whether you’re planning for retirement, funding a child’s education, or simply ensuring you’ll be protected if something goes wrong, we can help you organize your finances to meet your life goals.






The Boston StandardYou’re smart. You’re busy. And you know your financial life could be more thoughtfully organized. You’ve considered expert help, but you’re concerned about fees and conflicts of interest. Our firm was built to help you optimize your finances in an environment of trust and confidentiality. We offer the industry’s highest standard of care and a fee structure that puts your interests first.  



Client ExperienceOur boutique approach means you have a partner in the process of managing your finances. Not an 800 number, but a Certified Financial Planner™ to answer your questions and help you navigate life’s financial challenges.
Due DiligenceNo two people are the same. Your finances, goals, and relationship with money are all unique. We understand the importance of listening carefully as you describe your needs and objectives. And then taking the time to thoughtfully address each one.
Intellectual HonestyWe can’t predict the future, time the market, or pick the next hot stock. History has shown that attempting to do so is a losing game. Instead we believe in offering candid analysis of what your investments can do for you and what you must plan to do for yourself.
TransparencyThe less you pay for financial management, the faster your wealth can grow – a simple truth that inspired our business model, fee structure, and portfolio solutions. We’re proud to highlight the cost of our work and help you compare the alternatives.
IndependenceAs an independent wealth management firm we deliver unbiased counsel because we’re not owned by a large brokerage house, insurance company, or public shareholders. We are fiduciaries paid by our clients to work for our clients.
InnovationWhile the core principles of sound investing are timeless, the products and technology available to execute those principles are constantly evolving. We are committed to implementing the best of these innovations to benefit your bottom line.



 





This is PersonalAs a boutique firm delivering a highly customized service, we get to know our clients well. We value open and honest communication. And we're passionate about helping each client reach their goals. We'd love to hear your story and how we can put over 65 years of financial services experience to work for you.

Lee started financial planning with American Express in 2003. The early years required 60-70 hour work weeks, but Lee was energized by the difference sound planning made in the lives of his clients. Lee's early networking focused on the MIT/Kendall Square area of Cambridge. Even now, most of his clients are analytic professionals working in academia, technology, and the life sciences. As a result, Lee specializes in helping clients effectively plan around their incentive stock plans, pensions, and deferred compensation. In 2011, Lee founded Boston Standard with partners who share the values articulated throughout this site. Lee genuinely delights in his work as a planner and the meaningful relationships it's helped foster. Lee lives in Charlestown with his wife, Rebecca, and two sons. While he still dreams of kayaking adventures, Lee spends most of his free time these days chasing his kids around and rooting for the Celtics.Dena G. CatinoDena G.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Boston Standard Wealth ManagementWe Work for YouToggle navigation


Plan to Succeed
Honoring our region’s reputation as a global standard in academic excellence, technological innovation, and financial acumen, we deliver intellectually honest financial advice that employs the finest technology in asset management today, while honoring the time-tested principles that have helped investors sustainably build wealth for generations. Whether you’re planning for retirement, funding a child’s education, or simply ensuring you’ll be protected if something goes wrong, we can help you organize your finances to meet your life goals.






The Boston StandardYou’re smart. You’re busy. And you know your financial life could be more thoughtfully organized. You’ve considered expert help, but you’re concerned about fees and conflicts of interest. Our firm was built to help you optimize your finances in an environment of trust and confidentiality. We offer the industry’s highest standard of care and a fee structure that puts your interests first.  



Client ExperienceOur boutique approach means you have a partner in the process of managing your finances. Not an 800 number, but a Certified Financial Planner™ to answer your questions and help you navigate life’s financial challenges.
Due DiligenceNo two people are the same. Your finances, goals, and relationship with money are all unique. We understand the importance of listening carefully as you describe your needs and objectives. And then taking the time to thoughtfully address each one.
Intellectual HonestyWe can’t predict the future, time the market, or pick the next hot stock. History has shown that attempting to do so is a losing game. Instead we believe in offering candid analysis of what your investments can do for you and what you must plan to do for yourself.
TransparencyThe less you pay for financial management, the faster your wealth can grow – a simple truth that inspired our business model, fee structure, and portfolio solutions. We’re proud to highlight the cost of our work and help you compare the alternatives.
IndependenceAs an independent wealth management firm we deliver unbiased counsel because we’re not owned by a large brokerage house, insurance company, or public shareholders. We are fiduciaries paid by our clients to work for our clients.
InnovationWhile the core principles of sound investing are timeless, the products and technology available to execute those principles are constantly evolving. We are committed to implementing the best of these innovations to benefit your bottom line.



 





This is PersonalAs a boutique firm delivering a highly customized service, we get to know our clients well. We value open and honest communication.
