Why Grisanti Capital Management?

 
Intense Research, Concentrated Portfolio
Our approach is to invest in only a few companies (usually less than 20) after extensive research.  We discard over 90% of the companies we investigate and then we hold our few, concentrated investments for an average of three years.

 Strong Performance 
By only owning a small number of companies, and not the whole market, we can invest where we think the value will be created over our three year investment horizon.  That has led to outperformance over the market since-inception (in 1999).

 Experience and Ownership 
Our five investment professionals have an average of over 20 years on Wall Street.  Chris Grisanti founded the firm in 1999 and used his own equity to buy out his two partners in 2011.

 Client Focused 
We manage separate accounts for each client, because the needs of one wealthy family, endowment or institution may be different from those of another.  We are accessible, responsive and, most importantly, able to tailor an account to your individual needs and goals.

Our Philosophy 
Some managers emphasize good returns; others a relationship you can count on.  We believe that trust and performance should both be part of the investment management relationship.  You ought to know how you are doing from quarter to quarter, and we will be transparent about your investments (just read our quarterly letters for an example).  Open communication creates trust, and trust itself can lead to better performance over the long term, because its presence means we can take long term contrarian investments that, by their very nature, are out of favor and disliked when we buy them.  Your trust helps avoid emotional reactions that lead to poor returns.  Our goal is to succeed by making you money over the long term in as safe a way as possible.  We want to earn your trust by managing your money intelligently, explaining what we are doing, and being responsive to your needs.

Our History
Grisanti Capital Management LLC (“GCM”) is an independently owned investment advisor registered with the SEC.  GCM was co-founded in 1999 by Chris Grisanti to serve High Net Worth Individuals, Endowments and Foundations. In late 2011, using his own capital, Chris Grisanti bought out the interests of the two other partners and now owns 100% of the firm.
Our five member investment team has over 100 years combined investment experience. GCM has two products, both of which are GIPS-compliant; The Large Cap Value Portfolio and the High Income Equity Portfolio.  We are long-term investors with a 3 to 4 year time horizon and have a strong, proven track record in varied market environments.
Large Cap Value Portfolio
Grisanti Capital Management’s belief is that the market is generally efficient and there are limited opportunities that combine superior upside potential with acceptable risk. This leads us to perform in-depth analysis and reject more than 90% of researched ideas. We look for this infrequent combination in two ways: either identifying securities selling at a discount to their current asset value or at a discount to their future cash flows.
Our process is bottom-up, and each company must have its own compelling investment thesis. Often we identify investable trends in the economy, which combine compelling macro dynamics with equity valuations that are attractive on either cash flow or asset value metrics. These themes, such as the American Oil Renaissance, the American Manufacturing Renaissance, Cable/Satellite/Telcomm Providers and the Rebirth of American Airlines, usually last for a multi-year period.
GCM has managed a concentrated portfolio of 15 to 25 stocks since the firm was founded in 1999. The stocks in the portfolio are predominantly large cap holdings ( >90%). No one position is to exceed 8% at the time of purchase. Stocks are held for an average of 3 to 4 years. Our portfolio is not index driven and does not mimic benchmarks, which is the primary reason for GCM’s long-term record of outperformance.
High Income Equity Portfolio
The Grisanti Capital Management High Income Equity Portfolio has three guiding principles: 1) to protect capital in turbulent markets, 2) to provide potential for capital appreciation with a degree of stability, and 3) to generate better than average current income.  This conservative approach is designed to deliver a steady return in various market environments.  The product is not designed to “keep up with the market.” Rather, this product is designed for investors seeking some equity exposure with less risk and higher income. It will tend to outperform the overall market (as measured by the S&P 500 Index) in periods of declining or volatile prices, and it will tend to lag behind (but still appreciate) in sharply rising markets. It offers equity exposure with less volatility and a high dividend yield.

What Makes Grisanti Capital Management Different?
Since our founding in 1999, Grisanti Capital Management has delivered strong, value-oriented investment performance for individuals, families, and institutions such as foundations, endowments, and pension funds.
Value Focus
For the past 15 years, we have focused intently on investing in companies that are neglected or even despised by the market. These out-of-favor companies can produce excellent returns  as they regain the market’s good graces. Financial companies in 2009, oil refiners in 2012, and technology firms after the tech bubble burst in 2000-2002 are prime examples of successful value investments we have made over our history.
Research & Concentration
Our intensive research leads us to develop concentrated portfolios that include 15-25 stocks. We typically reject more than 90% of the securities we initially examine. Over the years we’ve found this concentration produces strong results that differ from a more index-like portfolio. We report in detail to our clients each quarter and share our research and investment goals.
Client Focus
From our inception, Grisanti Capital Management realizes that a small firm like ours must differentiate itself by providing sophisticated, custom service to our clients. Many of our clients have come to us after being treated to an impersonal “asset allocation” test at large Wall Street firms. You’ll find that we tailor our services to meet your needs and investment strategy. You won’t deal with a sales person – you will work directly with a professional that is working with you to create a long-term investment plan.
Independent Ownership
Chris Grisanti co-founded the firm. At the end of 2011, he bought out his two partners using his own capital. Currently, he is the sole owner of the firm and is committed to its growth.  He is convinced that the key to the firm’s success is delivering strong performance, and trusted client service.

Philosophy & Process
At Grisanti Capital Management (GCM), we strive to create long-term capital appreciation by assembling a concentrated portfolio of 15-25 high-quality and undervalued common stocks.  We believe our focus on valuation helps to limit the risk of the portfolio. The companies in the portfolio are predominantly large cap holdings (>90%), with no one position exceeding 8% at the time of purchase.  Our portfolio is not index-driven and does not mimic benchmarks, which is the primary reason for GCM’s long-term record of outperformance.
We want to own quality businesses that generate superior returns and cash flows via modest debt leverage.   We utilize two different methodologies to identify such opportunities.  One is cash flow at a discount, which focuses on earnings or other measures of cash flow that the company will produce in the future to justify a higher share price.  A second feature we look for are assets at discount.  Here we try to identify those companies whose current assets exceed the value of their share price.  This places less emphasis on future growth and more on current value.  We believe our disciplined and repeatable investment process unearths deeply undervalued securities, leading to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long haul.
As with any business, we think success begins with great leaders.  We look for businesses that have a history of share-holder friendly capital allocation, and a management whose long-term goals are aligned with shareholders.  Tightly aligned shareholder and management interests reinforce our conviction level for common stocks added to the portfolio.

December 19, 2016



Chris Grisanti was on Bloomberg Television this morning. Below is a clip from his guest host appearance, in which he discusses macro events, including the election, and their effect on the GCM portfolio.

Will Baker Hughes Walk?



Chris Grisanti was quoted in a Barron’s article about the Baker Hughes dilemma.
 
Will Baker Hughes Walk?
By Vito J. Racanelli
April 9, 2016
The clock has begun ticking in earnest on whether the Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) merger will actually take place. Last Wednesday, both companies said they intended to “vigorously contest” the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit filed the same day, blocking their proposed combination.
Under the terms of the deal, announced in November 2014, when oil-patch conditions were much stronger, either party can walk away from the deal after April 30, 2016. Baker Hughes stock jumped to $43.11 from $39 last week because it stands to get a $3.5 billion termination fee, but the two companies face uncertain futures near term.
Both are in no-win positions. Contesting the Justice Department lawsuit could take many more months in what has already been a long and contentious wait for the deal to close. In the interim, the oil-service business has been mauled by one of the worst downturns in its history and, like the industry, the two companies have suffered.
The courts could rule in favor of the deal or against it, but either way, with potential appeals, it will require some time, further dragging out a process that has taken too long already, distracting and weakening both companies.
Baker Hughes stock rose last week because many investors believe the company will choose to walk and take the termination fee—one fifth of its market value—with it. That’s a nice chunk of change, but probably not enough to make up for the general disruption, employee turnover, and loss of focus and market share that Baker Hughes has endured.
It faces a long mending process. Post-breakup, Baker Hughes will be on its heels as the company prepares to return to independent operations. The shares of both companies could trade down in the short term if the deal officially breaks up. Baker Hughes might find itself with its newfound cash but worse off in the longer term.
“It seems clear that this thing is over and that Baker Hughes will likely walk,” says Christopher Grisanti, a portfolio manager at Grisanti Capital Management, which sold its stakes in both companies in 2015.
There’s been speculation that General Electric (GE) would step in and buy Baker Hughes, but that’s a big bite even for a company the size of GE, given the industry’s woes. Industry balance sheets are stressed, and managers get punished for oil-patch mergers, Grisanti adds.
Last year (in “Baker Hughes Blues,” Nov. 14, 2015), we noted there was a less than 50% chance that the deal would clear regulatory hurdles, and that Baker Hughes could fall another 20% to 30%. Its stock is down 10% since then. We’re closing out this call and taking our chips home. There’s too much uncertainty.
Baker Hughes and Halliburton declined to comment.
It’s rarely a good idea to get involved with stocks when a single government decision can make or break it. Now it looks to be up to a judge, if Baker Hughes doesn’t walk first.

Company Description


Grisanti Capital Management (GCM) primarily focuses on investments in on US equity securities, including common and preferred securities, mainly of large-cap companies, with a value investment perspective. The firm offers two investment approaches for separately managed account clients. In one, the goal is capital appreciation. In the other, called the High Income Equity Portfolio, GCM seeks to achieve a higher income than the US equity market and substantially less volatility than the US equity market as measured by beta, in addition to possible capital appreciation, by using such instruments as high-yielding stocks, high-quality common stocks and common stocks with a higher potential for growth. By conducting fundamental research and analyzing a company’s cash flow and/or assets, the firm seeks to make long-term investments (with a 3- to 4-year horizon) in securities that sell at a meaningful discount either to the value of their future cash flows or to their net asset value. Client portfolios consist of about 15 to 25 stocks. For a few clients, GCM may offer advice on different types of securities such as foreign stock, over-the-counter stock, corporate debt, municipal securities, mutual fund shares and US Government securities. The GCM Opportunity Fund seeks to maximize capital appreciation by investing, on a long and short basis, primarily in US securities where there exist perceived opportunities for either long-term or short-term gain. While not a primary focus, the fund may also invest in non-US securities. GCM seeks to invest the assets of the fund aggressively in order to create the potential for greater returns. While risk is taken into consideration, risk mitigation is not a primary objective of the fund. At times, the investments of the fund may be highly concentrated, with one or more individual investment positions constituting as much as 10% to 20%, or more, of the portfolio. The fund generally has a “long” bias, however it may “go short” certain securities issued by companies where the firm believes the securities have the potential to experience significant price declines. Short positions may also be employed, along with options, for risk management purposes. The fund will utilize leverage in an effort to enhance returns and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise during periods of market turmoil, as well as for other purposes deemed appropriate by GCM.^

 Career History



Founding Member

                                    1999 - Current                


Grisanti Capital Management LLC


                  Grisanti Capital Management (GCM) primarily focuses on investments in on US equity securities, including common and preferred securities, mainly of large-cap companies, with a value investment perspective. The firm offers two investment approaches for separately managed account clients. In one, the goal is capital appreciation. In the other, called the High Income Equity Portfolio, GCM seeks to achieve a higher income than the US equity market and substantially less volatility than the US equity market as measured by beta, in addition to possible capital appreciation, by using such instruments as high-yielding stocks, high-quality common stocks and common stocks with a higher potential for growth. By conducting fundamental research and analyzing a company’s cash flow and/or assets, the firm seeks to make long-term investments (with a 3- to 4-year horizon) in securities that sell at a meaningful discount either to the value of their future cash flows or to their net asset value. Client portfolios consist of about 15 to 25 stocks. For a few clients, GCM may offer advice on different types of securities such as foreign stock, over-the-counter stock, corporate debt, municipal securities, mutual fund shares and US Government securities. The GCM Opportunity Fund seeks to maximize capital appreciation by investing, on a long and short basis, primarily in US securities where there exist perceived opportunities for either long-term or short-term gain. While not a primary focus, the fund may also invest in non-US securities. GCM seeks to invest the assets of the fund aggressively in order to create the potential for greater returns. While risk is taken into consideration, risk mitigation is not a primary objective of the fund. At times, the investments of the fund may be highly concentrated, with one or more individual investment positions constituting as much as 10% to 20%, or more, of the portfolio. The fund generally has a “long” bias, however it may “go short” certain securities issued by companies where the firm believes the securities have the potential to experience significant price declines. Short positions may also be employed, along with options, for risk management purposes. The fund will utilize leverage in an effort to enhance returns and to take advantage of opportunities that may arise during periods of market turmoil, as well as for other purposes deemed appropriate by GCM.^
