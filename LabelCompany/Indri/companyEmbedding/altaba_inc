Yahoo to rename as Altaba Inc with CEO Mayer leaving board
Following the closing of the Yahoo acquisition by Verizon, the remnants of Yahoo will operate under the new moniker of Altaba Inc.

Upon the closing of the $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo's operating business to Verizon, the remaining parts of Yahoo will be renamed to Altaba Inc as it begins its new direction as an investment company.

Complementing the name change will be a new board of directors, with only five individuals claiming a position at the table. Tor Braham, Eric Brandt, Catherine Friedman, Thomas McInerney, and Jeffrey Smith will continue to serve as directors of the company following the acquisition by Verizon, with Brandt serving as chairman of the board.Current Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will miss out on a spot on the new board, and current serving Yahoo board members David Filo, Eddy Hartenstein, Richard Hill, Jane Shaw, and Maynard Webb will also resign, with Webb to be thereafter known as chairman emeritus of the board.In its filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Yahoo also explained that following the closing of the purchase by Verizon, Altaba will be required to register and be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.The multi-billion dollar acquisition  is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, with the purchase by Verizon not including Yahoo's cash, its shares in Alibaba Group Holdings, its shares in Yahoo Japan, or Yahoo's non-core patents, called the Excalibur portfolio. These assets will continue to be held by Altaba. 

"The acquisition of Yahoo will put Verizon in a highly competitive position as a top global mobile media company, and help accelerate our revenue stream in digital advertising," Lowell McAdam, Verizon chairman and CEO said previously.It was previously said that Yahoo's operating business would be integrated with AOL -- scooped up by Verizon for $4.4 billion in 2015 -- under Marni Walden, EVP and president of the Product Innovation and New Businesses organisation at Verizon.With Yahoo disclosing in December that more than 1 billion accounts may have been stolen from company systems in another cyber attack, doubts have been lingering over the heads of Verizon executives. 


Reuters reported earlier this month that the cyber attack -- that actually occurred in August 2013, a year prior to a previously disclosed attack in September 2014 -- left Walden confused. "I can't sit here today and say with confidence one way or another because we still don't know," she is reported to have said at the Citi 2017 Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference in Las Vegas.Mayer said previously she wanted three years to turn the struggling Yahoo around, telling Charlie Rose in a PBS interview last March that her organisation had a strategic plan spanning the same time frame. "I can see how it will work and how we can actually get to a successful turnaround of Yahoo, but I think that, you know, it's about our users and it's about our employees and what's happening with all of them, and I certainly hope that our services are here a year from now and that they run even better than they do today. I can see that that should easily be the outcome," she said.The remarks by the outgoing CEO came after she was asked if she would be running Yahoo a year from March 2015."Yahoo is a company that changed the world. Before Yahoo, the internet was a government research project. Yahoo humanised and popularised the web, email, search, real-time media, and more," Mayer said when previously announcing her intention to stay on after the acquisition.Updated 10 January 2017: Article was originally headlined: Yahoo to rename as Altaba Inc, tweaks board. Added clarification on which part of Yahoo is being renamed.

About ALTABA INC.


   Yahoo! wants to spread some cheer to internet users around the world. Its network of websites offers news, entertainment, and shopping, as well as search results powered by Microsoft's Bing. Yahoo! generates most of its revenue through providing search and display advertising to Web operations in three categories: Communications & Communities (including Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Groups, and Flickr), Search and Marketplaces (Yahoo! Search), and Media (Yahoo! Homepage, Yahoo! Finance). Other revenues come from fee-based services such as premium e-mail; royalties, licenses, and mobile products; and broadband internet access. In June 2017 Verizon closed on its $4.5 billion purchase of Yahoo!.
  
Change in Company Type

   After an extended process, Verizon Communications closed on its  $4.5 billion purchase of Yahoo! in June 2017. The deal was slowed and devalued when Yahoo! revealed several hacking episodes that exposed personal information of millions of its users. Verizon reduced its offer for Yahoo! by $350 million because of the hacking issues. With the transaction concluded, Verizon combined the Yahoo! web operations with its AOL assets into a unit called Oath. Once the most visited web site in the world, Yahoo.com was ranked sixth in web traffic when the deal closed.
Operations

   Yahoo! received about 42% of its revenues from search services in 2015, which it provides through an arrangement with Microsoft. The company is halfway through the 10-year partnership with the software giant. As part of the agreement, Microsoft's Bing search engine is the search provider on Yahoo!'s websites. In addition, Yahoo! handles sales of search ads for both companies, and the two firms share search revenue.
  

   The company is focused on informing, connecting, and entertaining its users with its search (Yahoo Search), communications (including Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Messenger), and digital content products (including Tumblr, and its 4 core verticals: Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Lifestyle).
  
Geographic Reach

   Business outside the Americas accounts for 22% of revenue, but much of the company's total value comes from its Asian assets, worth around $17 billion.
  

   The company continues to manage its business geographically. The Americas contributed 80% of the total revenue in 2015; Asia Pacific (13%); and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), 7%.
  

   Yahoo! owns a majority or 100% of all of its international operations (except in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan where the company has joint ventures and/or non-controlling interests). The company supports these businesses through a network of offices worldwide. In international markets, the company either has its own internal sales professionals or relies on its established sales agency relationships in 35 countries.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company maintains three primary channels for selling its advertising services: field, mid-market, and reseller/small business. Its field advertising sales team sells display advertising in all markets and search advertising services in non-transitioned markets to leading advertisers and agencies. Its field advertising team also sells search advertising to premium advertisers in transitioned markets. Its mid-market channel sells services to medium-sized businesses, while its  reseller/small business channel enables it to sell advertising services to additional regional and small business advertisers. In 2013 Yahoo! reorganized its US sales force.
  

   Yahoo! spent $184 million in 2015 on advertising, up from $142 million and $128 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's net revenue had been decreasing since 2012, followed by 8% growth in 2015. In 2015, Yahoo!'s net revenue increased by 8% to $4.97 billion due to an increase in the Americas segment.
  

   The Americas revenue grew thanks to increases in search and display revenue driven by mobile devices as well as $390 million attributable to the Mozilla Agreement. Americas display revenue also grew thanks to an increase in video and native advertising, including incremental revenue following the BrightRoll acquisition and higher revenue from mobile devices driven by native advertising.
  

   In 2015 Yahoo! posted a net loss of $4.36 billion (compared to net income of $7.52 billion in fiscal 2014), mainly due to increase in goodwill impairment charge, related to the US and Canada, Europe, Tumblr, and Latin America reporting units, and changes in other income (expense), related to changes in the estimated fair value of the Hortonworks warrants (recorded in the previous year as a gain upon Hortonworks' IPO and a gain related to the mark-to-market of the warrants).
  

   The company posted an operating cash outflow of $2.38 billion (compared to operating cash inflow of $0.92 billion in fiscal 2014), mainly due to net loss and changes in working capital (which included the reduction of the income tax liability related to the sale of Alibaba shares in 2014) and earnings in equity interests.
  
Strategy

   Yahoo! is in the midst of a campaign to re-establish its relevancy in the face of fierce competition. A pioneer in Web search and navigation, Yahoo!'s collection of content and services made it an early leader in the Internet world, but Internet giant Google has since eclipsed Yahoo!, having gained nearly 65% of the US search market. (By comparison, Yahoo! has some 15% of global traffic.) In addition, Yahoo! faces competition from younger social network stars Facebook and Twitter, which have become the dominant services for online communication and information sharing.
  

   The company's strategic plan includes improving user and advertiser product quality and growing daily active users, driving continued growth in revenue realized through its Mavens (mobile, video, native and social) and explore asset divestitures. In this context, in 2016 Yahoo! agreed sell its core internet business to Verizon for about $4.8 billion. However, the deal was put in peril when it was revealed that at least 500 million Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014.
  

   (In 2015 Yahoo! had considered spinning off its remaining stake in Alibaba to create a new company which would have included some Yahoo! businesses such as its Internet access business as well as the shares of Alibaba).
  

   In early 2016 Yahoo! announced plans to cut 15% of its workforce (about 1,700 jobs) amid a restructuring to narrow its focus.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2015, the company acquired Polyvore, Inc., (a social commerce website that lets users across the globe discover and shop for their favorite products in fashion, beauty and home décor) for $161 million.
  

   In 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Flurry, Inc., (a mobile data analytics company that optimizes mobile experiences for developers, marketers, and users) for $270 million. The combined scale of Yahoo and Flurry created more personalized app experiences for users and enabled more effective mobile advertising solutions for brands seeking to reach their audiences and gain cross-device insights.
  

   Among its 2014 moves was Yahoo!'s acquisition of BrightRoll, a programmatic video advertising platform in the US. The acquisition makes Yahoo! the largest video advertising platform in the US.

    DEVELOPMENT

 

    Yahoo! continually enhances, expands, and launches products and
    features to meet evolving user, advertiser, and publisher needs
    for technological innovation and a deeper, more integrated
    experience.

 

    Most of our software products and features are developed
    internally.  However, we purchase technology and license
    intellectual property rights when the opportunity is
    strategically aligned, operationally compatible and economically
    advantageous.  We believe that Yahoo! is not materially
    dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties
    relating to product development.

 

    Yahoo! launched its new search marketing system, known as
    Project Panama, in the fourth quarter of 2006.  This system
    provides advertisers with additional tools for budgeting,
    testing, and optimizing their marketing campaigns.  This new
    system also provides a new ranking model launched in early
    February 2007 as the second phase of Project Panama that ranks
    ads by relevance in addition to keyword bid price.  We believe
    the new search marketing system provides a more relevant search
    experience to users, more valuable customer leads to
    advertisers, and additional opportunities to our distribution
    partners.  We have completed the global roll-out of the
    technology across all relevant geographies.

 

    In order to encourage a broad spirit of openness and innovation
    on the Yahoo! network of Websites, we sponsor programs such as
    the Yahoo! Developer network which makes Yahoo!s
    infrastructure, platform, and communities accessible to
    third-parties via APIs.  This has established a mutually
    beneficial environment, in which thousands of developers have
    used and built upon technology from Yahoo! services, including
    Yahoo! Search, Yahoo! Photos, and Yahoo! Maps to further
    increase the relevance of Yahoo! products and services for
    individual users and the greater community.  Another example of
    this effort is the Hack Yahoo! Program, which is designed to
    encourage and empower employee and third-party innovation.  This
    global program consists of a speaker series, an intranet site
    and blog, workshops, and quarterly Hack Days that
    are an ongoing opportunity to foster and celebrate the
    creativity of our employees and third parties.

 

    As a complement to our core engineering and production teams, we
    also have scientists working in our Yahoo! Research Labs
    dedicated to developing novel algorithms and technology that
    empower users, businesses, and

    advertisers worldwide to maximize the social and economic
    potential of the Internet.  Yahoo! performs research to address
    fundamental problems facing users such as: making their search
    for information on the Internet easier and more relevant;
    bringing them tools to help solve their problems; finding new
    and better ways for them to connect and communicate with family
    and community; and guiding family and friends towards
    high-quality products, songs, movies, and other resources.  We
    also use technology to match relevant business services with
    customers most likely to be interested in such services.  Yahoo!
    Research Berkeley is a research facility that operates in a
    partnership between Yahoo! Research Labs and the University of
    California at Berkeley (UCB).  We believe this is a
    mutually beneficial intellectual property arrangement, and an
    opportunity for students and staff at UCB to gain access to
    resource and scale typically not afforded in the academic
    environment.  The mission of Yahoo! Research Berkeley is to
    explore and invent social media and mobile media technology and
    applications that will enable people to create, describe, share,
    find, and remix media on the Web.

 

    Our engineering and production teams are primarily located in
    our Sunnyvale, California headquarters and in Bangalore, India
    and Burbank, California.  Our research teams are located in our
    Sunnyvale, California headquarters and in Berkeley, California;
    Burbank, California; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and
    Santiago, Chile.  We have internally developed, acquired, or
    licensed the products and services we offer.  Product
    development expenses for 2005, 2006, and 2007 totaled
    approximately $570 million, $833 million, and
    $1,084 million, respectively, which included stock-based
    compensation expense of $22 million, $145 million, and
    $218 million, respectively.

    dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties
    relating to product development.

 

    Yahoo! launched its new search marketing system, known as
    Project Panama, in the fourth quarter of 2006. We have been
    transitioning our advertisers on to the new system in the United
    States and will begin transitioning our advertisers in
    international markets in the second quarter of 2007. This system
    provides advertisers with additional tools for budgeting,
    testing and optimizing their marketing campaigns.  This new
    system also provides a new ranking model launched in early
    February 2007 that ranks ads by relevance in addition to keyword
    bid price.  We believe the new search marketing system will
    provide a more relevant search experience to users, more

    Our engineering and production teams are primarily located in
    our Sunnyvale, California headquarters and in Carlsbad,
    California; Burbank, California; Dallas, Texas; and Bangalore,
    India.  Our research teams are located in our Sunnyvale,
    California headquarters and in Berkeley, California; Burbank,
    California; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and Santiago,
    Chile.  We have internally developed, acquired or licensed the
    products and services we offer.  Product development expenses
    for 2004, 2005 and 2006 totaled approximately $381 million,
    $570 million, and $833 million, respectively, which
    included stock-based compensation expense of $12 million,
    $22 million and $145 million, respectively.

 

This excerpt taken from the YHOO 10-Q filed Nov 3, 2006.Product Development.  Product development expenses consist
primarily of compensation related expenses (including stock-based compensation
expense) incurred for enhancements to and maintenance of the Yahoo! Properties,
classification and organization of listings within the Yahoo! Properties, and
research and development, as well as depreciation expense and other operating
costs.

Product
development expenses for the third quarter of 2006 increased $54 million,
or 36 percent, as compared to the same period of 2005.  Product development expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2006 increased $228 million, or 57 percent,
as compared to the same period of 2005. 
Product development expenses include compensation expenses which increased
by approximately $57 million and $209 million for the three and nine month
periods in 2006, respectively, including an additional $31 million and $98
million of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2006, respectively.  Apart
from stock-based compensation expense, the increased compensation expenses
