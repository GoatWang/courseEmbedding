Some of them called to our better angels, some not so much. Some were brilliant, some were barely passable. But, none were as unqualified or as temperamentally unfit as Trump. A minority of Americans, thanks to an archaic election system, elevated a man who is not qualified to even be the mayor of a small town. Let alone be president. 

Here is what the hayseeds believe Donald Trump is going to do.:

1. Destroy the federal government as we know it.
2. Get rid of a bunch of minorities.
3. Get rid of Obamacare and watch the poor die. My previously unaffordable insurance is down to just $85/month.  My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. Under Trump, healthcare will be $500/month or more.
4. Make the lives of poor kids, the sick, and the elderly worse than they already are.
5. Drop a bunch of bombs on some colored people in some country somewhere.
6. Cut taxes on the rich.

It's not a partisan issue, as he's not really a Republican, it's the person. He's a narcissist who can't abide criticism and has no empathy for others, a petty and vindictive man. A person with no intellectual curiosity, who doesn't read and doesn't want to learn how to do his job. He also lacks a moral compass, he's neither decent nor honorable. He'll be a "blot" in US history.Join the Conversation1 / 51k

American Fiber Green Products, Inc. Company Profile

   The recycled fiberglass molding to be made by American Fiber Green Products will come in more colors than green.

WHY DO I NEED FIBER?















Fiber is a material containing substances that are resistant to the action of digestive enzymes. Fiber adds bulk and texture to foods. As it passes through the body, fiber helps your system stay regular, and that’s why many doctors recommend fiber to help manage constipation.






When it comes to your health, fiber helps prevent your stool from becoming excessively loose, or dry and hard. If you suffer from diarrhea, the bulk that fiber creates may lead to larger stools that pass through your body a little slower. If you suffer from constipation, fiber can help bulk up your stools so they are easier to eliminate - which can speed things up a bit.









The most important thing about fiber? It helps regulate your system naturally.
























Why Do I Need Fiber?
 












Fiber & Your Health
 












Types of Fiber
 












Fiber & Your Diet
 










FIBER THERAPY
Fiber therapy is a convenient and effective way for you to boost your fiber intake in order to relieve constipation by restoring and maintaining regularity. Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber contains 100% soluble fiber, which means it will give your stool a softer, bulkier consistency that's easier to pass. You get all the benefits of fiber, but without excess gas!**






**Based on laboratory testing. Individual results may vary.







How long can Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber be used? Can I use it every day?






Laxative products, including Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber, shouldn't be used for longer than one week unless you're directed to do so by your physician. If you encounter a situation in which you find that you need a product like Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber for a longer period of time, we would recommend that you contact your doctor for advice on the possible causes of the situation and courses of action.
Additionally, the suggested one-week duration for using the product serves to make consumers aware that an on-going problem, such as persistent constipation, warrants medical attention. If appropriate, a physician may advise you to use the product on a daily basis. Consult your doctor to determine if a more regimented use of Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber supplement is appropriate for you.








What is the difference between the psyllium fiber in Metamucil and the methylcellulose fiber in Citrucel®?






Fiber is the non-digestible portion of plant foods that plays a critical role in digestion. There are two different categories that all fiber products fall into: 1) soluble or insoluble, and 2) fermentable or non-fermentable.
Soluble fiber dissolves in water, whereas insoluble fiber does not. The fiber in Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber is 100% soluble; the psyllium fiber in Metamucil is not 100% soluble.
Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber contains only 100% non-fermentable fiber, so none of it ferments to cause excess gas like the fermentable fiber in Metamucil. This is based on laboratory tests. Results may vary.

FIBER & YOUR HEALTH












FIBER AND REGULARITY
Unlike the psyllium in some fiber products, which ferments in the large intestine, methylcellulose doesn't ferment and will not cause excess gas. Plus, methylcellulose fiber is non-allergenic and gluten-free!
FIBER CAN HELP MANAGE CONSTIPATION
Fiber is not digested by the body and this allows the material in the digestive tract to take on bulk and a soft texture as it passes through the body. Fiber also helps keep stool from being excessively dry and hard. These softer, bulkier stools are easier to pass, so if you suffer from constipation, a fiber therapy product can help keep things moving. Refer back to doctor with questions.
FIBER AND GAS
Almost all types of soluble fiber can ferment in your digestive system and cause excess gas. And if you’re taking a fermentable fiber supplement like psyllium to improve regularity, you may experience excess gas.
So if you experience constipation, Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber is proven to help relieve constipation by restoring and maintaining regularity, and it’s also the only fiber that won’t ferment or cause excess gas.**

**Based on laboratory testing. Individual results may vary.








How long does it take Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber to work?






Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber can take anywhere between 12 and 72 hours to take effect.








How do Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber caplets compare to the powder in their fiber content?






Each two-caplet dose of Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber caplets contains one gram of methylcellulose. This compares to two grams of Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber in each one-scoop dose. In other words, you will need to take four caplets to get the same amount of fiber that is in one scoop Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber powder. Four caplets can be taken at the same time. We recommend that you drink 8 oz. of liquid with each dose of 2-4 caplets.








How long can Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber be used? Can I use it every day?






Laxative products, including Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber, shouldn’t be used for longer than one week unless you’re directed to do so by your physician. If you encounter a situation in which you find that you need a product like Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber for a longer period of time, we would recommend that you contact your doctor for advice on the possible causes of the situation and courses of action.
Additionally, the suggested one-week duration for using the product serves to make consumers aware that an on-going problem, such as persistent constipation, warrants medical attention. If appropriate, a physician may advise you to use the product on a daily basis. Consult your doctor to determine if a more regimented use of Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber is appropriate for you.








How do the carbs and calories in one dose of Citrucel® Powder compare with that of Citrucel® Caplets?






Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber Regular Orange - 17g carbs and 60 calories
Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber Sugar-Free Orange - 8g carbs and 24 calories
Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber Caplets (2 caplet dose) - 0 carbs, 5 calories








I have a hard time swallowing the caplets. Can I chew, crush, or cut Citrucel® caplets?






Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber caplets are not designed to be chewed. Crushing or cutting the caplet is acceptable and will not impact the therapeutic value of Citrucel® with Methylcellulose Fiber caplets.

To have and maintain a healthy head of hair, there are many products available to help you accomplish just that. shampoos, conditioners, styling and cutting tools, hair brushes and much more all might become part of your daily ritual to keep your hair looking good. With low prices, every day, on everything, you can get the hair care supplies you need for less. Here's how to figure out what you need.ShampoosNo matter what type of hair you have, there's a shampoo just for you. There are shampoos specific to men's, women's and children's hair. Other hair conditions that shampoo can improve include dandruff, oily hair or frizzy hair. If you have dry or damaged hair, there are hydrating shampoos that can reverse the damage. Fine, thin hair is easy to protect and improve through the use of shampoos designed to add volume and texture. For simplicity, there are also shampoos and conditioners combined into one product.ConditionersConditioners help maintain various types of hair as well. If you have color-treated hair, it helps to use a conditioner that maintains the color and retains the treatment longer. All types of hair can benefit from the proper conditioner, including curly, frizzy, thick, long, straight, dry, oily and fine hair. Some conditioners are those that you massage into your hair, then rinse out immediately. Some, you massage in and leave in for a few minutes. There are even some conditioners that require you to leave them in overnight, especially if you have damaged or heat-styled hair.Hair coloring productsWhen choosing hair coloring products, the two most common reasons are to change the color of your hair or to address a specific issue, such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair. Although hair coloring can be gender- and age-specific, most people can use any type of hair coloring. Some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color, much like you'd with shampoo. When coloring your hair, the time involved is directly related to how much you're changing the color. If you're just changing your shade slightly, the time involved is minimal. However, if you're going dark brown to light blonde, for example, there are several steps involved and a great deal of time involved. There are also temporary hair colors you can add in, representing many assorted colors   including those not normally found on hair   that naturally wash out after several showers.Styling productsProbably no tool is more important when it comes to styling hair than the hair dryer. These powerful devices allow you to both blow dry your hair and style it at the same time. hair dryers reduce the amount of time it takes to dry your hair by a great deal. Hair dryers are available by the amount of wattage they use and what type of accessories they have. Many hair dryers run on 1,875 watts but can have fewer than 1,000 watts and more than 2,000 watts. If you use curlers or prefer that salon-like feeling while at home, there are also bonnet-style hair dryers that cover your head completely.A couple of other key styling tools for hair are curling irons and flat irons. Although they work much the same way, one makes small or large curls, and the other one flattens and straightens hair   both with heat. Both types of irons are available in varied sizes, with most being between 3/4 of an inch to 2 inches wide. Larger sizes work best on thicker hair.Other hair care productsAll of the styling you want to do with your hair is much easier with a good hair brush or comb to remove tangles and smooth things out. Some common types include natural, synthetic and mixed bristle brushes that are either paddle, vented, round, teasing or wet brushes. Bristle brushes are good for using with long hair, and synthetic or mixed bristle brushes don't create as much static as natural bristle brushes. Natural bristle brushes are soft and help spread your hair's natural oils throughout your hair, making it look shiny.Paddle brushes are flat and wide and work well when doing a blowout on your hair. Vented brushes, with their increased airflow, help cut down drying time even more. Round brushes also work well when doing a blowout and help create extra volume. Teasing brushes allow you to tease the ends of your hair in different styles for more volume. Rattail combs make it easier for you to section hair for braids and other styles. Wide-tooth combs are easier on your hair when it's wet and reduce breakage.For holding hair in place, you can use barrettes, French combs, claw clips, snap clips, headbands, bobby pins or elastic bands. These allow you to hold your hair in different styles, such as ponytails, pigtails, updos and French twists.Show moreElectrode, Comp-138129719, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

ECS Carbon Fiber Side Blade Set: Add a touch of style made with real carbon fiber to your Audi ... 


                        Upgrade your exterior styling with the ECS Tuning Carbon Fiber Side Blade Set. These exclusive side blades were engineered and designed in-house to add a more sporty appearance to your vehicle that matches with the factory appeal of the B8 A4 & S4. Our inspiration                        
                             for these came from the earlier B6/B7 S-line door flares where they would flare out more towards the rear edge of each blade. Keeping the same style in mind we carried those characteristics into the new ECS Carbon Fiber Side Blade Set. Each side blade is crafted of high quality hand laid carbon fiber to achieve it's world class appearance and durability and provides an aggressive and sporty style that's sure to set your vehicle apart from the rest.For vehicles with factory side blades, carefully remove the side blades by separating the tape holding them to the vehicle and then sliding the blade assembly towards the rear of the vehicle to release the clips. Clean the area of and tape residue and dirt, transfer over or install new securing clips, and slide the Carbon Fiber Side blade in place. Do not remove the liner of the tape until the side blade is sitting in it's final position to ease installation.  A full set of new securing clips is available if needed as es3170900.   To compliment the look of your new side blades, check out the ECS Carbon Fiber Trunk Spoiler and Diffuser, only available from ECS Tuning.*Installation on vehicles without factory side blades will require custom modification by the end user. We DO NOT recommend installing the side blades with only adhesive tape.  Fits: Audi A4, Audi S4.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
