I was a skeptic when it came to working with a factoring company. Working in the industry for the last 20+ years, everyone has heard the horror stories. So when it came time to grow and find a strategic partner, we chose Interstate Capital Corp. We had several conversations and meetings with JR. He took the time to understand not only how we conduct our business but helped us evaluate our customer’s aging and credit terms before we became a client. JR offered multiple solutions for our needs. In fact, it forced us to look at our accounting procedures and we found a solution that helped increase our profitability and minimize expenses. Their entire team is friendly and knowledgeable. Signing up was extremely easy, and ICC appointed the perfect representative for our account. I am impressed with their technology, ease of doing business and all the additional free perks they offer.Jacob B.

Interstate Capital clients continually report greater levels of satisfaction with the services and the staff at Interstate Capital as compared to their experiences with other factoring companies. What makes Interstate Capital stand out in the factoring industry? Here are five differences that set Interstate Capital above other factoring companies – and that create a superior factoring experience for clients.1 Faster funding
As a well-funded, independent factoring company, Interstate Capital makes application and funding decisions quickly and efficiently with no outside interference. Streamlined verification processes and state-of-the-art proprietary programs speed payment on invoices to clients for same-day funding and usually within two hours of invoice submission. Very few factoring companies can deliver funding this fast.2 Experience
Founded in 1993, Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s most established factoring companies. It has stood the test of time and continues to follow the high ethical standards and fair business practices set by its parent financial services company more than 70 years ago. Unlike the crowd of less experienced factoring companies, Interstate Capital has thrived through different economic cycles and business environments.3 Size
Size does count when you are looking for a one-stop-shop with professionals in every area of factoring services: account management, credit, collections, accounts receivable, invoice processing, and other departments. A company with a large staff indicates stability, experience, and a track record of growth. With more than 100 factoring specialists, Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s largest factoring companies and home to top talent and resources not found in the typical factoring company.  With its depth of financial expertise and experienced factoring professionals, Interstate Capital can go further to support its clients’ business goals.4 Specialization
Because Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s largest factoring companies, its staff includes many professionals who specialize in
your industry.

With its diversification, Interstate Capital brings the best practices of different industries when customizing the right factoring program for you. Many factoring companies handle only one industry or employ only generalists without Interstate Capital’s depth of expertise.5 Services

These services include 24/7 funding, advances up to 100%, Interstate Mobile App for scanning and uploading funding documents, professional credit checks and consultation, outstanding collections services, one-on-one training on 24/7 client portal, free ACH deposits, one free wire transfer a week, discount cards and discount programs for select clients, and much more.Start your successful cash flow journey with Interstate Capital today by getting an instant factoring rate quote.By submitting this form, you consent to receive calls and text messages (including via an automatic telephone dialing system) by or on behalf of Interstate Capital Corporation (Interstate Capital), and any of its partners or affiliates using any telephone number you provide to explore if factoring and related services may benefit your business.

 Retired - Arkansas Financial Group           IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE INFORMATION RetiredThe Spangersons have grown uncomfortable with the complexity of the financial markets and are looking for professional help to ensure a consistent revenue stream.Bob and Ruth Spangerson* are both retired physicians who have been married for thirty-eight years. They both retired two years ago, but have grown uncomfortable with their ability to manage their investments to produce a dependable income stream. Financial markets have posed real challenges in creating yield in their portfolio and they are concerned that they may be doing more harm than good after simply using high dividend stocks and watching the values decline and some of the dividends themselves get cut. They feel it is time to turn their portfolio over to a professional to manage their assets so that they can finally travel and enjoy life.They are concerned about how to pass on their estate to their two sons and one daughter and want to know how to help a charity in Honduras they’ve spent years serving.OverviewDr. Bob SpangersonAge 68Retired AnesthesiologistDr. Ruth SpangersonAge 68Retired General SurgeonFamily FinancesHome at $778,000Home mortgage of $63,000, 3.5% w/ 5 years leftRuth’s Retirement Plan balance $3,657,000Bob’s Retirement Plan balance $2,704,000Joint Investment Account balance $2,308,000Bob and Ruth’s ConcernsHow much they can afford to spend without stressing their portfolio and running out of money? They are guessing that they spend about $30,000 per month.Should their funds be invested to fund their monthly cash flow needs.Do they need to update their estate plans, to make sure the outcomes of various scenarios are consistent with their values.How We Helped the Drs. SpangersonTaking into account their Social Security income along with portfolio income, we determined that they could spend $36,328 per month if markets perform at historical levels. However, if markets perform more poorly than historical norms, their portfolio would only sustain a withdrawal rate of $27,891 per month, a 23.2% reduction. Were they to actually spend at the $30,000 level, they would likely run out of funds at age 96. Because they were concerned that high income taxpayers could see a reduction in Social Security benefits, we re-ran our calculations without Social Security benefits. As this chart demonstrates, were this to happen, and if poor market conditions persisted, they would likely run out of funds at age 91. To offset this loss of income, they would need to spend at a monthly level of $24,258 (an additional reduction of 13.0%). In order to help them build clarity and ease into their expense monitoring process, we referred the Spangersons to a CFP® Practitioner who specializes in helping clients establish cash flow infrastructures. She uses a number of newer technologies to make the process more transparent and controllable. Clients have a better feel for their spending levels and have the tools at their fingertips to know where they stand.Using recent historical asset class data, their present portfolio had an expected return of 9.38% and had a potential downside return of -16.28%. Individual Risk Profiles were developed for both Ruth and Bob and then a joint profile was developed for them. Their combined profile indicated a loss willingness of no more than 12%. Their current portfolio characteristics are in green on this chart; their optimal portfolio is shown in navy. Their new allocation by broad categories is shown in the following pie chart.With the recent changes in Estate Tax Rates, the Spangersons should not have estate taxes due under their present Will/Trust structure. Yet their goal of supporting their charity in Honduras might be achieved without impairing their cash flow needs, their income tax situation or their ultimate estate wishes by utilizing a Charitable Remainder Trust. With about $2,400,000 of their portfolio situated in Bonds, a portion of these could be shifted into an Annuity Trust form of CRT and a fixed rate paid out each year. Their Attorney and CPA reviewed the facts and options and recommended that a 6% CRAT using their joint lives be used, funded by a $1,000,000 gift. This gave them a current income tax deduction, a guaranteed cash flow from the CRAT and the comfort that the charity would be funded with the principal after their deaths.*These case studies illustrate the hypothetical experiences of fictitious clients based on a common scenario our clients have experienced.

About Southern Financial Group
Southern Financial Group, Inc. educates individuals who seriously want to be prudent with their money.
Today there are approximately 746,000 licensed financial representatives in this country representing over 7,000 banks, nearly 1,000 brokerage firms, and 2,300 insurance companies. The numbers of public accountants and lawyers are legion. Yet with all the benefits of “professional” assistance in navigating through the maze of tax laws, and the fine print on financial products and risk variables in investment prospectuses, the individual person feels betrayed and vulnerable more than ever before. Unfortunately, the financial services industry is filled with those who would advise you to take unnecessary risk with your money.
What makes Southern Financial Group, Inc. any different? First and foremost, we believe that it is more important that you understand HOW money works before choosing a specific financial product. We put an emphasis on educating our clients about the three types of money: Accumulated, Lifestyle, and Transferred money. Most people narrowly focus on accumulated money, when the real culprit in preventing them from building long term wealth is transferred money. Transferred money is money that you most likely are transferring away unknowingly and unnecessarily. We believe the first place to start is by eliminating these unnecessary wealth transfers.
Gaining the knowledge of how to recapture the money you are currently losing unknowingly and unnecessarily is a prudent goal before you consider taking on more risk. The two largest wealth transfers are taxes and your mortgage. Focusing on increasing wealth through making higher returns on your investments is the equivalent of trying to fill a bucket with holes by pouring more in. Would you do that? Of course not. First, plug the holes and the bucket will fill even if the flow is just a trickle. So, how do you plug the holes in your financial bucket? Avoiding unnecessary transfers is a great place to begin.
One must also understand the power of leverage, and having complete liquidity, use, and control of your money TODAY. Lastly, it is imperative to understand opportunity cost. Once you understand these fundamental truths, you will learn to make your one dollar earn ten, instead of what Wall Street has taught us which is to make ten dollars earn one.

I was a skeptic when it came to working with a factoring company. Working in the industry for the last 20+ years, everyone has heard the horror stories. So when it came time to grow and find a strategic partner, we chose Interstate Capital Corp. We had several conversations and meetings with JR. He took the time to understand not only how we conduct our business but helped us evaluate our customer’s aging and credit terms before we became a client. JR offered multiple solutions for our needs. In fact, it forced us to look at our accounting procedures and we found a solution that helped increase our profitability and minimize expenses. Their entire team is friendly and knowledgeable. Signing up was extremely easy, and ICC appointed the perfect representative for our account. I am impressed with their technology, ease of doing business and all the additional free perks they offer.Jacob B.

Interstate Capital clients continually report greater levels of satisfaction with the services and the staff at Interstate Capital as compared to their experiences with other factoring companies. What makes Interstate Capital stand out in the factoring industry? Here are five differences that set Interstate Capital above other factoring companies – and that create a superior factoring experience for clients.1 Faster funding
As a well-funded, independent factoring company, Interstate Capital makes application and funding decisions quickly and efficiently with no outside interference. Streamlined verification processes and state-of-the-art proprietary programs speed payment on invoices to clients for same-day funding and usually within two hours of invoice submission. Very few factoring companies can deliver funding this fast.2 Experience
Founded in 1993, Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s most established factoring companies. It has stood the test of time and continues to follow the high ethical standards and fair business practices set by its parent financial services company more than 70 years ago. Unlike the crowd of less experienced factoring companies, Interstate Capital has thrived through different economic cycles and business environments.3 Size
Size does count when you are looking for a one-stop-shop with professionals in every area of factoring services: account management, credit, collections, accounts receivable, invoice processing, and other departments. A company with a large staff indicates stability, experience, and a track record of growth. With more than 100 factoring specialists, Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s largest factoring companies and home to top talent and resources not found in the typical factoring company.  With its depth of financial expertise and experienced factoring professionals, Interstate Capital can go further to support its clients’ business goals.4 Specialization
Because Interstate Capital is one of the industry’s largest factoring companies, its staff includes many professionals who specialize in
your industry. Unlike small companies that employ only generalists who create one-size-fits-all factoring programs, Interstate Capital has knowledgeable specialists who can deliver customized cash flow solutions that address your company’s unique factoring needs and business model. With its diversification, Interstate Capital brings the best practices of different industries when customizing the right factoring program for you. Many factoring companies handle only one industry or employ only generalists without Interstate Capital’s depth of expertise.5 Services
After working with thousands of clients across many industries over nearly 25 years, Interstate Capital has developed a diverse menu of client services and benefits unmatched by other factoring companies. These services include 24/7 funding, advances up to 100%, Interstate Mobile App for scanning and uploading funding documents, professional credit checks and consultation, outstanding collections services, one-on-one training on 24/7 client portal, free ACH deposits, one free wire transfer a week, discount cards and discount programs for select clients, and much more.Start your successful cash flow journey with Interstate Capital today by getting an instant factoring rate quote.By submitting this form, you consent to receive calls and text messages (including via an automatic telephone dialing system) by or on behalf of Interstate Capital Corporation (Interstate Capital), and any of its partners or affiliates using any telephone number you provide to explore if factoring and related services may benefit your business.
