Genco Shipping & Trading Limited Announces First Quarter Financial ResultsBack to GNK News

Share Story4:34PM ET 5/08/2017 Globe NewswireNEW YORK, May  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE:GNK) ("Genco" or the "Company") today reported its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The following financial review discusses the results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.
First Quarter 2017 and Year-to-Date Highlights
Recorded a net loss of $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2017Basic and diluted loss per share of $0.47
Adjusted basic and diluted loss of $22.0 million or $0.66 per share, excluding $6.4 million for gain on sale of vessels1

During the first quarter of 2017 we delivered four vessels to buyersSold the Genco Wisdom, the Genco Carrier, the Genco Reliance and the Genco Success for total net proceeds of $12.7 million, which were recorded as cash on the balance sheet

Expect to sell the Genco Prosperity, the last of the ten vessels identified for sale, for total net proceeds of $2.9 millionAnticipate the vessel to be delivered to buyers by May 20, 2017, and net proceeds to be recorded as cash on the balance sheet  


_____________________
1 We believe the non-GAAP measure presented provides investors with a means of better evaluating and understanding the Company's operating performance.
Financial Review: 2017 First Quarter
The Company recorded a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $15.6 million, or $0.47 basic and diluted net loss per share. Comparatively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $54.5 million, or $7.55 basic and diluted net loss per share. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016 has been adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split of Genco's common stock effected on July 7, 2016.
John C. Wobensmith, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "During the first quarter, our focus remained on further enhancing the Company's commercial strategy and advancing Genco's position as a leading low-cost operator. Specifically, we have taken steps during the quarter to strengthen our chartering team to further enhance our commercial prospects focusing on both major and minor bulks, improve the age profile of our fleet and maintain a low breakeven level. As supply and demand fundamentals continue to come into balance, we believe Genco is well positioned to take advantage of a market recovery due to our improved platform and significant operating leverage. Our financial flexibility also provides the Company the potential to pursue compelling growth opportunities for shareholders."
The Company's revenues increased to $38.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $20.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher spot market rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year partially offset by the operation of fewer vessels during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
The average daily time charter equivalent, or TCE, rates obtained by the Company's fleet was $6,498 per day for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $2,629 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in TCE was primarily due to higher spot rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016. During January and February of 2017, the drybulk market experienced various seasonal events that pressured freight rates, including increased newbuilding vessel deliveries, weather related disruptions and the Chinese New Year holiday. In March, however, freight rates found support led by heightened Chinese demand for iron ore cargoes particularly from Brazil due to augmented Chinese steel production, increased coal shipments to China as well as the onset of the South American grain season. Specifically, on March 29, 2017 the BDI reached a year-to-date high of 1,338, with Capesize freight rates, as quoted by the Baltic Exchange, trading significantly higher than the same point of last year.
Total operating expenses were $46.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $67.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Vessel operating expenses declined to $24.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $29.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the operation of fewer vessels during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year. This decrease was also due to lower expenses related to crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares partially offset by higher drydocking related expenses. General and administrative expenses were $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in non-cash compensation expenses. Included in general and administrative expenses is nonvested stock amortization expense of $0.7 million and $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $18.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $20.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the revaluation of ten of our vessels to their estimated net realizable value during the first half of 2016.
Daily vessel operating expenses, or DVOE, decreased to $4,395 per vessel per day for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $4,573 per vessel per day for the same quarter of 2016 predominantly due to lower expenses related to crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares partially offset by higher drydocking related expenses. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12‑month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. Furthermore, based on estimates provided by our technical managers and management's views, our DVOE budget for 2017 is $4,440 per vessel per day on a weighted average basis for the entire year for the core fleet of 60 vessels.
Apostolos Zafolias, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Genco continues to maintain a strong financial foundation, ending the first quarter with $174 million in cash. Our continued focus on cost-saving initiatives has enabled Genco to significantly lower its cash breakeven levels, which are among the lowest in the industry. We believe our low-cost structure, as well as our significant liquidity position, will serve the Company well in a drybulk recovery."
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow
Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $6.0 million and $27.3 million, respectively.  Included in the net loss during the three months ended March 31, 2016 are $1.7 million of non-cash impairment charges. Also included in the net loss during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of non-cash amortization of non-vested stock compensation related to Genco's 2014 Management Incentive Plan. There was also a gain on sale of vessels in the amount of $6.4 million due to the sale of four vessels and paid in kind interest of $1.5 million related to the $400 Million Credit Facility during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.2 million due to the sale or scrapping of nine vessels during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Additionally, the fluctuation in prepaid expense and other current assets decreased by $1.3 million due to the timing of prepaid payments made.  Lastly, there was a $2.8 million increase in deferred drydocking costs incurred because there were more vessels that completed drydocking during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period during 2016.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $13.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The increase is primarily due to $12.6 million of proceeds from the sale of four vessels during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Additionally, there was a decrease in deposits of restricted cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of the release of $0.6 million of restricted cash for required capital expenditures for our vessels.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million for the proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 million and $18.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities of $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 consisted primarily of the following: $1.0 million payment of Series A Preferred Stock issuance costs; $0.7 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities; and $0.1 million repayment of debt under the $400 Million Credit Facility.  Net cash used in financing activities of $18.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted primarily of the following: $10.2 million repayment of debt under the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $3.0 million repayment of debt under the $148 Million Credit Facility, $1.9 million repayment of debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $1.6 million repayment of debt under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, $0.7 million repayment of debt under $44 Million Term Loan Facility, $0.7 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities; and $0.4 million repayment of debt under the $22 Million Term Loan Facility.  On November 15, 2016, the $400 Million Credit Facility refinanced the following six credit facilities: the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, the $148 Million Credit Facility, the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, the $44 Million Term Loan Facility and the $22 Million Term Loan Facility.
Capital Expenditures
We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with vessel acquisitions. As of May 8, 2017, our fleet consists of 13 Capesize, six Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, two Handymax and 15 Handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,735,000 dwt.  
In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet. Six of our vessels were drydocked during the first quarter of 2017. We currently expect nine of our vessels to be drydocked during the remainder of 2017 of which six are expected to be drydocked during the second quarter of 2017.
We estimate our capital expenditures related to drydocking for our fleet through 2017 to be:
 
Q2 2017
Q3-Q4 2017
Estimated Costs (1)
$5.1 million
$2.4 million
Estimated Offhire Days (2)
120
60

(1) Estimates are based on our budgeted cost of drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash from operations. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses or potential costs associated with the installation of ballast water treatment systems.
(2) Actual length will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors.
Six vessels drydocked during the first quarter of 2017. The planned offhire days recorded for these vessels during the first quarter of 2017 amounted to 102.4 days. Capitalized costs associated with drydocking incurred during the first quarter of 2017 were approximately $2.8 million.

1) EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus net interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings. For these reasons, we believe that EBITDA is a useful measure to present to our investors. EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e. non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies.2) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.3) We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period.4) We define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels between time charters. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues.5) We define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues.6) We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning.7) We define TCE rates as our net voyage revenue (voyage revenues less voyage expenses (including voyage expenses to Parent)) divided by the number of our available days during the period, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts.8) We define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance expenses relating to repairs and maintenance (excluding drydocking), the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.
Genco Shipping & Trading Limited's Fleet
Genco Shipping & Trading Limited transports iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes. As of May 8, 2017, Genco Shipping & Trading Limited's fleet consists of 13 Capesize, six Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, two Handymax and 15 Handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,735,000 dwt.
Our current fleet contains 16 groups of sister ships, which are vessels of virtually identical sizes and specifications. We believe that maintaining a fleet that includes sister ships reduces costs by creating economies of scale in the maintenance, supply and crewing of our vessels. As of May 8, 2017, the average age of our current fleet was 9.3 years.

(1) The charter expiration dates presented represent the earliest dates that our charters may be terminated in the ordinary course. Under the terms of each contract, the charterer is entitled to extend the time charter from two to four months in order to complete the vessel's final voyage plus any time the vessel has been off-hire.(2) Time charter rates presented are the gross daily charterhire rates before third-party brokerage commission generally ranging from 1.25% to 6.25%. In a time charter, the charterer is responsible for voyage expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents' fees and canal dues.(3) We have agreed to an extension with Swissmarine Services S.A. on a spot market-related time charter for 8.5 to 12.5 months at a rate based on 106% of the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI), published by the Baltic Exchange, as reflected in daily reports. Hire is paid every 15 days in arrears less a 5.00% third-party brokerage commission. The extension is expected to begin on or about June 3, 2017.(4) We have reached an agreement with Louis Dreyfus Company Freight Asia Pte. Ltd. on a time charter for 4.5 to 8 months at a rate of $12,000 per day. Hire is paid every 15 days in advance less a 5.00% third-party brokerage commission. The vessel delivered to charterers on March 6, 2017 after completion of drydocking for scheduled maintenance. The vessel had redelivered to Genco on February 23, 2017.(5) We have reached an agreement with Koch Shipping Pte. Ltd. on a time charter for 5 to 8.5 months at a rate of $15,300 per day. Hire is paid every 15 days in advance less a 5.00% third-party brokerage commission. The vessel is expected to deliver to charterers on or about May 19, 2017. The vessel has not been delivered to the charterer by the date specified in the agreement, and the charterer therefore has the option through the date of the vessel's readiness to cancel the agreement.(6) We have reached an agreement with Cargill International S.A. on a time charter for 9 to 12.5 months at a rate of $15,350 per day. Hire is paid every 15 days in advance less a 5.00% third-party brokerage commission.

"Safe Harbor" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements use words such as "anticipate," "budget," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of potential future events, circumstances or future operating or financial performance.  These forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and observations. Included among the factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this report are the following: (i) further declines or sustained weakness in demand in the drybulk shipping industry; (ii) continuation of weakness or further declines in drybulk shipping rates; (iii) changes in the supply of or demand for drybulk products, generally or in particular regions; (iv) changes in the supply of drybulk carriers including newbuilding of vessels or lower than anticipated scrapping of older vessels; (v) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the cargo industry, including, without limitation, legislation adopted by international organizations or by individual countries and actions taken by regulatory authorities; (vi) increases in costs and expenses including but not limited to: crew wages, insurance, provisions, lube, oil, bunkers, repairs, maintenance and general, administrative, and management fee expenses; (vii) whether our insurance arrangements are adequate; (viii) changes in general domestic and international political conditions; (ix) acts of war, terrorism, or piracy; (x) changes in the condition of the Company's vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards (which may affect, among other things, our anticipated drydocking or maintenance and repair costs) and unanticipated drydock expenditures; (xi) the Company's acquisition or disposition of vessels; (xii) the amount of offhire time needed to complete repairs on vessels and the timing and amount of any reimbursement by our insurance carriers for insurance claims, including offhire days; (xiii) the completion of definitive documentation with respect to charters; (xiv) charterers' compliance with the terms of their charters in the current market environment; (xv) the extent to which our operating results continue to be affected by weakness in market conditions and charter rates; (xvi) our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operation, to obtain and maintain acceptable terms with our vendors, customers and service providers and to retain key executives, managers and employees; and other factors listed from time to time in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, without limitation, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Our ability to pay dividends in any period will depend upon various factors, including the limitations under any credit agreements to which we may be a party, applicable provisions of Marshall Islands law and the final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance. The timing and amount of dividends, if any, could also be affected by factors affecting cash flows, results of operations, required capital expenditures, or reserves.  As a result, the amount of dividends actually paid may vary.  We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Genco Shipping & Trading Limited Announces Third Quarter Financial ResultsBack to GNK Snapshot

Share Story4:32PM ET 11/02/2016 Globe NewswireNEW YORK, Nov.  02, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK) ("Genco" or the "Company") today reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.
The following financial review discusses the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Third Quarter 2016 and Year-to-Date Highlights Recorded a net loss attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited of $27.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 Basic and diluted loss per share of $3.80Extended and amended the commitment and waiver letter for the $400.0 million facility through November 15, 2016 Provides further amortization relief for 2019 and 2020Includes improved collateral maintenance covenants for 2020Designed to refinance all of our existing credit facilities with the exception of the $98 Million Credit Facility and the 2014 Term Loan FacilitiesEntered into agreements with the Company's three largest shareholders and other investors for the purchase of an aggregate of $125 million of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $4.85 per share On October 4, 2016 entered into agreements with the three largest shareholders of the Company for the firm purchase commitment of $86.4 million and a backstop commitment for $38.6 millionOn October 27, 2016 entered into an agreement with a number of investors including our three largest shareholders for a firm purchase of $38.6 millionSold two Handysize vessels, the Genco Sugar and the Genco Pioneer for $5.1 millionEntered into an agreement to sell the Genco Leader for $3.47 millionEffected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of Genco's common stock as of July 7, 2016.Financial Review: 2016 Third Quarter The Company recorded a net loss attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited for the third quarter of 2016 of $27.5 million, or $3.80 basic and diluted net loss per share. Comparatively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net loss attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited of $66.6 million, or $9.54 basic and diluted net loss per share. Basic and diluted net loss per share for both periods has been adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split of Genco's common stock effected on July 7, 2016. John C. Wobensmith, President, commented, "Genco has taken important steps to strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its long-term prospects in the third quarter. The proposed $400 million facility provides us with a more favorable amortization schedule through 2020, a reduction in the minimum liquidity requirements and significant relief under the collateral maintenance covenants which is expected to provide the company with increased financial flexibility upon closing.  The commitment for the proposed $400 million credit facility highlights the Company's industry leadership and is expected to better position the Company to capitalize on our leading drybulk platform during a potential market recovery. We thank our lenders for their strong and ongoing support." The Company's revenues decreased to $38.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $50.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower spot market rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the third quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year. The average daily time charter equivalent, or TCE, rates obtained by the Company's fleet was $5,779 per day for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $7,009 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in TCE was primarily due to lower spot rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet during the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, the Baltic Dry Index continued to increase from all-time lows registered earlier in the year. Freight rates during the quarter were primarily supported by heightened demand for iron ore cargoes due to augmented Chinese steel production and increased coal shipments to China as the country reduced domestic coal output. With regard to supply, net fleet growth in the year-to-date remained relatively low in historical terms, however vessel demolition activity eased during the third quarter as compared to the first half of the year. Total operating expenses were $59.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $85.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Vessel operating expenses declined to $28.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $31.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to lower expenses related to maintenance, crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares. General, administrative and technical management expenses were $10.2 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.0 million for the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in compensation and merger related expenses partially offset by costs related to financing or refinancing activities. Included in general, administrative and technical management expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015, are non-cash compensation expenses of $3.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively, arising from awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Management Incentive Plan, or MIP. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the revaluation of ten of our vessels to their estimated net realizable value during the first half of 2016. Daily vessel operating expenses, or DVOE, decreased to $4,483 per vessel per day for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $4,997 per vessel per day for the same quarter of 2015 predominantly due to lower expenses related to maintenance, crewing and insurance as well as the timing of purchases of stores and spares. We believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a 12‑month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation. Based on estimates provided by our technical managers and management's views, our DVOE budget for 2016 is $4,820 per vessel per day on a weighted average basis for the entire year. Apostolos Zafolias, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "The proposed $400 million credit facility includes improved financial covenants such as the elimination of collateral maintenance tests through the first half of 2018, and a reduction of the minimum liquidity requirement. It also provides a more favorable repayment schedule with no significant amortization payments until 2019." Financial Review: Nine Months 2016 The Company recorded a net loss attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited of $192.7 million or $26.65 basic and diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This compares to a net loss attributable to Genco Shipping & Trading Limited of $145.4 million or $22.86 basic and diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Basic and diluted net loss per share for both periods has been adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split of Genco's common stock effected on July 7, 2016. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, includes non-cash vessel impairment charges of $69.3 million and $35.4 million, respectively. Revenues decreased to $91.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $119.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to lower spot market rates achieved by the majority of our vessels. TCE rates obtained by the Company decreased to $4,341 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,696 per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to lower rates achieved by the majority of the vessels in our fleet. Total operating expenses, excluding non-cash vessel impairment charges totaling $69.3 million relating to the revaluation of ten vessels to their estimated net realizable value, were $190.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This compares to total operating expenses, excluding a non-cash vessel impairment charge of $35.4 million relating to the sale of the Baltic Tiger and the Baltic Lion in April 2015, of $238.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Daily vessel operating expenses per vessel were $4,523 versus $4,841 in the comparative periods due to lower expenses related maintenance as well as crewing and insurance. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $45.9 million and $39.4 million, respectively.  Included in the net loss attributable to Genco during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are $72.0 million and $67.9 million of non-cash impairment charges, respectively. Also included in the net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively, of non-cash amortization of non-vested stock compensation due to the vesting of restricted shares and warrants primarily issued under the MIP. Additionally, the fluctuation in accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $13.7 million due to the timing of payments.  The above changes in operating activities were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in the fluctuation in prepaid expenses and other current assets.  Additionally, there was an $8.3 million decrease in deferred drydocking costs incurred because there were fewer vessels that completed drydocking during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period during 2015. Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $26.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The fluctuation is primarily due to a $45.7 million decrease in the purchase of vessels, including deposits.  The decrease is primarily due to the completion of the purchase of the Baltic Wasp on January 2, 2015 and the Baltic Scorpion on August 6, 2015.  Additionally, there was an increase of $3.2 million of proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale ("AFS") securities, as well as $1.9 million of proceeds from the sale of the Genco Marine which was scrapped during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These fluctuations were partially offset by a $19.6 million decrease in deposits of restricted cash, representing the amount of restricted cash that was held in an escrow account as of December 31, 2014 for the purchase of the Baltic Wasp, which was released to the shipyard upon the vessel delivery on January 2, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities was $40.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $26.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of the following: $15.2 million repayment of debt under the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $9.0 million repayment of debt under the $148 Million Credit Facility, $5.8 million repayment of debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $4.9 million repayment of debt under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under $44 Million Term Loan Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, $1.1 million repayment of debt under the $22 Million Term Loan Facility, and $0.1 million cash settlement paid to non-accredited 5.00% Convertible Senior Note holders. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of $131.5 million of proceeds from the $148 Million Credit Facility and $35.0 million of proceeds from 2015 Revolving Credit Facility partially offset by the following: $102.3 million repayment of debt under the 2010 Credit Facility, $16.9 million repayment of debt under the $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $5.8 million repayment of debt under the $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $4.9 million repayment of debt under the $148 Million Term Loan Facility, $2.1 million repayment of debt under the $44 Million Term Loan Facility, $1.1 million repayment of debt under the $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $1.4 million repayment of debt under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities, $0.7 million cash settlement paid to non-accredited 5.00% Convertible Senior Note holders, and $4.5 million payment of deferred financing costs. Capital Expenditures We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with vessel acquisitions. As of November 2, 2016, our fleet consists of 13 Capesize, eight Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, five Handymax and 16 Handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 5,053,000 dwt.   In addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings for our fleet. Two of our vessels were drydocked during the third quarter of 2016. We currently expect three of our vessels to be drydocked during the remainder of 2016. We estimate our capital expenditures related to drydocking for our fleet through 2017 to be:  Q4 20162017Estimated Costs (1)$3.2 million$15.6 millionEstimated Offhire Days (2)100385(1) Estimates are based on our budgeted cost of drydocking our vessels in China. Actual costs will vary based on various factors, including where the drydockings are actually performed. We expect to fund these costs with cash from operations. These costs do not include drydock expense items that are reflected in vessel operating expenses or potential costs associated with the installation of ballast water treatment systems. The estimated costs shown in the table above include $1.5 million and $4.8 million of estimated costs associated with vessels that could potentially be sold or scrapped as per the terms of the $400 Million Credit Facility during Q4 2016 and 2017, respectively. (2) Actual length will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors. The estimated offhire days shown in the table above include 60 days and 125 days associated with vessels that could potentially be sold or scrapped as per the terms of the $400 Million Credit Facility in Q4 2016 and 2017, respectively. One vessel began drydocking during June and completed drydocking during the third quarter. Two other vessels began drydocking during the third quarter, of which one vessel competed drydocking in September and the other completed drydocking during Q4 2016. The planned offhire days recorded for these vessels during the third quarter of 2016 amounted to 32.0 days. Capitalized costs associated with drydocking incurred during the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $0.9 million. Credit Facility Waivers/New Facility As previously announced, the Company entered into agreements for waivers of the collateral maintenance covenants under its $253 Million Term Loan Facility, its $100 Million Credit Facility, and its $148 Million Credit Facility, which were extended by the commitment letter for the Company's $400 Million Credit Facility, as amended.  The $400 Million Credit Facility is intended to address the Company's liquidity and covenant compliance issues and to refinance the Company's $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $44 Million Term Loan Facility, and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility (the "Prior Facilities"). Under the amended commitment letter, collateral maintenance waivers have been implemented or extended for the Prior Facilities through November 15, 2016.  Our credit facilities contain minimum cash covenants measured on a company-wide basis and on the basis of the number of vessels pledged by obligors under each such credit facility. The amended commitment letter also provides waivers of the Company's minimum cash covenants under the Prior Facilities that are applicable on a company-wide basis, so long as cash and cash equivalents of the Company are at least $25 million, and of the Company's maximum leverage ratio through November 15, 2016. Additionally, we have obtained collateral maintenance waivers under the 2014 Term Loan Facilities through November 15, 2016. Moreover, under the amended commitment letter, from August 31, 2016 through November 15, 2016, the amount of cash we would need to maintain under our minimum cash covenants applicable only to obligors in each facility to be refinanced under the Amended Commitment Letter would be reduced by up to $0.25 million per vessel, subject to an overall maximum cash withdrawal of $10.0 million to pay expenses and additional conditions. As also previously announced, the Company entered into a commitment letter for certain amendments to its $98 Million Facility. This commitment letter provides for certain covenant relief through November 15, 2016. For such period, compliance with the company-wide minimum cash covenant has been waived so long as cash and cash equivalents of the Company are at least $25 million; compliance with the maximum leverage ratio has been waived; and the ratio required to be maintained under the Company's collateral maintenance covenant will be 120% rather than 140%. The foregoing waivers, amendments, and the $400 Million Credit Facility are subject to conditions that the Company must fulfill, including the completion of an equity financing by November 15, 2016.    Financial Statement Presentation As previously announced, we completed our merger with Baltic Trading on July 17, 2015. Prior to the completion of the Genco and Baltic Trading merger, Genco consolidated Baltic Trading and the Baltic Trading common shares that Genco acquired in the merger were recognized as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements of Genco. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent losing control of the subsidiary are considered equity transactions (i.e. transactions with owners in their capacity as owners) with any difference between the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid attributed to the equity of the parent. Accordingly, upon completion of the merger, any difference between the fair value of the Genco common shares issued in exchange for Baltic Trading common shares was reflected as an adjustment to the equity in Genco. No gain or loss was reorganized in Genco's consolidated statement of comprehensive income upon completion of the transaction.

EBITDA is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance. EBITDA is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers. Our management uses EBITDA as a performance measure in consolidating internal financial statements and it is presented for review at our board meetings. For these reasons, we believe that EBITDA is a useful measure to present to our investors. EBITDA is not an item recognized by U.S. GAAP (i.e. non-GAAP measure) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other indicator of a company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows. The definition of EBITDA used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies. Pursuant to the amendments entered into on April 30, 2015 for our $100 Million Term Loan Facility and our $253 Million Term Loan Facility, the definition of Consolidated EBITDA used in the financial covenants has been eliminated. 2)  Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period. 3)  We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period. 4)  We define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels between time charters. Companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. 5)  We define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues. 6)  We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. 7)  We define TCE rates as our net voyage revenue (voyage revenues less voyage expenses (including voyage expenses to Parent)) divided by the number of our available days during the period, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. 8)  We define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance expenses relating to repairs and maintenance (excluding drydocking), the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period. Genco Shipping & Trading Limited's Fleet Genco Shipping & Trading Limited transports iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes. As of November 2, 2016, Genco Shipping & Trading Limited's fleet consists of 13 Capesize, eight Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, five Handymax and 16 Handysize vessels with an aggregate capacity of approximately 5,053,000 dwt. Our current fleet contains 16 groups of sister ships, which are vessels of virtually identical sizes and specifications. We believe that maintaining a fleet that includes sister ships reduces costs by creating economies of scale in the maintenance, supply and crewing of our vessels. As of November 2, 2016, the average age of our current fleet was 9.6 years.

Included among the factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this report are the following: (i) further declines or sustained weakness in demand in the drybulk shipping industry; (ii) continuation of weakness in drybulk shipping rates; (iii) changes in the supply of or demand for drybulk products, generally or in particular regions; (iv) changes in the supply of drybulk carriers including newbuilding of vessels or lower than anticipated scrapping of older vessels; (v) changes in rules and regulations applicable to the cargo industry, including, without limitation, legislation adopted by international organizations or by individual countries and actions taken by regulatory authorities; (vi) increases in costs and expenses including but not limited to: crew wages, insurance, provisions, lube, oil, bunkers, repairs, maintenance and general, administrative, and management fee expenses; (vii) whether our insurance arrangements are adequate; (viii) changes in general domestic and international political conditions; (ix) acts of war, terrorism, or piracy; (x) changes in the condition of the Company's vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards (which may affect, among other things, our anticipated drydocking or maintenance and repair costs) and unanticipated drydock expenditures; (xi) the Company's acquisition or disposition of vessels; (xii) the amount of offhire time needed to complete repairs on vessels and the timing and amount of any reimbursement by our insurance carriers for insurance claims, including offhire days; (xiii) the completion of definitive documentation with respect to charters; (xiv) charterers' compliance with the terms of their charters in the current market environment; (xv) the ability to realize the expected benefits of the our merger with Baltic Trading to the degree, in the amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; (xvi) the extent to which our operating results continue to be affected by weakness in market conditions and charter rates; (xvii) our ability to continue as a going concern, (xviii) our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operation, to obtain and maintain acceptable terms with our vendors, customers and service providers and to retain key executives, managers and employees; (xix) our ability to implement measures to resolve our liquidity and covenant compliance issues; (xx) our ability to fulfill conditions under the commitment letters for our credit facilities, including without limitation completion of definitive documentation and an equity financing; and other factors listed from time to time in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, without limitation, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and its subsequent reports on Form 8-K. Our ability to pay dividends in any period will depend upon various factors, including the limitations under any credit agreements to which we may be a party, applicable provisions of Marshall Islands law and the final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance. The timing and amount of dividends, if any, could also be affected by factors affecting cash flows, results of operations, required capital expenditures, or reserves.  As a result, the amount of dividends actually paid may vary.  We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.John C.
