Forward-looking statements, some of which are based on various assumptions and events that are beyond our control, may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward looking terminology, such as “may,” “capable,” “will,” “intends,” “believe,” “expect,” “likely,” “potentially”  ”appear,” “should,” “could,” “seem to,” “anticipate,” “expectations,” “plan,” “ensure,” or similar terms or variations on those terms or the negative of those terms. The forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations. Actual results may differ materially as a result of several factors, including, but not limited to the following:  failure to achieve the benefits expected from the acquisition of the CCM operations, including an increase in origination volume generally, increase in each of our origination channels and ability to successfully use the marketing platform to expand volumes of our other loan products; successful development, marketing, sale and financing of new and existing financial products, including expansion of non-Qualified Mortgage originations and conventional and government loan programs; ability to successfully diversify our mortgage products; volatility in the mortgage industry; unexpected interest rate fluctuations and margin compression; our ability to manage personnel expenses in relation to mortgage production levels; our ability to successfully use warehousing capacity; increased competition in the mortgage lending industry by larger or more efficient companies; issues and system risks related to our technology; ability to successfully create cost and product efficiencies through new technology; more than expected increases in default rates or loss severities and mortgage related losses; ability to obtain additional financing through lending and repurchase facilities, debt or equity funding, strategic relationships or otherwise;  the terms of any financing, whether debt or equity, that we do obtain and our expected use of proceeds from any financing; increase in loan repurchase requests and ability to adequately settle repurchase obligations; failure to create brand awareness; the outcome, including any settlements, of litigation or regulatory actions pending against us or other legal contingencies; and our compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations and other general market and economic conditions.  For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see the annual and quarterly reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This document speaks only as of its date and we do not undertake, and specifically disclaim any obligation, to release publicly the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.Read MoreFor additional information, questions or comments, please call Justin Moisio, VP Business Development & Investor Relations at (949) 475-3988 or email Justin.Moisio@ImpacMail.com.

Akin Thomas
CEO
Specialist Sectors
Akin’s role has evolved into the strategic development of AKD as the company has continued to grow and expand.
Much of his time is spent talking with clients to discuss innovation and trends to ensure AKD’s courses not only meet their current requirements, but are positioned to future-proof their learning and development needs, whether they are in the UK, Europe or North America.
Background
Akin’s background spans roles in both the public and private sector, where Complaints Management became a specialism (partly through his role as a Complaints Manager for dealing with Adult and Children Social Care). Over the years his role has encompassed complaints handling, customer experience, leadership and management development.
He developed new models for complaints handling and investigation which were “people focused”. These provided a fresh and successful approach to handling highly sensitive and complex customer complaints, as well as more general complaints.
Akin is hugely enthusiastic about empowering staff to deliver a better experience and become the very best they can be – the reason why he often talks about stimulating brilliance.
Coupled with his belief that “People Learn More When They’re Having Fun”, Akin developed a new concept to make learning fun, interactive and more engaging. “Complaints Made Easy” subsequently became AKD’s first Interactive Training Tool and it remains one of the most popular learning tools used in social care and healthcare.
He became the founder and CEO of AKD Solutions in 2008, with the aspiration to create a learning and development organisation that would leave a real imprint on learners; encouraging and compelling them to go back to their workplace to “become and do better”.
What Akin Adds To Team AKD
Akin’s experience and innovative approach to learning and development drives the way AKD Solutions deal with every project. His energy, creativity and vision are responsible for the success of the business and the growth of the team of Associates who form TEAM AKD.
It has also brought its own rewards…as AKD has grown into an international learning and development provider with clients in 15 countries.
