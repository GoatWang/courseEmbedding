Addus HomeCare, Inc.




Company Overview

Addus HomeCare is one of the nation's largest providers of personal home care and support services. We are a client-focused, innovative and forward-thinking company, and we are always looking for top talent. Great opportunities...dynamic company!


Addus History


Addus was founded in 1979 as a home cleaning service focusing on serving residents in high rises in downtown Chicago. The company expanded when a small contract was acquired with the city of Chicago to provide chore services to the city's at-risk elderly population. The chore services program later expanded into the Community Care Program through the Illinois Department on Aging, and the company significantly increased its client base in Illinois under the new name, National Home Care Services.
The company's growth continued through the acquisition of additional home care contracts in other states, the opening of new branch offices, and the diversification into new service lines, including skilled home health services and adult day services. In 1996, the company changed its name to Addus HomeCare. Through a national name change nomination contest, an employee in California, who studied ancient deities as a hobby, suggested the name Addus based on the ancient Celtic deity who brought health and wellness to his people.
Addus has intensified its focus on becoming a sales and service driven organization, expanding its service integration model and establishing the company brand. Addus currently holds approximately 300 home care contracts throughout the country. The company provides health care services to over 33,000 consumers weekly from over 111 
				branches located in 24 states.
Addus has also continued to develop an employee-centered culture based on a commitment to practicing its established beliefs and values and the recognition that Addus employees are its greatest asset.


Our Employees are our Greatest Asset

At Addus, we recognize that to be a great home care company, we must have great employees. Engaged, energized, passionate employees who take ownership for the care and service they deliver and who are driven to do their best each day for their clients. That's what the home care business is all about.
All companies promote their strengths, but we promote our people because we believe they are the basis for our success and what sets us apart from our competition.
We are fortunate that our employees come to us with an innate passion for serving others. They love what they do and are personally fulfilled by their work and the impact they have on the clients, families and communities they serve.
Building a Multi-Language Community
One of the things Addus is most proud of and thankful 
				for is our amazing community of home care and support 
				professionals. This community believes outstanding outcomes 
				begin with good communication. Dedicated to this ideal, Addus 
				employees represent a diverse group with a multitude of 
				languages skills. Currently represented languages 
				include American Sign, Bosnian, Cambodian, Cantonese, English, 
				Farsi, French, Greek, Hindi, Japanese, Navajo, Nigerian, Polish, 
				Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Tagalog, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and 
				Yugoslav.
