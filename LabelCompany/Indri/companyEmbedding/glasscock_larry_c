Methodology:
Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year.
Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score.
Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and
six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least
efficient is 189.

Footnotes:
Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based
on Mar. 31, 2005 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on
combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers
the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available
stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested
in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S&P500.
NA: Not available or not applicable. NM: Not meaningful. 1Annualized.
2Four-year total. 3Three-year total. 4Less than 0.01%. 5Prior-year data.
6New chief executive; compensation may be for another executive office.
7Less than $100,000. 8Received options or restricted stock in lieu of
portion of salary. 9Received options or restricted stock in lieu of

INDIANAPOLIS, IN – May 10, 2004 -- Brittany Davis of Saco, Maine, will receive a $20,000 scholarship to attend Elon University as one of the 12 scholarship recipients from the Larry C. and Lee Ann Glasscock Scholarship Fund, a fund at the Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF). The Fund awards scholarships for dependents of Anthem employees nationwide who will be first generation college graduates. A total of $205,000 in scholarship funds will be awarded in 2004. Larry C. Glasscock, chairman, president and CEO of Anthem, Inc., and his wife, Lee, established the fund with a donation of $1 million in December 2003. 
“Through our partnership with CICF, 12 first generation college students will be better able to realize their dream of graduating from college and have the opportunities that a college education can offer,” said Mr. Glasscock, also a first-generation college graduate. “The scholarship fund has allowed us to focus on what’s most important to our family: sharing the opportunities a college education can bring to those who might not otherwise have been able to attend.” 
Scholarship recipients were chosen from more than 60 applicants in nine states. The other 11 recipients and their respective colleges include: 
 Albert Baldwin of Indianapolis, Indiana.  Albert plans to attend Purdue University.
 Ashley Barbour of Concord, New Hampshire. Ashley plans to attend the University of New Hampshire.
 Melissa Busher of Branford, Connecticut. Melissa plans to attend Central Connecticut State University.
 David DiNuoscio of Hamilton, Ohio.  David currently attends University of Notre Dame.
 Meghan Dunn of Louisville, Kentucky.  Meghan plans to attend University of Louisville.
 Lanetta Farr of Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Lanetta plans to attend North Carolina A&T.
 Brian Figg of Mt. Washington, Kentucky.  Brian plans to attend University of Louisville.
 Christopher Harnain of Hopewell, Virginia.  Christopher currently attends University of Virginia.
 Kristin Radonski of Boardman, Ohio.  Kristin currently attends Youngstown State.

Scholarship recipients just beginning college will receive $5,000 per year for four years, if the student continues to be enrolled and demonstrates academic progress. Current college students will receive $5,000 per year to finish their college education. Recipients are required to submit year-end reports and transcripts for CICF scholarship staff review. 
The Larry C. and Lee Ann Glasscock Scholarship Fund is the second largest scholarship fund ever established with CICF out of its more than 100 existing scholarship funds. 
“It is an honor to work with the Glasscocks to realize their philanthropic goals and ensure that this gift will make an enduring impact on Anthem’s next generation in central Indiana and around the U.S.," said Brian Payne, president of Central Indiana Community Foundation. 
During the 2002-2003 academic year, CICF awarded $1.78 million in more than 600 scholarships to students in central Indiana. CICF manages more than 100 scholarship funds.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
