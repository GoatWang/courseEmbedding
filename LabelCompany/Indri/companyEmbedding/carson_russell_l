Russell L. Carson












Co-Founding Partner and General Partner Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe
Since 1978 Russell Carson has been a General Partner of Welsh,  Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS), one of the country's largest  private investment firms, which he co-founded. Over the past 24 years,  WCAS has raised thirteen institutionally funded limited partnerships  with total capital in excess of $12 billion and has invested in more  than 250 companies.
The firm has evolved into the leading  specialist in the buyout of privately owned companies in the information  services and healthcare industries. Unlike many buyout firms, WCAS  emphasizes the growth of acquired businesses and ultimately seeks its  financial returns through access to the public stock market. Mr. Carson  has focused on WCAS's healthcare investment activities and is currently a  director of three portfolio companies.
From 1967 to 1978 he was  employed by the Citicorp Venture Capital subsidiary of Citicorp and  served as its Chairman and CEO from 1974 to 1978.
Active in  community affairs, Mr. Carson is a Trustee of Dartmouth College, Vice  Chairman of The Rockefeller University Board of Trustees, Chairman of  the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School, a Trustee of the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Director of the Partnership for New York  City, a co-chairman of the New York City Investment Fund and Chairman of  the Inner-City Scholarship Endowment Fund.
Russell Carson  attended public high school in Toledo, Ohio prior to receiving a BA  degree in economics from Dartmouth College in 1964 and an MBA from  Columbia Business School in 1967. He resides in New York City with his  wife Judy and their two children
