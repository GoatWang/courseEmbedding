pursuant to a resale registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, (ii) such shares have been sold under the safe-harbor
provision of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, or (iii) such shares
have been otherwise transferred and the Issuer has issued new stock
certificates representing such shares without a legend restricting further
transfer.� Under the Edwards
Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer agreed to file a registration
statement covering the shares of Common Stock that Mr. Edwards owned as of July
1, 2002, as well as those shares he may acquire from time to time pursuant to
the exercise of the stock options.�
Pursuant to the terms of the Edwards Registration Agreement, such
registration statement shall remain effective until the later of (i) the date
which is 36 months following the date which the registration statement becomes
effective and (ii) the date which is three months after such time on which Mr. Edwards
is no longer an affiliate of the Issuer.�
In addition, if the Issuer proposes to register any of its securities
for its own account or the account of its security holders under the Securities
Act of 1933, other than on a registration statement concerning a business
combination, an exchange of securities or any employee benefits plan, Mr.
Edwards is entitled to request the inclusion of his registerable securities in
such registration.� The Issuer has
agreed to bear all of the expenses of these registrations, except any
underwriters� commissions, discounts and fees, and the fees and expenses of any
legal counsel to Mr. Edwards.

I was blessed to meet Mr. Edwards at a Camp Hill Pancake Breakfast held at CHUM.  He invited me in to his heart and shared stories, soon to find out we had a lot of family history.  From the short time I had known Mr. Edwards, it was evident that he lived life with extreme integrity and was compassionate to all lives he was in the presence of.  God Bless Mr. Edwards and the FamilyLove, Jaime Toigo

God bless this loving, caring man. He was so easy to talk to, making our conversations enjoyable during the holidays when we'd catch up with him. It is an honor to have known him and his wonderful family. Love, prayers, and healing thoughts to all whose lives he touched.

Don and Mary Jane created quite possibly the happiest household that I have ever visited. Having met them all through CHPC in 1980, I can't think of a time when their house was anything but upbeat, even after their house fire in 1981. Don was a good man and a caring man. When he asked how you were doing he waited for an answer, and it usually started a conversation. One time in 1981 I barged in on their family

Don and Mary Jane created quite possibly the happiest household that I have ever visited.  Having met them all through CHPC in 1980, I can't think of a time when their house was anything but upbeat, even after their house fire in 1981.  Don was a good man and a caring man.  When he asked how you were doing he waited for an answer, and it usually started a conversation. One time in 1981 I barged in on their family dinner and he immediately got a seat for me, and asked about a family day-trip we had just taken. He made it the topic of the dinner table.  He was such a good and nice man, and together they raised an incredible family.Well done Mr. Edwards."For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith" (Acts 11:24 King James Version)
