                                Report abuseTranscript of Engel v. VitaleEngel v. VitaleBy: Megan Matula, Carly SullivanMain Arguments of both sidesEngel (the parents): Believed that the separation of church and state requires that government stay out of the business of prescribing religious activities of any kind, therefore the Regents' prayer violated the 1st Amendment and should then on organized prayer should be prohibited from schools. Regents of the State of New York: Believed they  did not establish a religion by providing a prayer for those who chose to participate to say it , and New York acted  constitutionally by providing an optional prayer. They also thought that it would violate state occurrences if   the Supreme Court to prohibit Regents from composing prayer and encourage its recitationSupreme Court RulingThe Court found the New York Regents' prayer to be unconstitutional in a 8-1 majority opinion The ruling was based upon the "wall of separation" between church and state Chief Justice Black stated: “It is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers…” WhoSteven Engel- a concerned parentV.William Vitale- school board presidentWhatNew York state’s Board of Regents wrote a voluntary, nondenominational prayer that could be recited by students at the beginning of each school day. During 1958–59 a group of parents which included Steven Engel objected to the prayer, which read, “Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our country,” they then sued the school board president, William VitaleWhere/WhenThis occurred in Hyde Park, New York in 1958 and went through 1959Works Cited Oral arguments for the case did not start until April 3, 1962The ruling was released on June 25How/WhyOpinion of the CourtThis case was brought to the Supreme Court because,the prayer which people argued was constitutional on the basis that it was voluntary and promoted the free exercise of religion (also protected in the First Amendment), was upheld by New York’s courts, prompting the petitioners to file a successful appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Engel was supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, and briefs were filed on their behalf by the American Ethical Union and the American Jewish Committee, while the governments of some 20 states called on the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the prayer. The Supreme Court's opinion was that even though the prayer was nondenominational, meaning it did not advocate to a certain religion, it still is unconstitutional.  Saying the prayer alone means that  the state of New York officially approved of this religious occurrence.   Recited the establishment clause to support their opinion.  means the government can not prohibit or advocate any religious doings. Landmark CaseEngel v Vitale was first of many cases the Supreme court used the establishment clause to eliminate any sort of religious activities relating to the public or government Related to the Supreme Court using a broader view of using the establishment clause-could relate to issues such as providing federal funds to private religious affiliated schoolsSet a precedent for future cases regarding organized prayer in government building or public placeJudicial TerminologyAfter state court ruling petitioner's parents requested a Writ of Certiorari about  the order from the lower state courts which allowed respondent's authority to use prayer in the public schools unless a student's parents refused permission.  Supreme court justices accepted the Writ; and put the case on the docket for a Supreme Court hearing.  Prior to the preceding of the case in Supreme court there was a conference discussing any prior facts of the case. Many Amicus Curiae briefs were submitted by religious groups on behalf of Engel and many were sent in by Attorey Generals of states on behalf of Vitale in order to sway justices opinions in support or opposition of Engel. The opinion of the court was a 8-1 ruling against Engel stating that prayer preceding the school day violates the first amendment. In contrast to the majority opinion, the minority opinion, or otherwise known as the dissenting opinion, states that prayer before school does not clearly "establish" religion there for it does not clearly violate the first amendment.
