Not likely. I find it so frustrating when I read articles like this one.  Our industry is rich with extremely talented people who love LOVE and believe in love and equality!

Salutations!​How to Address a Wedding Invitation to a Gay or Lesbian Married Coupleby Jessie Reid






​Photo by Maison Pestea Photography
​Once you understand the etiquette in addressing an envelope to a married (hetero) couple, addressing a wedding to a married same-sex couple will make some sense. Unfortunately, the box your engagement ring came in did not come with a manual of all the rules that must be followed when wedding planning. Luckily enough for you, the internet, your friends (or mother - bless her heart) and LGBTWeddings.com are here to save you from the embarassment of stumbling through this process blind. Forget the grace that should come with embarking on such an endeavor for the first time - LGBTWeddings.com exists to give you all the answers to questions you didn’t even know you had!Let’s start with getting the invites out. There are resources upon resources for proper wording on invitations. But a situation less covered is how to address a married same-sex couple. Likely, if you’re reading this, you’ll want this information for when you and your sweetheart order your first sheets of return address labels. You can think about how you want to be addressed as a married couple - and spare your friends the guessing!The most traditional way to address an envelope to a married couple is:Mr. and Mrs. John SmithFor a couple with different last names, the proper way of addressing the envelope would be:Mr. John Smith and Mrs. Jane BrownFor same-sex couples, we will follow the same format, but must first determine if the couple has the same last name. If so, they would be addressed as follows:Mr. and Mr. John and Steve Smithor Mrs. and Mrs. Jane and Sarah BrownIf the same-sex couple is married with different last names, the names should be written in alphabetical order. Mr. John Smith and Mr. Steve Hoffor Mrs. Jane Brown and Mrs. Sarah Gonzalez*BONUS:If the same-sex couple is un-married, the names should be on two separate lines:Mr. John Smith Mr. Steve HofforMrs. Jane Brown Mrs. Sarah Gonzalez

by Jessie ReidThis is one of the most wonderful times to be in love in the LGBT community as citizens of the United States. Thanks to the Supreme Court of the United States declaring that marriage is not confined to man and woman, but to people uniting as one, more people than ever before are taking their relationships to the next level. If you and your significant other are one of the many couples ready to tie the knot, you may have been debating about whether to have a traditional wedding or a destination wedding.

Gorgeous Crystal Infused Woodland WeddingA Styled Shoot by Katie Keighin Photography
​by Alyssa Bates  |  Photos by Katie Keighin Photography





This gorgeous crystal infused, woodland themed, same-sex styled wedding shoot was the product of trends the photographer, Katie, had been seeing. The shoot was done at Inspiration Point, Colorado.











 
Our ProvidersCake | BakeryThe Paper CraneCinema & Video Innovative Motion Design & Decor Patina Preferred:A Vintage Rental Boutique FloralDetails DeliveredHairstylist I Do SalonPhotographerKatie Keighin Photography ​VenueInspiration Point, Colorado
 



Katie paired up with a team of vendors who were able to make her vision a reality. She made the decision to use a same-sex couple because it was something her team of vendors had wanted to emphasize on behalf of their companies since it is now becoming more nationally recognized.

LGBT Weddings in 2016
A Review of CMI Research One Year After the Landmark Rulings by the United States Supreme Court
Summary
Community Marketing & Insights (CMI), in partnership with WeddingWire, Inc., GayWeddings and the Gay Wedding Institute, conducted an LGBT Wedding survey about couples’ choices, preferences, and concerns about weddings. Research participants were recruited from the databases of all partner organizations and over 1,400 people completed the survey.
The 2016 LGBT market research has revealed significant differences between same-sex and opposite-sex couples’ purchases and attitudes towards wedding ceremonies. While opposite-sex couples typically get engaged and married in their early 20s to early 30s, in LGBT wedding, the age spread is much wider, ranging from early 20s to early 50s. In addition, same-sex couples traditionally have been together longer than opposite-sex couples before their marriage. The reason for this is that marriage equality wasn’t available to these couples in the past. Since the 2015 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage across the entire United States, these numbers are likely to change in the future.
Ceremonies & Receptions
Couples also behave differently when it comes to LGBT wedding ceremonies and receptions. They have smaller ceremonies with fewer guests than opposite-sex couples, and as a result they spend less on their weddings (however, their spend per person is actually slightly higher).

LGBT wedding have an average of 94 guests compared to 150 guests for opposite-sex weddings.
Same-sex couples spend slightly more per guest when compared to opposite-sex couples, $117 per guest vs. $100 per guest. However, this may also be a function of scale as LGBT weddings tend to be smaller, and perhaps this drives up the cost per guest. Regardless, the difference is not substantive. For a wedding professional, only the budget of the couple before you really matters.
The location of ceremonies and receptions includes a wide range of venues for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. However, since LGBT wedding tend to be smaller,they can consider more options like restaurants and private residences, while larger weddings often use hotels and function spaces.

Use of Vendors
When looking for wedding vendors, same-sex couples prefer those who are inclusive and support same-sex weddings. Same-sex couples feel very strongly that businesses should not discriminate, and they support brands that use same-sex couples and marriage equality in their advertising.

87% of LGBT couples find it important that a vendor provides services to all types of couples
57% of same-sex couples reported using at least one type of LGBT-specific wedding resource
86% percent of same-sex couples react very positively to advertising that includes images of same-sex couples

Some same-sex couples did report discrimination in their wedding planning process. Discrimination can come in the form of denial of service, prejudice in ‘bridal bias’ language, and hetero-normative assumptions. An additional concern is vendor forms and marketing materials that do not acknowledge LGBT weddings.

12% of engaged same-sex couples have experienced discrimination in the planning process
47% percent of same-sex couples fear being rejected by a vendor based on sexual orientation

Support of Families
Same-sex couples are far more likely than opposite sex couples to pay for the marriage themselves, with no support from parents.  75% of couples reported paying for LGBTwedding themselves. There are multiple reasons: First, same-sex couples are, on average, older and may not need or want support from parents; some same sex-weddings are quite small with no support needed; and gender roles of the bride’s family offering significant support may be confusing for many families of same-sex couples. As families become more comfortable with same-sex marriage, and the average age of same-sex couple weddings lowers, more family support is anticipated in the future.
Honeymoons 
Honeymoon destinations are quite dispersed among LGBT couples, but beach destinations are preferred. Hawaii had the most same-sex honeymoons reported at 8%, followed by Florida 7% and Mexico 5%.
Conclusion
LGBT weddings are a new business opportunity for United States companies that provide products and services to weddings. However, many same-sex couples are concerned about discrimination and truly being welcomed by vendors. Businesses that provide genuinely inclusiveservices are likely to attract more business from the LGBT community.

Choosing the right engagement ring or wedding set may have been a challenge, but choosing the perfect men’s wedding band doesn’t have to be. With the large selection of wedding bands for men by Simon G., we have something to suit every style.
Because you are going to be wearing this ring for the rest of your life, it must be something that you love and feel comfortable wearing. The first decision you need to make is if you prefer white gold, yellow gold, rose gold, or platinum. While many couples choose to match each other in metal style and color, it is not a requirement that you both have similar rings. Some of our wedding bands for men feature two-toned options, giving you the best of both worlds. Marriage is all about compromise, so combining both of your favorite metal colors into one ring is the perfect start to finding common ground as you say ‘I do’.
After you choose your precious metal preference, you need to decide if you want diamonds, a sleek look, or a more contemporary style. Different geometric designs can give your ring a distinct and unique look while remaining traditional. A hammered look is a very popular style and when you combine it with a textured outer rim, you truly have a sensational look that is still very stylish.
Another popular style is the puzzle-piece look, where different pieces of metal are positioned to look like they fit together like jigsaw pieces. The LP2477 is a great example of this style, featuring two-toned metal and diamonds on the center links.
You can find all of our wedding bands at select high-end retailers. Use the locate a store feature to find a store near you, and start your happily ever after in style.

These bridal duos offer several advantages over proposal and wedding bands that are normally bought separately. Wedding sets have a very distinctive look and could be the perfect way to express your love.
Uniformity is another big advantage to these pairs. Sometimes, try as you might, it can be hard to achieve a uniform look when choosing separate bands. Duos are designed to incorporate both bands into one stunning piece of jewelry. This uniformity is something many brides desire.


A pair of bands is also one of the most classic looks for the classic bride. Engagement ring sets are unique all on their own and, instead of looking as though you are wearing two or three different items, the pair looks like one incredible piece. Purchasing a wedding pair is also convenient. You only have to make one purchase and not go on the hunt for a matching band. While it is certainly a big decision, we are confident that our wide range of jewels will make it a much easier process. We have designs to suit many tasteful styles and fashions for your special day.


In addition, this is truly a choice of style coupled with comfort. It can take time for a person to get used to wearing a band on her finger. If choosing two separate pieces, one of the bands could shift and move and the other could turn, making it uncomfortable to wear jewelry. A pair is worn as just one item which is a lot more comfortable. Some pairs will even feature two separate wedding bands that hug the main band on either side. This style can be more difficult to do if all three pieces were to stand on their own.

THERE’S NOTHING LIKE CATERING MENLO PARK PARTIES AND EVENTS.
We’ve noticed a lot of very well read people when we’re catering Menlo Park affairs. Maybe that’s because of the cool bookstores in town. Between Kepler’s and Feldman’s, you could become a pretty sophisticated party-goer after a while. If you’re interested in more good reading, take a look at our catering menu! It’s designed to make your catering experience effortless. 
“SIMPLICITY AND SUPERB SERVICE.” THAT’S OUR MOTTO.
Planning an event with us is as easy as browsing the cookbook section of your favorite bookshop, except that you get to request whatever dishes catch your eye! Everything we offer is presented with photos and prices so you can see exactly what you’re getting and how it squares with your budget. Our goal is make your planning simple and your event unforgettable.
WHATEVER YOU NEED, COUNT ON US TO GET IT FOR YOU.
Whether we’re catering Menlo Park banquets or family milestones, we’re all about providing everything you need. The food is always fabulous and we can help you with all the service staff, bartenders and rentals you need. We don’t do onsite chefs, alcohol or tents, but we have carefully selected partner companies we work with to get all of those things for you.
We’ll cater affairs for guest lists of 20 to 2,000. But we’re also the people to call when you need some delicious light catering for your office staff when they’re working through lunch. Or when you need a nice conference-room business lunch for a client. As a business serving Menlo Park, the local business community is important to us. Your success is our success.
SO? LET’S START PLANNING!
If you don’t have time to meet at our place, we’ll come to your home or office. We’ve been catering Menlo Park long enough to know it very well.  If you’d rather meet at another favorite spot in town where you like to take meetings, that’s fine too. Just tell us when and where and we’ll be there.

CATERING REDWOOD CITY PARTIES & EVENTS.
It’s no secret that Redwood City knows how to party. Downtown should be a must-see for anybody visiting the Bay Area. Go where the locals go. Right? But even a party town needs a little help throwing a party, once in a while. So, when it’s time for your next party or event, come to us. We’ve got catering Redwood City events down to a science.
IN FACT, WE’VE GOT CATERING DOWN TO A SCIENCE.
Our way of doing catering is unlike any other. Rather than talk a great game about food that we might prepare for you, we show you a menu of exactly what we offer, with prices on full display. It makes putting together a great meal as simple as the simplest equation! Hey, with all of the science and technology types in this area, we just can’t help using a little Silicon Valley lingo!
COUNT ON US FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED.
Whether we’re catering Redwood City homes, businesses or event venues, we’re all about providing everything you need—from a tasty tray of conference room sandwiches to an event guest list in the thousands. The food is always fabulous and we can also help you with all the service staff, bartenders and rentals you need. We also have carefully selected partner companies we work with when you need alcohol, tents or onsite chefs.
WE’RE HERE FOR YOU…OR WHEREVER ELSE YOU NEED US.
No time to stop by and talk about your catering needs? Not a problem. After catering Redwood City events for as long as we have, we know the area and we’re always up for a visit. We’ll be happy to bring the planning process to you. Let’s meet and pick a nice spot outside for a chat. When your climate is the “best by government test,” why hang out inside? Just let us know where and when and we’ll be there.

CATERING REDWOOD CITY PARTIES & EVENTS.
It’s no secret that Redwood City knows how to party. Downtown should be a must-see for anybody visiting the Bay Area. Go where the locals go. Right? But even a party town needs a little help throwing a party, once in a while. So, when it’s time for your next party or event, come to us. We’ve got catering Redwood City events down to a science.
IN FACT, WE’VE GOT CATERING DOWN TO A SCIENCE.
Our way of doing catering is unlike any other. Rather than talk a great game about food that we might prepare for you, we show you a menu of exactly what we offer, with prices on full display. It makes putting together a great meal as simple as the simplest equation! Hey, with all of the science and technology types in this area, we just can’t help using a little Silicon Valley lingo!
COUNT ON US FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED.
Whether we’re catering Redwood City homes, businesses or event venues, we’re all about providing everything you need—from a tasty tray of conference room sandwiches to an event guest list in the thousands. The food is always fabulous and we can also help you with all the service staff, bartenders and rentals you need. We also have carefully selected partner companies we work with when you need alcohol, tents or onsite chefs.
WE’RE HERE FOR YOU…OR WHEREVER ELSE YOU NEED US.
No time to stop by and talk about your catering needs? Not a problem. After catering Redwood City events for as long as we have, we know the area and we’re always up for a visit. We’ll be happy to bring the planning process to you. Let’s meet and pick a nice spot outside for a chat. When your climate is the “best by government test,” why hang out inside? Just let us know where and when and we’ll be there.

THERE’S NOTHING LIKE CATERING MENLO PARK PARTIES AND EVENTS.
We’ve noticed a lot of very well read people when we’re catering Menlo Park affairs. Maybe that’s because of the cool bookstores in town. Between Kepler’s and Feldman’s, you could become a pretty sophisticated party-goer after a while. If you’re interested in more good reading, take a look at our catering menu! It’s designed to make your catering experience effortless. 
“SIMPLICITY AND SUPERB SERVICE.” THAT’S OUR MOTTO.
Planning an event with us is as easy as browsing the cookbook section of your favorite bookshop, except that you get to request whatever dishes catch your eye! Everything we offer is presented with photos and prices so you can see exactly what you’re getting and how it squares with your budget. Our goal is make your planning simple and your event unforgettable.
WHATEVER YOU NEED, COUNT ON US TO GET IT FOR YOU.
Whether we’re catering Menlo Park banquets or family milestones, we’re all about providing everything you need. The food is always fabulous and we can help you with all the service staff, bartenders and rentals you need. We don’t do onsite chefs, alcohol or tents, but we have carefully selected partner companies we work with to get all of those things for you.
We’ll cater affairs for guest lists of 20 to 2,000. But we’re also the people to call when you need some delicious light catering for your office staff when they’re working through lunch. Or when you need a nice conference-room business lunch for a client. As a business serving Menlo Park, the local business community is important to us. Your success is our success.
SO? LET’S START PLANNING!
If you don’t have time to meet at our place, we’ll come to your home or office. We’ve been catering Menlo Park long enough to know it very well.  If you’d rather meet at another favorite spot in town where you like to take meetings, that’s fine too. Just tell us when and where and we’ll be there.

Picture Perfect: 6 Great Photo Spots in Houston
With the creation of selfie sticks, it's now easier than ever to take pictures everywhere you go. However, certain places add that extra blast of color and setting that turn a simple portrait into a picture to remember. Houston has no shortage of photo opportunities, and it's worth noting these six standout locations.







1. The "We Love Houston" Sign
This sign declares its love for the city while standing an impressive 28-feet tall. It's a three-dimensional sculpture created by Houston artist David Adickes. Adickes' choice to use the word "We" instead of other cities' choice of "I" embodies the Houston's inclusive mindset. Each letter is a rainbow color that captures the vibrancy and diversity of the city. The iconic image is emblazoned on Houston products, as well as featured in commercials and photographs. The sculpture can be found at 1816 Thompson St. on property owned by the artist. It was a gift to the city but there is no designated parking. Be careful walking to the sign as weather conditions can leave the ground surrounding it bumpy.










2. Market Square Park
Market Square Park offers a cornucopia of picturesque nooks. The small, well-designed park has fountains, mosaics and sculptures. Across the street from the park on the side of Treebeards restaurant sits one of Houston's most colorful and most frequently photographed murals. The work by artist GONZO247 is a rainbow explosion of spray paint glory proclaiming, "Houston is Inspired." The piece is featured on the screen at the Bush International Airport welcoming visitors.










3. JPMorgan Chase Tower Sky Lobby
If you want to take a picture from inside but still feature a uniquely Houston flavor, visit the JPMorgan Chase Tower at 600 Travis St. and take the elevator up to the Sky Lobby. The building is open to the public during traditional office hours, and the 60th floor has floor-to-ceiling windows offering one of the best views of the city. The observation deck provides an outlook on three sides, and unlike observation decks in other cities, the view at JPMorgan Chase is completely free!










4. Hermann Park
Hermann Park is one of Houston's most beloved stretches of land. With the zoo on one side and the Museum of Natural Science on the other, it contains miles of running trails, picnic tables, ponds and a reflection pool. Top-notch sculptures are sprinkled throughout the park and rotate regularly. You may find a giant spider sculpture or a hut made of twisted wood. If you're feeling really jovial, take a ride on the mini-train that drives around the park to get an action shot.










5. Rice University
Few streets are as picturesque as the entrance to Rice University. Canopied by several varieties of old oak trees, Rice has earned the distinction of "Tree Campus USA" by the Arbor Day Foundation. Add an assemblage of buildings with unique and diverse architecture to the forestlike setting and the Rice campus encompasses myriad possibilities for memorable photos.










6. The Biscuit Paint Wall
Affectionately known as The Biscuit Paint Wall, the dripped paint mural on the side of Biscuit Paint at 1435 Westheimer is the perfect backdrop for a bright and bold portrait. Painted by Mr. D (Eyeful Art), the mural has become a regular stopping point for tourists and locals. The store is determined to maintain the mural for as long as it is being enjoyed



Whether you opt for a mural, nature or indoor backdrop, you'll find ample opportunity to take awesome photos all around Houston.
