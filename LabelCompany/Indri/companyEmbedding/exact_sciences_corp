The long-vacant former headquarters of Spectrum Brands, seen from the Beltline between Whitney Way and Gammon Road, is one of two finalists as the site for a second processing lab for Exact Sciences, developer of the Cologuard DNA-stool test for colorectal cancer.


JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL





















































For what’s believed to be the first time in nearly four years, there is a solid contender that could turn the former Spectrum Brands property into a major employment site again.Exact Sciences Corp. is considering the location at 601 Rayovac Drive to house its second processing lab and customer service offices, CEO and President Kevin Conroy confirmed Friday.“It’s one of two sites we’re evaluating. Nothing is final,” Conroy said. He said the other location is “suburban.”
A Fitchburg city official confirmed Friday that a site in that community also is a finalist, but declined to elaborate.Publicly traded Exact Sciences is developing tests to screen for cancer. Its first product, Cologuard, a DNA-based stool test for colorectal cancer, has been on the market since August 2014 and the company expects to process 470,000 tests this year.Exact already fills two buildings and part of a third at University Research Park. It is expanding its Cologuard processing lab in the town of Madison and recently completed a secondary stock sale to pay for that project and to add a second processing lab for future needs.The stock sale netted the company $253.4 million, with the sale of 450,000 shares beyond the initial 7 million-share sale, the company said, in papers filed Wednesday with federal regulators.An application submitted to the Madison Urban Design Commission on June 28 does not name the company considering the Spectrum Brands site. But it calls for building a clinical lab and warehouse with a total of 115,000 square feet of space on what’s now a parking lot just south of the existing buildings.The four-story, 157,000 square-foot office building that housed Spectrum Brands’ headquarters would remain. The adjacent research and development building, 630 Forward Drive, would eventually be torn down and replaced by a parking lot; new additions could connect the office building with the new labs in a second construction phase.The location “provides the ability for the facility to double in size as the company is experiencing fast growth,” says the letter of intent submitted by the Potter Lawson architectural firm.No specific timetable or price is listed for the project.
Madison city officials are happy to see a proposal that could bring several hundred jobs to the West Side neighborhood, said Natalie Erdman, director of the Department of Planning, Community and Economic Development.“We’re very excited about having jobs in that area of the city with access to transportation,” Erdman said. “Jobs with benefits that pay a living wage — we’re very interested in jobs like that for our residents.”Erdman said Exact Sciences has not yet asked for tax-increment financing — a program that uses future property tax revenue to help fund construction costs — but she thinks the project would qualify because of the jobs it would add.
“What they’ve told us is that they like this location, like what they could do there ... they want to make sure they can get through the process on time to start construction,” she said.Erdman said the company wants to start construction this fall.The buildings, just off Schroeder Road between Gammon Road and Whitney Way, have been vacant since Spectrum Brands moved to Middleton in October 2013. The research and development center dates back to 1966; the office building was completed in late 1985.They are part of a 33-acre stretch of land owned by AREH, a New York real estate group affiliated with businessman Carl Icahn and Icahn Enterprises Holdings, which bought the two properties for $22 million in 1999, according to the city assessor’s office website.As of 2017, they are assessed at $6.8 million — $5.6 million for the office building and $1.2 million for the tech center.In Fitchburg, city administrator Patrick Marsh said he has not received a written proposal from Exact Sciences at this point; nor has the city made a TIF offer to the company.Marsh said he expects to hear any day now which site Exact is interested in.“We’re hoping it’s Fitchburg,” he said. “We’re very excited about the possibility, and we’d love to work with them.”

Exact Sciences stock falls after share offering
Shares of Exact Sciences Corp.  fell more than 3% Tuesday after the company said it entered an agreement with Jefferies LLC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Robert W. Baird & Co. to sell 7 million shares of its common stock. The underwriters will also have an option to buy additional shares. The company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund its expansion, including to increase laboratory, manufacturing and customer service capacity, to fund product development efforts, and for general corporate and working capital purposes, it said in a statement. Shares had ended the regular session down 1.3%.

Exact Sciences stock surges 9.5% after UnitedHealth says it will cover test
Exact Sciences Corp.  stock surged 9.5% in premarket trade after UnitedHealth Group Inc.  said it plans to cover the company's colon cancer test starting on July 1. Exact Sciences Corp. was targeted by short-seller Citron Research earlier this month, and one of the short-seller's allegations was that UnitedHealth Group wouldn't ever cover the test. UnitedHealth will cover the Cologuard test on an interval of once every three years, adding about 30 million lives for the test, "another major win for EXAS, a coverage decision that comes in nearly a year before we expected," said Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro, who maintained a buy rating and raised his price target to $40 from $38. The decision adds UnitedHealth Group to a list of health insurers covering Cologuard including Aetna , Humana , Cigna  and more, Massaro said. Exact Sciences shares have skyrocketed 51.7% over the last three months, compared with a 2.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Exact Sciences Corp. stock drops 3% after short-seller Citron Research targets its colon cancer test
Exact Sciences Corp.  shares dropped 3.2% to $32.71 on Monday morning after short-seller Citron Research released a report about the company that called its colon cancer test "a seriously inferior product and a disastrous business model." The stock tumbled as much as 8% Monday morning before Exact Sciences Chief Executive Kevin Conroy brawled with Citron Research's Andrew Left on CNBC, after which Exact Sciences stock losses evened out to around 3%. Exact Sciences' Cologuard screening test works using a stool sample that patients send in and, if positive, should be followed by a colonoscopy, according to Exact Sciences. But Citron Research alleged in its report that the product is bad and that not only are doctors not ordering more of it, but Medicare will pay less for the test next year. The company has been successful because "some men think they are 'too cool' (or too scared) to get a colonoscopy, despite the real dangers of colon cancer," the Citron Research report said. But, the report continued, "we believe Exact Sciences is what happens when Wall Street meets bad medicine." But Exact Sciences, for its part, is "extremely confident in the near and long-term growth of Cologuard," said Conroy. "It should be noted that for years 'research institutions' have doubted Cologuard's growth trajectory and ability [to] impact colon cancer screening by detecting early, curable-stage cancer. The Exact Sciences team continues to prove them wrong, as patient demand increases, provider ordering rises, and insurance coverage accelerates." Exact Sciences shares have skyrocketed 65.8% over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Exact Sciences CEO and short-seller go mano-a-mano on CNBC, stock pares losses
Shares of Exact Sciences Corp.  bounced off earlier lows Monday, after Chief Executive Kevin Conroy went mano-a-mano with famed short-seller Andrew Left on CNBC, with Conroy saying Left's bearish comments were "dead wrong." The stock had tumbled as much as 8.1% just before noon ET, after Left's Citron Research released a report saying the company's Cologuard screening test was a "seriously inferior product and a disastrous business model." After both Conroy and Left went at it on CNBC, with Conroy defending the company and Left pushing his bearish view, the stock pared losses to be down just 3.1% around 12:30 p.m., before pulling back to be down 4.9% in recent trade. The stock, which had closed at a record $35.43 on May 5, has more than doubled year to date, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 7.3%.

Exact Sciences stock falls after share offering
Shares of Exact Sciences Corp.  fell more than 3% Tuesday after the company said it entered an agreement with Jefferies LLC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Robert W. Baird & Co. to sell 7 million shares of its common stock. The underwriters will also have an option to buy additional shares. The company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund its expansion, including to increase laboratory, manufacturing and customer service capacity, to fund product development efforts, and for general corporate and working capital purposes, it said in a statement. Shares had ended the regular session down 1.3%.

Exact Sciences stock surges 9.5% after UnitedHealth says it will cover test
Exact Sciences Corp.  stock surged 9.5% in premarket trade after UnitedHealth Group Inc.  said it plans to cover the company's colon cancer test starting on July 1. Exact Sciences Corp. was targeted by short-seller Citron Research earlier this month, and one of the short-seller's allegations was that UnitedHealth Group wouldn't ever cover the test. UnitedHealth will cover the Cologuard test on an interval of once every three years, adding about 30 million lives for the test, "another major win for EXAS, a coverage decision that comes in nearly a year before we expected," said Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro, who maintained a buy rating and raised his price target to $40 from $38. The decision adds UnitedHealth Group to a list of health insurers covering Cologuard including Aetna , Humana , Cigna  and more, Massaro said. Exact Sciences shares have skyrocketed 51.7% over the last three months, compared with a 2.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Exact Sciences Corp. stock drops 3% after short-seller Citron Research targets its colon cancer test
Exact Sciences Corp.  shares dropped 3.2% to $32.71 on Monday morning after short-seller Citron Research released a report about the company that called its colon cancer test "a seriously inferior product and a disastrous business model." The stock tumbled as much as 8% Monday morning before Exact Sciences Chief Executive Kevin Conroy brawled with Citron Research's Andrew Left on CNBC, after which Exact Sciences stock losses evened out to around 3%. Exact Sciences' Cologuard screening test works using a stool sample that patients send in and, if positive, should be followed by a colonoscopy, according to Exact Sciences. But Citron Research alleged in its report that the product is bad and that not only are doctors not ordering more of it, but Medicare will pay less for the test next year. The company has been successful because "some men think they are 'too cool' (or too scared) to get a colonoscopy, despite the real dangers of colon cancer," the Citron Research report said. But, the report continued, "we believe Exact Sciences is what happens when Wall Street meets bad medicine." But Exact Sciences, for its part, is "extremely confident in the near and long-term growth of Cologuard," said Conroy. "It should be noted that for years 'research institutions' have doubted Cologuard's growth trajectory and ability [to] impact colon cancer screening by detecting early, curable-stage cancer. The Exact Sciences team continues to prove them wrong, as patient demand increases, provider ordering rises, and insurance coverage accelerates." Exact Sciences shares have skyrocketed 65.8% over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Exact Sciences CEO and short-seller go mano-a-mano on CNBC, stock pares losses
Shares of Exact Sciences Corp.  bounced off earlier lows Monday, after Chief Executive Kevin Conroy went mano-a-mano with famed short-seller Andrew Left on CNBC, with Conroy saying Left's bearish comments were "dead wrong." The stock had tumbled as much as 8.1% just before noon ET, after Left's Citron Research released a report saying the company's Cologuard screening test was a "seriously inferior product and a disastrous business model." After both Conroy and Left went at it on CNBC, with Conroy defending the company and Left pushing his bearish view, the stock pared losses to be down just 3.1% around 12:30 p.m., before pulling back to be down 4.9% in recent trade. The stock, which had closed at a record $35.43 on May 5, has more than doubled year to date, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 7.3%.

                                         shares dropped 3.2% to $32.71 on Monday morning after short-seller Citron Research released a report about the company that called its colon cancer test "a seriously inferior product and a disastrous business model." The stock tumbled as much as 8% Monday morning before Exact Sciences Chief Executive Kevin Conroy brawled with Citron Research's Andrew Left on CNBC, after which Exact Sciences stock losses evened out to around 3%. Exact Sciences' Cologuard screening test works using a stool sample that patients send in and, if positive, should be followed by a colonoscopy, according to Exact Sciences. But Citron Research alleged in its report that the product is bad and that not only are doctors not ordering more of it, but Medicare will pay less for the test next year. The company has been successful because "some men think they are 'too cool' (or too scared) to get a colonoscopy, despite the real dangers of colon cancer," the Citron Research report said. But, the report continued, "we believe Exact Sciences is what happens when Wall Street meets bad medicine." But Exact Sciences, for its part, is "extremely confident in the near and long-term growth of Cologuard," said Conroy. "It should be noted that for years 'research institutions' have doubted Cologuard's growth trajectory and ability [to] impact colon cancer screening by detecting early, curable-stage cancer. The Exact Sciences team continues to prove them wrong, as patient demand increases, provider ordering rises, and insurance coverage accelerates." Exact Sciences shares have skyrocketed 65.8% over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500

              Alphabet Inc.  announced Monday that is has added Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai to its board.

Since then, Pichai has become one of the most prominent Alphabet executives in public events and earnings calls, along with Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, and could be the highest paid CEO in the U.S. "Sundar has been doing a great job as Google's CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation," Page said in Monday's announcement.

Pandora Media shares gain more than 4% premarket after upbeat analyst note
              
              Shares of internet radio company Pandora Media Inc.  were up 4.5% in premarket trade on Monday after an upbeat analyst note. SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton sent a note to investors on Monday following a meeting with Pandora interim Chief Executive Naveed Chopra. Thornton's key takeaways from the meeting were that the subscription model that many analysts feel Pandora was late to isn't going away, but the company plans to drop investment to maintenance levels. Pandora also plans to increase its focus on monetizing radio, while reallocating subscription investment to sales hires and ad technology. The company also wants to increase focus on cost efficiencies. Thornton said Chopra told him that Pandora's hours growth could hinge on new content and that more details will be available in the coming quarters. Thornton maintains a buy rating on Pandora and a $10.50 12-month price target, which is about 11% above current trading levels. Pandora shares have declined more than 27% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up more than 10% during the same period.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Nektar Therapeutics surges 10% on $150 mln Eli Lilly deal
              
              Nektar Therapeutics  shares surged as much as 10% in premarket trade Monday after the company announced a $150 million deal with Eli Lilly & Co.  to co-develop its immunological therapy NKTR-358. The deal also includes up to $250 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments. Eli Lilly expects an charge of about 9 cents per share to 2017 earnings, and expects to reduce its reported earnings per share guidance for 2017 by that amount. Nektar plans to complete phase 1 clinical development, after which Eli Lilly will shoulder 75% of the cost of phase 2 development, with Nektar responsible for the remaining 25%. Eli Lilly will pay for all costs of global commercialization. Nektar has the option to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis, could receive royalties that increase depending on its phase 3 investment and product sales and will have the option to co-promote the drug in the U.S., the company said. NKTR-358 may address immune system imbalance for many kinds of autoimmune conditions, Nektar said, and the therapy had its first human dose in early-stage clinical development in March. Eli Lilly shares were not active in premarket trade on Monday. Nektar shares have surged 17.9% over the last three months, compared with a 1.5% rise in Eli Lilly shares and a 4.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

Gilead Sciences says late-stage results for HIV drug combination are similar to standard of care
              
              Gilead Sciences Inc.  said early Monday that its HIV combination treatment had similar safety and efficacy results in two late-stage clinical trials to the standard of care. The data, along with two other late-stage clinical trials, are the basis of Gilead's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, the company said. The combination of the drugs bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is intended for patients who are new to treatment. One of the phase 3 studies, which enrolled 629 patients, found that 92.4% of patients on the BIC/FTC/TAF combination treatment achieved the primary endpoint at week 48, compared with 93% of patients achieving the primary endpoint on the other regimen. In the other study, which enrolled 645 patients, 89.4% of those on the BIC/FTC/TAF regimen and 92.9% of those on another regimen achieved the primary endpoint at week 48. In both studies, discontinuations due to adverse events were low, according to Gilead. Two studies looking at the combination in  virologically suppressed adult patients are ongoing and are also part of the company's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, Gilead said. Gilead shares surged 0.7% in pre-market trade before declining 0.2% pre-market. Shares have surged 11.3% over the last three months, compared with a 4.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

WebMD to be bought by KKR's Internet Brands for $2.8 billion
              
              WebMD Health Corp.  announced an agreement Monday to be acquired by KKR & Co. LP's Internet Brands in a deal valued at $2.8 billion. Under terms of the deal, WebMD shareholders will get $66.50 in cash for each share they own, a 20.5% premium to Friday's closing price of $55.19. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter. The deal comes after the health information services company announced in February that it was commencing a process to explore strategic alternatives. "We believe that this transaction will provide additional flexibility and resources to deliver increased value to consumers, healthcare professionals, employers, and health plan participants," said WebMD Chief Executive Steven Zatz. The stock, which is currently halted for news, was up 18% prior to the halt. It has run up 11.3% year to date through Friday, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF  has climbed 17.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%. KKR's stock has soared 25.9% this year.

Trump to make statement on healthcare Monday: reports
              
              U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to deliver a statement on health care Monday, according to media reports. Trump is expected to make the comments at 3:15 p.m. Eastern Time, just ahead of an event with "victims of Obamacare" at the White House. Last week Republicans ditched a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously after four senators refused to support it. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he plans to hold a vote to repeal Obamacare this week. In a warning over healthcare late Sunday Trump tweeted: "If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!"

Share Your Success












Company Profile: Exact Sciences Corporation
Products: Exact Sciences is a molecular diagnostics company committed to playing a role in the eradication of colorectal cancer, the second deadliest type of cancer in the U.S. As part of this mission, Exact Sciences developed and received FDA approval for Cologuard, the first noninvasive screening test for colorectal cancer that analyzes both stool DNA and blood biomarkers.  Cologuard is available by prescription through health care providers.  The test offers people 50 and older at average risk for colorectal cancer an easy-to-use screening test they can do in the privacy of their own home
Location: Madison
Employees: More than 500
Founded: 1995; moved to Madison from Boston in 2009
Leadership: Kevin Conroy has been president and CEO of Exact Sciences since 2009.  He added the role of chairman of Exact Sciences in March 2014. Prior to joining the company, he was president and CEO of Third Wave Technologies, a molecular diagnostics company. Maneesh Arora joined the company in 2009 as CFO and was named COO in 2012.
Market: Colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least detected cancers because nearly half of those who should be screened for the disease have not undergone adequate screening. Exact Sciences believes the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly, noninvasive test.
Business Success: Upon FDA approval of Cologuard in August 2014, Exact Sciences also received a proposed coverage memorandum from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  Cologuard is the first product to take part in the joint FDA and CMS parallel review pilot program in which both agencies simultaneously reviewed medical devices.
Since relocating to Wisconsin in 2009, Exact Sciences has grown from three employees to a team of more than 500. Because of the success of Cologuard, the company in February announced plans to invest more than $26 million in capital expenditures at its Madison facility, a project that calls for hiring more than 750 new employees through 2020. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) is providing up to $9 million in state tax credits to reward the company’s commitment to Wisconsin.
“We moved Exact Sciences to Madison in 2009 because of the state’s strong, dedicated workers and the first-class universities to recruit talent,” Conroy says. “With the FDA’s approval of Cologuard and our pipeline for potential new cancer screening tests, WEDC is offering another incentive to continue growing our team in Wisconsin.”
Wisconsin Business Environment Benefits: Beyond bringing hundreds of family-supporting jobs to the Madison area, the innovations being developed and commercialized by Exact Sciences exemplify the state’s strong bioscience industry. Wisconsin’s bioscience industry is sizable and growing, as the industry increased employment by 8.2 percent from 2007 to 2012, according to a 2014 report from Battelle/BIO. During that period, double-digit job gains occurred in three of five bioscience sectors: drugs and pharmaceuticals; research, testing and medical labs; and medical device manufacturing. The state has nearly 32,000 jobs in the bioscience and nearly 1,400 companies in the industry, according to the report.

(NASDAQ:    EXAS) today announced that Cologuard, the first and only FDA-approved noninvasive, stool DNA-based colorectal cancer screening test, has won the 2016 10th Annual Prix Galien USA Award for best medical technology product.

"It's an extraordinary honor for Cologuard and the Exact Sciences team to be recognized in such a distinguished forum," said Graham Lidgard, Ph.D., chief science officer of Exact Sciences. "This Prix Galien award highlights not only the breakthrough science behind Cologuard, but also the unrivaled team that worked to develop and bring to market an innovation with the potential to make a significant impact in eradicating colorectal cancer. We are humbled and thankful to be counted among the companies honored by the Galien Foundation."
Awarded in more than a dozen countries, the Prix Galien awards recognize the best in biomedical research and development. Nominees for the Prix Galien USA awards represent the most innovative biopharma and medical technologies addressing public health priorities and are evaluated by a prestigious committee comprised of nine renowned leaders from the biomedical industry and academia, including four Nobel Laureates. 
The awards were presented at the Prix Galien USA Awards Ceremony, which took place on Oct. 27 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.  
About the Galien Foundation The Galien Foundation fosters, recognizes and rewards excellence in scientific innovation to improve the state of human health. Our vision is to be the catalyst for the development of the next generation of innovative treatment and technologies that will impact human health and save lives.
The Foundation oversees and directs activities in the USA for the Prix Galien, an international award that recognizes outstanding achievements in improving the human condition through the development of innovative therapies. The Prix Galien was created in France in 1970 in honor of Galen, the father of medical science and modern pharmacology. Worldwide, the Prix Galien is regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in biopharmaceutical and medical technology research.

About Cologuard Cologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014 and results from Exact Sciences' prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and the American Cancer Society's (2014) colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Stool DNA is included in the combined screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society/U.S. Multi-Society Task Force/American College of Radiology (2008), the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines (2009) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not for everyone and is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk individuals. False positives and false negatives do occur. Any positive test result should be followed by a diagnostic colonoscopy. Following a negative result, patients should continue participating in a screening program at an interval and with a method appropriate for the individual patient. Cologuard performance when used for repeat testing has not been evaluated or established. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.CologuardTest.com. Rx Only.
About Exact Sciences Corp. Exact Sciences Corp. is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of the deadliest forms of cancer. The company has exclusive intellectual property protecting its non-invasive, molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal cancer.
