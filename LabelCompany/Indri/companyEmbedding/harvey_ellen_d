NBC Greenlights Kids’ Variety Show From Steve Harvey & Ellen DeGeneres

Ellen DeGeneres and Steve Harvey are teaming up for “Little Big Shots,” a children’s comedy variety show, which has landed an eight-episode order from NBC.
Harvey will host the series, which showcases some of the world’s most talented kiddos — young musicians, dancers, singers and more — who engage in hilarious conversations and interviews with the emcee. The pint-sized contestants will “slay with their cuteness” and “wow with their accomplishments,” proving that talent is born, and not made.
The series, exec produced by DeGeneres and Harvey, hails from Warner Horizon Television, East 112th Street Productions and A Very Good Production. Jeff Kleeman and Gerald Washington will also serve as exec producers.







The project marks a continuation for DeGeneres producing with NBC. Her short-lived sitcom “One Big Happy,” on which she was an exec producer, was canceled on Friday in a slew of comedy cancelations at the network.

The show brought back a lot of memories because it reminded me so much of Kids Say The Darnest Things. Just lots of good clean laughs. Put the show back on TV.

You need to have Steve step away from the spotlight and give more time to the little stars.  I hope the producers listen as this is a common thought of many people

Note to the producers and Cameron in. Week to ninja watch the kids for form. We don’t turn in to watch these make a fool of himself with the camera on him 80% of the time. The little girl who is on there to Yoda we never did get to hear her Yoda but we got to hear Steve show his ass.

How did you go about selecting talent for the show? Are you still looking for more children and is there an age limit? I’d love to have my 13 year old granddaughter on your show. She sings.

This show will be great I have a great nephew has a mind of his own and can quote many sayings,  of Dr. Martin Luther King, the talents to sing  and dance sit at a piano with the look of John Legend dance moves of Hammer, the coolness of a preacher if that is not a combination, I would love to get more info about the auditions and needed criteria to possibility to participate on the show..he is eight but you wouldn’t believe it

I am extremely thrilled about the idea of little big shots. My daughter and my niece are very talented in singing.  They perform at concerts and in church. However my daughter is too young for American idol or the voice. She is only 11years old and have a voice that raised the roof. I would love for her to audition for the show.  Please let me know how where and when auditions begin.  Steve and Ellen you are geniuses

So apparently it isn’t enough that children are already exposed to her daytime liberal and homosexual evangelism?  If you want to brainwash those little minds you have to train them young and often with daily reinforcement. Hey Hollywood – Just leave the kids alone, enough is enough.
As for Harvey, turns out that he’s just a hypocrite when money hangs in the balance.

 Dennis says:

Yeah, me again – I agree with every word you said. I’ll just add that Ellen appears demonic if you look at her eyes and Steve Harvey is an incredible sell-out. Embarrassing. REALLY hope this is a fail.

I can’t watch anything with Steve Harvey in it at all.  I just can’t trust someone whose morals come from the threat of eternal damnation from some god.  You know if his morals came from himself then I might be able to trust him.

To brainwash them, they need a lot of access to them at a young age. Hollywood’s denizens know exactly what they are doing – this is no accident.

You know what an executive producer is, right? She doesn’t talk to the kids or go near them in the context of the show. Her job is to produce the show, she sits in an office and manages the look and feel of the show, writes out the themes for the episodes and directs the staff. IF she talks to the kids, its as she passes them by off stage. There’s handlers for the kids, special security (because federal laws state kids have to be supervised by a licensed handler even if parents are there too), stage managers, directors, censors, makeup people, sound people, security, and whole mess of other people who’s job it is to get the kids ready/n/off the stage. The majority of her contact will be with the people who work for her and the parents of the children.

Sorry Universal I been used to style projects which have been sold to your company for the past five years and some of my scripts have been used (violated and used) in your movies.  I have never been paid for this and today I got baliffs coming round and a lot of the time I go hungry coz if I do other work to pay the bills they abuse me in the contracts too.  Plus they selling my writing work everywhere so really by now I should be getting paid too.  I just wondered what I should do when the baliffs come should I send them to these people’s offices who been making money out of me?

After reading your comment, I find it very hard to believe you’ve ever written a script. Your grammar is atrocious, as are your sentence structures.  You are obviously trying to make yourself something you are not and you failed miserably…

 Guy Smiley says:

By the looks of your writing, nobody has ever used your “scripts” for anything. Unless you were writing a memior called “The Illiterate High School Dropout,” I have a hard time believing you’ve ever written word in your life before this comment.

Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. They have more than 20,000 students—from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries—studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy.
GW comprises three campuses—Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, Va.—as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, Va.
