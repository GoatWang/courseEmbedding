Dining & Nutrition
Dining and nutrition reflects the exceptional dining experience we consistently provide, serving meals that are not only delicious and varied, but also healthy and nutritionally optimized for the needs of our residents.
You've probably seen our executive chef Brad Miller on the Food Network or maybe even dined at one of his acclaimed Southern California restaurants.
These days you're just as likely to find him in the Five Star development kitchen working with our community chefs to create new signature recipes, perfect regional menus and dream up innovative ways to redefine senior dining.

Alzheimer's & Memory Care
Bridge to Rediscovery is Five Star Senior Living's innovative, award-winning approach to Alzheimer's and dementia care. The program helps those with Alzheimer's and other dementia-related challenges rediscover the joy in everyday life. Bridge to Rediscovery celebrates the spirit within each resident through personalized activities that encourage creativity and self-expression. We work with residents individually, striving for small successes that help create a sense of accomplishment.

Assisted Living
Assisted living residents are those who do not need 24-hour or complex medical supervision, but may need or want assistance with some aspects of daily life such as bathing and dressing, getting around, or medication reminders.
Independent Living
Independent Living is for seniors who are able to live on their own in an apartment or house, but who want the convenience of living within a community that provides services and amenities such as housekeeping, social activities, dining, transportation, and/or the option of assistance with daily tasks or medical care if they need it later. 
Personal Care 
In Personal Care communities, our staff provide assistance with daily tasks such as dressing, bathing, transportation, medication management. 

Rehabilitation & Wellness
Rehabilitation and Wellness services are designed to help you maintain and improve independence. We offer rehabilitation for: 

Short-term inpatient stays, often needed after surgical procedures
Home health care in our assisted living communities
Out-patient rehabilitation for adults of all ages
Long-term skilled nursing care residents

Respite Care / Short-term Stays
Respite Care / Short-term Stays are great for seniors when families travel out of town or simply need a break from the stresses of caregiving. They can also be a good option for those considering senior living and want to "try it out" before making a long-term commitment. Short-term stays allow residents to enjoy housekeeping services, community activities, dining, and all other amenities enjoyed by our permanent residents. In addition to the benefits of physical care, our short-term residents often make friendships that enrich life in a way that only connecting with others can. 

Skilled Nursing Care
Skilled Nursing Care is for those who need ongoing long-term nursing care or for those who need short-term concentrated rehabilitation while recovering from surgery or an illness. Five Star communities provide the sophisticated medical services and 24-hour supervision needed by residents with serious health challenges.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
