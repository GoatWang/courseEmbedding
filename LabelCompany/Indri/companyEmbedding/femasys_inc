ATLANTA, Dec. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Femasys Inc., a developer of innovative medical devices for the women's healthcare market, today announced that it has closed $40 million in Series C financing.  The transaction was arranged by Salem Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment bank which also participated as a principal investor. The Series C syndicate included multiple institutional investors, family offices and a multibillion-dollar global medical device company. The funding will be used primarily to support the pivotal testing of FemBloc™, the Company's revolutionary, non-surgical permanent contraception solution. Femasys designed FemBloc to provide women with the first non-surgical permanent contraceptive option delivered exclusively in the physician's office.

"We are thrilled with the level of enthusiasm in this oversubscribed round of funding and grateful for the backing from our new and existing investors," said Kathy Lee-Sepsick, Femasys President and CEO. "Their financial investment enables us to conduct and complete the FemBloc clinical plan, which will support our planned premarket approval application (PMA), and ultimately, our vision of improving the lives of women by providing access to an ideal permanent contraception solution that is safe and highly effective for women in the U.S. and worldwide."

Femasys also announced that it has gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to launch a prospective, multi-center, clinical trial to evaluate the safety of the FemBloc permanent contraceptive system while preventing pregnancy. The clinical trial, which will enroll women who desire permanent birth control by occlusion of the fallopian tubes, will be the Company's first trial to evaluate the complete FemBloc contraceptive system for its intended use.

"FemBloc is designed to fill the unmet need of a safe, permanent contraceptive method that can be easily implemented since it does not require specialized surgical skills or investment in costly surgical equipment," said Mimi Zieman, M.D., Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Femasys and a board certified Ob/Gyn specializing in Family Planning. "This contrasts with current female sterilization options that have the inconvenience and risks associated with surgery and anesthesia for tubal ligation; and for hysteroscopic procedures - the challenge of placing the devices correctly, and concerns with long-term use."

Dechert LLP served as legal counsel to Femasys Inc. while Baker Botts LLP served as investor counsel.

Femasys Signs Distribution Agreement with McKesson Medical-Surgical
for FemCerv Device for Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer
ATLANTA, GA, July 8, 2014/ PR Newswire/ Femasys Inc., an emerging medical device develop-er of women's healthcare solutions, announced today that it has entered into a nationwide distribu-tion agreement with McKesson Medical-Surgical to sell and distribute Femasys' FEMCERV™ Endocervical Sampler.  FEMCERV collects a tissue sample of a woman's endocervical canal for histological analysis when cervical cancer is suspected. 
       
       Under terms of the agreement, McKesson Medical-Surgical will sell and distribute the FEMCERV device nationwide through its sales force.  Kathy Lee-Sepsick, President & CEO of Femasys commented, "We are thrilled to create an alliance with McKesson Medical-Surgical in bringing FEMCERV to the market as a novel new advancement in tissue sample collection for cervical cancer diagnosis.  With McKesson Medical-Surgical's extensive market presence, physicians will gain access across the country to this much needed technology that has been designed with the woman and her anatomy in mind. Clinical data has demonstrated that physicians find FEMCERV easy to insert and well tolerated by almost all patients, who experienced mild or no discomfort." 
       
       "We're pleased to offer Femasys' FEMCERV product to our customers," said Joan Eliasek, Senior Vice President, Supplier Management, McKesson Medical-Surgical. "As a company, we are in business for one reason: better health. And fighting cancer is a major aspect of better health in our country. We are glad to offer products to our customers that help them deliver better care for their patients."
About FEMCERV 
  FEMCERV is intended for women who have received an abnormal pap smear result or have other factors that require a sampling of her cervical canal (i.e. cervical lesions extending into the canal or when there is undiagnosed uterine bleeding).  The device minimizes the risk of incomplete sampling and optimizes diagnostic acuity by collecting a complete 360° sample, while protecting the sample from contamination.  Endocervical curettage has the potential to decrease the number of unnecessary surgical treatments and to play a role in reducing the number of undiagnosed cases of cervical cancer. 

  For additional information on the FemCerv device, please visit www.femcerv.com. 
  
About McKesson  
  McKesson Medical-Surgical's parent, McKesson Corporation, currently ranked 14th on the FOR-TUNE 500 list, is a healthcare services and information technology company dedicated to making the business of healthcare run better. McKesson Medical-Surgical works with payers, hospitals, physician offices, pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies and others across the spectrum of care to build healthier organizations that deliver better care to patients in every setting.

ATLANTA, April 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Femasys Inc., a developer of innovative medical devices for the women's healthcare market has raised a $10.2 million financing round.  The investor group was led by Legacy Capital Partners and Mario Family Partners, the family offices of life sciences industry veterans John Adams, Jr. and Dr. Ernest Mario. Joining the Company's board of directors is Mr. Adams, former CEO of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics.  Salem Partners, a Los Angeles based investment bank focused on life sciences, advised the Company on the transaction and participated as a principal investor.
Femasys has developed a groundbreaking non-surgical female sterilization device (FemBloc™ Permanent Contraceptive System) that allows physicians to deliver exclusively in their office a biomaterial through a catheter based system to permanently block the fallopian tubes that substantially reduces patient risks and costs by eliminating the use of anesthesia and permanent implants.  The company has also expanded options for women with its two commercially available products for diagnosis of infertility (FemVue® Saline-Air device) and cervical cancer (FemCerv® Endocervical Sampler) that present significant advantages for the patient, physician and healthcare system.    
"We are pleased to have the support and confidence of this esteemed group of investors," said Kathy Lee-Sepsick, Femasys' President and CEO. "This round of funding will enable Femasys to invest in the people and programs necessary to achieve the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) milestone for FemBloc and expand commercialization globally for our diagnostic products to allow women access to better options when it comes to managing their health needs."
"Femasys fills an important and significant gap in the women's healthcare continuum," said John Q. Adams, Jr., Legacy Capital Partners. "We believe that both physicians and patients will have great interest in the innovative new technologies and that we can provide value to the company through our highly experienced investor syndicate."

Femasys has expanded options for women with its two commercially available products for diagnosis of infertility (FemVue® Saline-Air device) and cervical cancer (FemCerv® Endocervical Sampler).












About FemVue


The FemVue® Saline-Air device is used to introduce a consistent mixture of saline and air contrast in a controlled fashion for the tubal evaluation portion of the Sono HSG. The bright echoes of the air bubbles can be seen flowing into and through each fallopian tube, providing physicians an effective contrast to make a tubal patency determination.

ATLANTA, Dec. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Femasys Inc., a developer of innovative medical devices for the women's healthcare market, today announced that it has closed $40 million in Series C financing.  The transaction was arranged by Salem Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment bank which also participated as a principal investor. The Series C syndicate included multiple institutional investors, family offices and a multibillion-dollar global medical device company. The funding will be used primarily to support the pivotal testing of FemBloc™, the Company's revolutionary, non-surgical permanent contraception solution. Femasys designed FemBloc to provide women with the first non-surgical permanent contraceptive option delivered exclusively in the physician's office.

"We are thrilled with the level of enthusiasm in this oversubscribed round of funding and grateful for the backing from our new and existing investors," said Kathy Lee-Sepsick, Femasys President and CEO. "Their financial investment enables us to conduct and complete the FemBloc clinical plan, which will support our planned premarket approval application (PMA), and ultimately, our vision of improving the lives of women by providing access to an ideal permanent contraception solution that is safe and highly effective for women in the U.S. and worldwide."

Femasys also announced that it has gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to launch a prospective, multi-center, clinical trial to evaluate the safety of the FemBloc permanent contraceptive system while preventing pregnancy. The clinical trial, which will enroll women who desire permanent birth control by occlusion of the fallopian tubes, will be the Company's first trial to evaluate the complete FemBloc contraceptive system for its intended use.

"FemBloc is designed to fill the unmet need of a safe, permanent contraceptive method that can be easily implemented since it does not require specialized surgical skills or investment in costly surgical equipment," said Mimi Zieman, M.D., Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Femasys and a board certified Ob/Gyn specializing in Family Planning. "This contrasts with current female sterilization options that have the inconvenience and risks associated with surgery and anesthesia for tubal ligation; and for hysteroscopic procedures - the challenge of placing the devices correctly, and concerns with long-term use."

Dechert LLP served as legal counsel to Femasys Inc. while Baker Botts LLP served as investor counsel.
