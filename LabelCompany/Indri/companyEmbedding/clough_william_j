Obituary: Mrs. William J. Clough 

































The John Clough Genealogical SocietyObituary: Mrs. William J. Clough
December 28, 2014 By fclough MRS. WILLIAM J. CLOUGH
The entire membership of the Clough Society share the sorrow with Past-President William J. Clough for the loss of his wife, Cousin Nell, who was suddenly ill with thrombosis and taken to the Cottage hospital in Woodsville, N. H., and died in the night of February 28. We all recall how she welcomed us to her home for the picnic in 1949 and her quiet, friendly cooperation while her husband was our president.
She was born in Manchester, N. H., on Jan. 25, 1884, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sargent formerly of North Haverhill. She was active in the church, Eastern Star, and Women’s Club. Her home was most attractive with many artistic products of her handicraft. She managed an extensive summer cabin colony near her home.
She leaves her aged father whom she cared for in her home, her husband, two daughters, Mrs. James Morrill and Mrs. Peter Kimball and two grandsons and a granddaughter.
One of her hobbies was her garden where she cultivated roses, and many varieties of perennials as well as annuals, especially poppies and pansies.
We shall remember Cousin Nell for the kindness to all of us and for the beauty that she created. Our sympathy is expressed to the family.
