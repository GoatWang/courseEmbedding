Cheyne Capital Closes CRECH III Fund With Subscriptions Exceeding Target By Nearly 20 Per Cent






Business Wire




Mar 22, 2016 10:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Cheyne Capital Management (UK) LLP ("Cheyne Capital") today announced it has closed its Cheyne Real Estate Credit Holdings Fund III ("CRECH III") above target at approximately $770 million, an 18 per cent increase from its initial goal of $650 million, bringing the net assets of Cheyne's Real Estate team to $2.1 billion. CRECH III is the third fund in Cheyne Capital's real estate direct lending strategy, which started in 2011, following the launch of the Cheyne Real Estate Debt Fund, focused on CMBS and RMBS, in 2009. CRECH III provides real estate loan solutions to help fill the gap left by European banks as they continue to retreat from lending and focus on asset disposals and recapitalisation. Since the launch of the CRECH programme in 2011, Cheyne has deployed over $1.5 billion in private credit investments and special situation opportunities. The invested sum is spread across 38 different deals. Of these deals, the funds have realised seven investments with a realised profit (comprising coupon and profit participations) of $67 million against an investment sum of $248 million (representing a total return of 27%).  "We have known for a long time that there are ample opportunities in European real estate lending, and the closure and oversubscription of our third fund focused on this sector is continued proof that it remains ripe for investing. We plan to launch a fourth fund later this year," said Ravi Stickney, Partner and Head of Real Estate for Cheyne Capital. "Europe's continued emergence from the financial crisis as it rights the ship will fuel a strong pipeline of compelling deals in this sector, which will be led by an increased demand for alternative credit needed to fill the void left by the big banks retreating from this space".  "Our long-term focus on European real estate has allowed us to build a large and experienced team that can identify and fund attractive opportunities in the sector, and the closure of our third fund in this space above target is an excellent testament to this ability." said Stuart Fiertz, Co-Founder, President and Director of Credit Research for Cheyne Capital.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
