The Repricing Amendment, among other things, reduces the applicable margin on the Tranche B Term Loans under the Credit Agreement to 225 basis points for Tranche B Term Loans that are Base Rate Loans and to 325 basis points for Tranche B Term Loans that are Eurodollar Loans, and establishes a soft call protection through January 10, 2018 of 1.0% for certain prepayments, refinancings and amendments for the primary purpose of reducing the effective yield on such indebtedness to less than the effective yield applicable to all or a portion of the Tranche B Term Loan, but excluding certain change of control transactions.

History[edit]
1998-2006[edit]
In 1998, telecom services integrator and network solutions provider Global Internetworking Inc. was founded in McLean, Virginia.[1] That same year, European Telecom and Technology was founded in London.[1]
In April 2005, Mercator Partners Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company created by Reston-based investment bank Mercator Capital, raised $59.5 million in an initial public stock offering, intending to use the money to buy a telecommunications company.[2] Mercator Partners bought both Global Internetworking Inc. and European Telecommunications & Technology in 2006, merging the two companies' operations and renaming itself Global Telecom & Technology, Inc. (GTT).[3][4]
2006-Present[edit]
In December 2009, GTT acquired Denver-based WBS Connect in a stock and cash transaction, shifting its business model from being an exclusively virtual network operator and telecom solutions integrator to a network operator providing IP transit and Ethernet services.[5]
In June 2011 GTT acquired PacketExchange, a privately held UK company and operator of a global backbone providing IP transit and MPLS transport services, for $20 million in cash.[6]
In May 2012 GTT acquired nLayer Communications, a privately held global IP backbone, for $18 million. nLayer founder Richard Steenbergen joined GTT as CTO.[7]
In April 2013 GTT acquired the Tier 1 IP network Tinet from Inteliquent, for $54.5 million in cash and services.[8] In June 2013 GTT was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol GTT.
On January 14, 2014, GTT (Global Telecom & Technology) announced that the company was officially changing its name to GTT Communications, Inc.[9] In February 2014, GTT Communications, Inc. announced the opening of a new office in Hong Kongâs Central District, bringing its total global presence to 9 offices in 6 countries.[10] In October 2014, GTT Communications, Inc. announced it had closed the acquisition of UNSi, a communications company providing data services to large enterprise and carrier clients.[11]
On February 19, 2015, GTT entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MegaPathâs Managed Services business, which provides private wide-area-networking, Internet access services, managed services and managed security to multinational clients.[12] In July 2015, GTT Communications, Inc. (GTT) and Saudi Telecom Company (STC) jointly announced 100-Gigabit IP Transit connectivity services to the Middle East.[13] On October 22, 2015, GTT acquired One Source Networks (OSN), a provider of global data, Internet, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking and managed services to Fortune 1000 companies.[14]
On February 9, 2016, GTT acquired Telnes Broadband for $18 million.[15] On October 7, 2016, GTT announced the award of Government Services Administrations (GSA) IT Schedule 70 Contract. The IT Schedule 70 is the largest acquisition vehicle in the United States federal government.[16]
On January 9, 2017, GTT completed the acquisition of Hibernia Networks for $590 million. The company acquired five subsea cables, including Hibernia Express, the lowest latency transatlantic cable system, and eight cable landing standings. By May, the company had 23 offices located around the world and over 300 points of presence.[17] In May, GTT bought IP broker and aggregator Giglinx, for $21 million.[18] On June 19, GTT announced it was acquiring Perseus Telecom, a microwave service provider for financial services companies, for $37.5 million.[19] On June 26, GTT announced it was acquiring Massachusetts-based telecommunications provider Global Capacity, for $100 million and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. The deal, anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2017, was expected to help GTT expand its SD-WAN and data center services.[20]
Services[edit]
Internet services[edit]
As of 2014, GTT was one of the five largest Internet backbones in terms of traffic.[21] The company's high speed Internet services include IP Transit, Dedicated Internet Access and Broadband Internet services. With more than 165,000 routes, GTT directly connects to one-third of global Internet prefixes.[citation needed] GTT also operates a 100% native dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) carrier class network built on optical infrastructure.[22]
EtherCloud services[edit]
GTT provides cloud connectivity services for private, public and hybrid wide area networks. The company reportedly has over 300 point-of-presence locations in over 80 countries.[17][23]
Managed services[edit]
GTT offers end-to-end network management, with managed services that include Managed Network Services, Multilayered Security Services, Managed Secure Access,[12] and Managed Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) services.[24]
Voice and unified communications[edit]
GTT's IP-based communication and collaboration services include SIP Trunking, Hosted Enterprise PBX, and Cloud-based call and contact center, and call routing capabilities. The network is interoperable with major platforms including Microsoft Lync, Avaya, Cisco, ShoreTel and Siemens.[14]

History[edit]
1998-2006[edit]
In 1998, telecom services integrator and network solutions provider Global Internetworking Inc. was founded in McLean, Virginia.[1] That same year, European Telecom and Technology was founded in London.[1]
In April 2005, Mercator Partners Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company created by Reston-based investment bank Mercator Capital, raised $59.5 million in an initial public stock offering, intending to use the money to buy a telecommunications company.[2] Mercator Partners bought both Global Internetworking Inc. and European Telecommunications & Technology in 2006, merging the two companies' operations and renaming itself Global Telecom & Technology, Inc. (GTT).[3][4]
2006-Present[edit]
In December 2009, GTT acquired Denver-based WBS Connect in a stock and cash transaction, shifting its business model from being an exclusively virtual network operator and telecom solutions integrator to a network operator providing IP transit and Ethernet services.[5]
In June 2011 GTT acquired PacketExchange, a privately held UK company and operator of a global backbone providing IP transit and MPLS transport services, for $20 million in cash.[6]
In May 2012 GTT acquired nLayer Communications, a privately held global IP backbone, for $18 million. nLayer founder Richard Steenbergen joined GTT as CTO.[7]
In April 2013 GTT acquired the Tier 1 IP network Tinet from Inteliquent, for $54.5 million in cash and services.[8] In June 2013 GTT was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol GTT.
On January 14, 2014, GTT (Global Telecom & Technology) announced that the company was officially changing its name to GTT Communications, Inc.[9] In February 2014, GTT Communications, Inc. announced the opening of a new office in Hong Kongâs Central District, bringing its total global presence to 9 offices in 6 countries.[10] In October 2014, GTT Communications, Inc. announced it had closed the acquisition of UNSi, a communications company providing data services to large enterprise and carrier clients.[11]
On February 19, 2015, GTT entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MegaPathâs Managed Services business, which provides private wide-area-networking, Internet access services, managed services and managed security to multinational clients.[12] In July 2015, GTT Communications, Inc. (GTT) and Saudi Telecom Company (STC) jointly announced 100-Gigabit IP Transit connectivity services to the Middle East.[13] On October 22, 2015, GTT acquired One Source Networks (OSN), a provider of global data, Internet, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking and managed services to Fortune 1000 companies.[14]
On February 9, 2016, GTT acquired Telnes Broadband for $18 million.[15] On October 7, 2016, GTT announced the award of Government Services Administrations (GSA) IT Schedule 70 Contract. The IT Schedule 70 is the largest acquisition vehicle in the United States federal government.[16]
On January 9, 2017, GTT completed the acquisition of Hibernia Networks for $590 million. The company acquired five subsea cables, including Hibernia Express, the lowest latency transatlantic cable system, and eight cable landing standings. By May, the company had 23 offices located around the world and over 300 points of presence.[17] In May, GTT bought IP broker and aggregator Giglinx, for $21 million.[18] On June 19, GTT announced it was acquiring Perseus Telecom, a microwave service provider for financial services companies, for $37.5 million.[19] On June 26, GTT announced it was acquiring Massachusetts-based telecommunications provider Global Capacity, for $100 million and 1.85 million shares of GTT common stock. The deal, anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2017, was expected to help GTT expand its SD-WAN and data center services.[20]
Services[edit]
Internet services[edit]
As of 2014, GTT was one of the five largest Internet backbones in terms of traffic.[21] The company's high speed Internet services include IP Transit, Dedicated Internet Access and Broadband Internet services. With more than 165,000 routes, GTT directly connects to one-third of global Internet prefixes.[citation needed] GTT also operates a 100% native dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) carrier class network built on optical infrastructure.[22]
EtherCloud services[edit]
GTT provides cloud connectivity services for private, public and hybrid wide area networks. The company reportedly has over 300 point-of-presence locations in over 80 countries.[17][23]
Managed services[edit]
GTT offers end-to-end network management, with managed services that include Managed Network Services, Multilayered Security Services, Managed Secure Access,[12] and Managed Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) services.[24]
Voice and unified communications[edit]
GTT's IP-based communication and collaboration services include SIP Trunking, Hosted Enterprise PBX, and Cloud-based call and contact center, and call routing capabilities. The network is interoperable with major platforms including Microsoft Lync, Avaya, Cisco, ShoreTel and Siemens.[14]

The Repricing Amendment is with and among KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent (the Agent), certain lenders party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and KeyBank National Association, as the Additional Tranche B Term Loan Lender. The Repricing Amendment is to the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 9, 2017 by and among the company, as borrower, KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, letter of credit issuer and a lender, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch and SunTrust Bank, as the Syndication Agents, KeyBank Capital Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, Citizens Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and ING Capital LLC, as Documentation Agents, and the other lenders party thereto.
