Back in November, we told you that Thomson Reuters was looking to unload BAR/BRI, its bar exam preparation business. The news was huge, given BAR/BRI’s status as a de facto finishing school for would-be lawyers. 
Today, it appears that BAR/BRI has found a home. According to various reports, BAR/BRI will be acquired by Leeds Equity Partners. Leeds is a private equity firm that specializes in educational products and services.  
Above the Law just spoke with Jeffrey T. Leeds, the co-founder and president of Leeds. He called BAR/BRI a “jewel” for the firm. And since the man is a graduate of Harvard Law School (Class of ’83), he knows just how important BAR/BRI is to our system of legal education… .
 


Thomson Reuters seems to be stepping away from the American legal market: at the same time they announced they were looking to sell BAR/BRI, they announced they were acquiring an outsourcing firm, Pangea3. But Leeds is focused on how crucial bar prep is to American-trained lawyers.  




“BAR/BRI is an important part of legal education,” Jeffrey Leeds told us. “It should be viewed really as the last sprint.”
Leeds, who said he is friends with Stanford Law Dean Larry Kramer, understands just how important BAR/BRI is to the next generation of lawyers. “It’s high stakes for everybody,” he said. 
For current law students who need to pass the bar now and don’t have the time to allow new corporate heads to understand the education business, there doesn’t seem to be much to worry about. Leeds talked about the breadth of educational companies his firm currently owns and the strong educational bona fides of his board of directors. The Leeds board currently sports two former Department of Education heads, Roderick Paige and Richard Riley, and the board is led by a former Secretary of State, General Colin L. Powell. I think that all those people can figure out a way to keep BAR/BRI students knee-deep in hearsay exceptions. 
But of more import, Leeds seemed committed to the product and the future of the American-trained lawyer. He said that he wants to build on BAR/BRI’s current offerings and expand into other areas. That’s a vote of confidence at a time when traditional three-year law graduates face an uncertain job market. 
The deal hasn’t been finalized yet, but Leeds reports that they have a purchase agreement, and he expects the final details to be worked out over the next six weeks. As we’ve previously noted, there will be no interruption of BAR/BRI services. 
Hopefully BAR/BRI has a bright future, because that would speak well for the health of the American legal market for young attorneys.

At Which Firms Are Women Thriving? Findings From The ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index

Law firms blow a lot of rhetorical hot air affirming their commitment to achieving gender diversity in the workplace. Yet, despite some isolated efforts to hire and retain more female attorneys and promote more women into partnership, little tangible progress has been made to improve the position of women in the profession…

Covenant Review adds product development head to team


June 29, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Covenant Review, a provider of indenture and loan agreement analysis, which is part of Fulcrum Financial Data, has hired Manish Aggarwal as head of new product development. Aggarwal is co-founder of Xtract Research, a covenant analysis platform that was later acquired by MergerMarket in 2010. FFD is backed by Leeds Equity Partners LLC.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Covenant Review and Fulcrum Financial Data (“FFD”) are pleased to announce that Manish Aggarwal has joined as Head of New Product Development.
Covenant Review is known globally as The Authority on Bond and Loan Covenants. It began publishing research in 2006. Manish Aggarwal in 2005 co-founded Xtract Research, a covenant analysis platform, that was sold to MergerMarket in 2010, where he continued to work until the end of 2013.
Covenant Review Founder Adam Cohen praised Manish’s knowledge of the space: “I always admired Manish’s creative abilities as we competed against each other to create an entirely new category of covenant research. We fought to build businesses that would illuminate for investors the realities of their bond and loan contract rights. We are thrilled to have such an entrepreneur creating new products for fixed income professionals.”
Mr. Aggarwal said that he is “excited to be working with the Covenant Review team and build upon their leading covenant platform to offer additional value-added offerings to the fixed income market.” 





Fulcrum Financial Data is the combination of four entrepreneurial companies that are leading providers of research, news, and data analytics in the credit information space. FFD is headed by Steve Miller, the founder and former CEO of Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”), a subsidiary of S&P Global. Mr. Miller said, “FFD is an outstanding collection of four businesses still being run by the entrepreneurs that created them. Manish goes right to our DNA of continuing to innovate for the markets.”
The four FFD businesses are:
Covenant Review, (covenantreview.com), which provides bond indenture and loan agreement analysis on a subscription basis. Covenant Review is led by its founder, Adam Cohen, who first developed subscription research covenant products and is regarded as the preeminent thought leader in covenant analysis;
CapitalStructure, (capitalstructure.com), which is a leading source of timely, accurate news, analysis and data on the sub-investment grade debt markets. CapitalStructure is led by its founder, Minaxi Kesra;
LevFin Insights, (LevFinInsights.com), a subscription information service providing coverage of leveraged loan and high-yield bond markets. LevFin Insights was founded by the core former senior managers of Leveraged Commentary and Data: Marc Auerbach, Christopher Donnelly, Matthew Fuller, Kerry Kantin, and Robert Polenberg; and
PacerMonitor, (pacermonitor.com), is a unified, modern and full-featured platform for researching and tracking federal bankruptcy, district, and appellate court cases. PacerMonitor is headed by its founder Joe Rosen, who is a restructuring specialist. 





Fulcrum was assembled by Leeds Equity Partners, LLC acquiring leading providers in their space and retaining the founders to continue to drive those businesses. The creation of Fulcrum began with the acquisition of Covenant Review in 2014, which was followed by acquisitions of CapitalStructure and PacerMonitor in 2015. Subsequently, in April 2016, Steve Miller joined to spearhead the holding company with his experience both as an entrepreneur and as an operator of a larger organization in the credit markets. In September, Shasha Dai, formerly Special Writer of The Wall Street Journal, joined Fulcrum as the New York Bureau Chief of CapitalStructure.
