PreparedU: How Innovative Colleges Drive Student Success

Gloria C. Larson 
ISBN: 978-1-119-40239-8
288 pages
August 2017, Jossey-Bass



















Description
How can we as parents, educators, and members of the business community prepare students to be successful leaders in today's global environment? It's a critically important question. Gloria Cordes Larson, president of Bentley University, explains why today's practices in higher education are inadequate preparation for our rapidly evolving innovation economy.  Instead, she passionately advocates for a hybrid-learning model that integrates business education with traditional liberal arts courses. Today's businesses demand a new kind of hybrid graduate, possessed of both hard and soft skills, with the courage to take risks, the creativity to innovate, and the savvy to excel in a turbulent competitive climate. This book is a valuable resource for participants in every learning community: our homes, schools, and businesses. It will change the way you think about what excellence in education means in today's business environment as you develop strategies that will move our children, students, and future employees forward in a rapidly changing and very challenging world. Prepared with that training and knowledge, they will find greater fulfillment and make their own mark on the future.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
