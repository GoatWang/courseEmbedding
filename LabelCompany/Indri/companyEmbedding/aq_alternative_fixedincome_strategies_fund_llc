Risk
Please see the Fund's prospectus in the Literature section of the page for a description of risks associated with the Fund.

Performance
Performance data shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Class A: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class V: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class V: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at Net asset value (NAV). Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.
Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund’s most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund’s NAV.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.

Risk
Please see the Fund's prospectus in the Literature section of the page for a description of risks associated with the Fund.

Performance
Performance data shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Class A: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class V: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class V: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at Net asset value (NAV). Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.
Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund’s most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund’s NAV.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.

While many said they believed rates would eventually head upwards, not all managers were as proactive as Dr. Hasenstab about positioning their portfolios for the shift.

This video is not a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, market, industry, security or fund. Because market and economic conditions are subject to change, comments, opinions and analyses are rendered as of February 6, 2017, and may change without notice. A portfolio manager’s assessment of a particular security, investment or strategy is not intended as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy; it is intended only to provide insight into the fund’s portfolio selection process. Holdings are subject to change. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested.

The funds have a fee waiver associated with any investment they make in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through April 30, 2018. Fund investment results reflect the fee waiver; without this waiver, the results would have been lower.
The funds’ 30-day standardized yields are calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. The yields may not equal the funds’ actual income distribution rates, which reflects the funds’ past dividends paid to shareholders.

For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.

What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.

Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.



Latest edition



Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
US policy continues to be an important topic for investors throughout the world. Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Investors of

A&Q Alternative Fixed-Income Strategies Fund LLC 
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of A&Q Alternative Fixed-Income Strategies Fund LLC (the
�Fund�), including the schedule of portfolio investments, as of March�31, 2016, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the year ended March�31,
2016, the period from January�1, 2015 to March�31, 2015 and the year ended December�31, 2014, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund�s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund�s internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund�s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and
financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of investments in investment funds as of
March�31, 2016, by correspondence with management of the underlying investment funds or by other appropriate auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of A&Q Alternative Fixed-Income Strategies Fund LLC at March�31, 2016, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for the year ended March�31, 2016, the period from
January�1, 2015 to March�31, 2015 and the year ended December�31, 2014, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

A&Q Alternative Fixed-Income Strategies Fund LLC 
Notes to Financial Statements  �
� March�31, 2016 
� � �


1.
 Organization 
A&Q Alternative Fixed-Income Strategies Fund LLC (the �Fund�) was organized as a limited liability company under
the laws of Delaware on April�30, 2002 and commenced operations on August�1, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management
investment company. The Fund is commonly referred to as a �fund of funds.� Its investment objective is to maximize total return over the long term. The Fund will seek to achieve its objective principally through the allocation of assets
among a select group of alternative asset managers (the �Investment Managers�) and the funds they operate. Investment Managers generally conduct their investment programs through unregistered investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, that
have investors, other than the Fund, and in other registered investment companies (collectively, the �Investment Funds�). The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in Investment
Funds that employ primarily fixed-income strategies.  Effective January�1, 2015, the Fund changed its tax
classification from a partnership to a regulated investment company within the meaning of Section�851 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �RIC Conversion�). In connection with the RIC Conversion, the members of the
Fund collectively were issued 116,798.660 units of limited liability company interests of the Fund (the �Units�) at a net asset value (�NAV�) per Unit of $1,000, in exchange for their collective interests in the Fund as of
December�31, 2014, totaling $116,798,660 in net assets. In addition, the Fund changed its fiscal year-end from December�31 to March�31 and its tax year-end from December�31 to September�30. The Fund intends to qualify, and
will elect to be treated, as a regulated investment company (a �RIC�) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �Code�). 
Subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, the business and affairs of the Fund shall be managed under the direction of the
Fund�s Board of Directors (the �Board�, with an individual member referred to as a �Director�). The Board shall have the right, power and authority, on behalf of the Fund and in its name, to do all things necessary and
proper to carry out its duties under the Fund�s Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated from time to time. Each Director shall be vested with the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Fund as are
customarily vested in each director of a Delaware corporation, and each Director who is not an �interested person� (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund shall be vested with the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of
the Fund as are customarily vested in each director of a closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act that is organized as a Delaware corporation who is not an �interested person� of such company. No Director
shall have the authority individually to act on behalf of or to bind the Fund except within the scope of such Director�s authority as delegated by the Board. The Board may delegate the management of the Fund�s day-to-day operations to one
or more officers or other persons (including, without limitation, UBS Hedge Fund Solutions (as defined below)), subject to the investment objective and policies of the Fund and to the oversight of the Board.

 Organization (continued) 
The Board has engaged UBS Hedge Fund Solutions LLC (formerly UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC) (�UBS
Hedge Fund Solutions�, the �Adviser� and, when providing services under the Administration Agreement, the �Administrator�), a Delaware limited liability company, to provide investment advice regarding the selection of
Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. 
Units may be purchased as of the first business day of each month at the Fund�s then current NAV per Unit. The Fund from
time to time may offer to repurchase Units pursuant to written tenders by investors. These repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board in its complete and exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that
it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Units from investors as of the end of each calendar quarter. During the year ended March�31, 2016, 27,602.775 Units were repurchased.

 Significant Accounting Policies 
�


�
a.
 New Accounting Pronouncement 
During August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) released Accounting Standards Update 2014-15
Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) (�ASU 2014-15�). ASU 2014-15 requires the Adviser to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt
about the entity�s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable. ASU
2014-15 becomes effective for fiscal periods ending after December�15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The Adviser has elected not to early adopt ASU 2014-15 and is currently considering its effects upon the financial statements.
 �


�
b.
 Portfolio Valuation 
The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(�GAAP�), which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
The Fund uses NAV as its measure of fair value of an investment in an investee when (i)�the Fund�s investment does
not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii)�the NAV of the Investment Fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the underlying investments at
fair value. In evaluating the

 Portfolio Valuation (continued) 
level at which the fair value measurement of the Fund�s investments have been classified, the Fund has assessed factors
including, but not limited to, price transparency, the ability to redeem at NAV at the measurement date and the existence or absence of certain restrictions at the measurement date. 
In May 2015, the FASB issued an update on Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(�ASC 820�), ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (�ASU 2015-07�). Per ASU 2015-07, an investment within the scope of ASC 820, for which
fair value is measured using NAV as a practical expedient, should not be categorized within the fair value hierarchy. The update is required for fiscal periods beginning after December�15, 2015, however, earlier adoption is permitted. The
Adviser has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-07. Additional disclosures required by ASU 2015-07, including liquidity terms and conditions of the underlying investments, are included in the Schedule of Portfolio Investments. The total fair value of
the investments in Investment Funds valued using NAV as a practical expedient is $75,666,557.  The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:
 �








 Level�1�
��
 quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
��


 Level 2�
��
 inputs to the valuation methodology include quotes for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument
��
 ����

 Level 3�
��
 inputs to the valuation methodology include significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund�s own assumptions in
determining the fair value of investments)
��

 The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at the end of
the reporting period. There have been no transfers between levels during the reporting period.
 GAAP provides guidance in
determining whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides
guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and liabilities.
Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value measurements are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities requires greater
disaggregation than the Fund�s line items in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

 Portfolio Valuation (continued) 
The following is a summary of the investment strategies and any restrictions on the liquidity provisions of the investments in
Investment Funds held in the Fund as of March�31, 2016. Investment Funds with no current redemption restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions, in accordance with their offering documents. The Fund had
no unfunded capital commitments as of March�31, 2016. The Fund used the following categories to classify its Investment Funds: 
The Investment Funds in the credit/income strategy (total fair value of $38,171,746) utilize credit analysis to evaluate
potential investments and use debt or debt-linked instruments to execute their investment theses. Their approach can be either fundamental, quantitative, or a combination of both. As of March�31, 2016, the Investment Funds in the credit/income
strategy had $22,230,004, representing 58% of the value of the investments in this category, subject to investor level gates and/or lock-ups. Investments representing approximately 25% of the value of the investments in this category cannot be
redeemed because the investments include restrictions that do not allow for redemption in the first 12 months after acquisition without paying a fee. The remaining restriction period for these investments ranges from 3-9 months at March�31,
2016.  The other category (total fair value of $8,793,488) contains investment approaches that are outside of the
mainstream hedge fund strategies (credit/income, equity hedged, relative value and trading). The category includes other strategies, such as certain private equity and real estate dealings, as well as niche investment approaches including
asset-backed lending, insurance-linked securities, direct private lending, factoring, infrastructure investing, viatical/structured settlements, natural resources and weather derivatives. As of March�31, 2016, no Investment Funds in the other
strategy were subject to investor level gates or lock-ups. All investments in this category are held in side pockets or are in liquidation; therefore redemption notice periods are no longer effective and the liquidation of assets is uncertain. 
The Investment Funds in the relative value strategy (total fair value of $16,289,155), a broad category, generally encompass
strategies that are non-fundamental and non-directional, and often quantitatively driven. The Investment Funds in this strategy typically use arbitrage to exploit mispricing and other opportunities in various asset classes, geographies, and time
horizons. The Investment Funds frequently focus on capturing the spread between two assets, while maintaining neutrality to other factors, such as geography, changes in interest rates, equity market movement, and currencies, to name a few examples.
As of March�31, 2016, the Investment Funds in the relative value strategy had $12,156,297, representing 75% of the value of the investments in this category, subject to investor level gates and/or lock-ups. An investment representing
approximately 19% of

the value of the investments in this category cannot be redeemed because the investment includes a restriction that does not
allow for redemptions in the first 12 months after acquisition without paying a fee. The remaining restriction period for this investment is 8 months at March�31, 2016. 
The Investment Funds in the trading strategy (total fair value of $12,412,168) are generally top-down in nature and often
driven by econometric and macroeconomic research. These Investment Funds may utilize financial instruments, such as foreign exchange, equities, rates, sovereign debt, currencies, and commodities to express a manager�s view. In executing
different approaches, managers may use either fundamental or quantitative models or a combination of both. As of March�31, 2016, the Investment Funds in the trading strategy had $3,964,549, representing 32% of the value of the investments in
this category, subject to an investor level gate.  A detailed depiction of each investment in the portfolio by investment
strategy, including any additional liquidity terms and other restrictions, can be found in the Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

The NAV of the Fund is determined by the Fund�s administrator, under the oversight of the Adviser, as of the close of
business at the end of any fiscal period in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board. The Fund�s investments in Investment Funds are subject
to the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memorandums, as appropriate. The Adviser has adopted procedures pursuant to ASC 820 in which the Fund values its investments in Investment Funds at fair value. Fair
value is generally determined utilizing NAVs supplied by, or on behalf of, the Investment Funds� Investment Managers, which are net of management and incentive fees charged by the Investment Funds. NAVs received by, or on behalf of, the
Investment Funds� Investment Managers are based on the fair value of the Investment Funds� underlying investments in accordance with the policies established by the Investment Funds. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the
value of the Fund�s investments in the Investment Funds may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a ready market been available. See Schedule of Portfolio Investments for further information. 
The Fund considers foreign currency forward contracts to be Level 2 investments.

The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has
been estimated by the respective Investment Funds� management and is based upon available information in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values and does not

necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated
fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

It is unknown, on an aggregate basis, whether the Investment Funds held any investments whereby the Fund�s proportionate
share exceeded 5% of the Fund�s net assets at March�31, 2016.  The fair value of the Fund�s assets and
liabilities which qualify as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  �


�
c.
 Investment Transactions and Income Recognition 
The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair
value and cost of the underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis.

In 2008, the Fund�s former investment adviser, UBS Fund Advisor LLC, inaccurately allocated the costs of the insurance
premiums (the �premiums�) to the Fund. In analyzing the premiums for 2015, the Adviser concluded that the costs should have been allocated to both the Fund and the Adviser in proportions agreed to by both parties. The Board and the Adviser
agreed that the Fund should be repaid for the Adviser�s share of the premiums during the period from 2008-2014, with interest. Included in other income on the Statement of Operations is $190,087 from the repayment of this portion of the
premiums and interest by the Adviser. See Note 3 for additional related party transactions.  �


�
d.
 Fund Expenses 
The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses
related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Fund�s account; legal fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund�s NAV; costs of insurance; registration expenses; interest expense; offering and
organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications to investors; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors. Expenses are recorded on the
accrual basis.

e.
 Income Taxes 
For periods prior to January�1, 2015, the Fund, as a limited liability company, was classified as a partnership for
federal tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes was required.  Effective January�1, 2015,
the Fund elected to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, and it further intends to elect to be treated, and expects each year to qualify, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. For each taxable year that the Fund so
qualifies, the Fund will not be subject to federal income tax on that part of its taxable income that it distributes to its investors. Taxable income consists generally of net investment income and net capital gains. The Fund also intends to
distribute sufficient net investment income and net capital gains, if any, so that it will not be subject to excise tax on undistributed income and gains, resulting in no provision requirements for federal income or excise taxes. The Fund has a
September�30 tax year-end. Unless otherwise indicated, all applicable tax disclosures reflect tax adjusted balances at September�30, 2015. 
The Fund will file U.S. federal income and applicable state tax returns. The Adviser will analyze the Fund�s tax
positions and will determine if a tax provision for federal or state income tax is required in the Fund�s financial statements. The Fund�s federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years are subject to examination by the
Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. The Fund will recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. For the year ended March�31, 2016, the
Fund did not incur any interest or penalties. The Adviser does not believe there are positions for which it is reasonably likely that the total amounts of unrecognized tax liability will significantly change within twelve months of the reporting
date.  Permanent book-to-tax basis differences resulted in the reclassification of amounts stated below, between
accumulated net investment loss, accumulated net realized loss from investments and paid-in capital reported on the Fund�s Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of March�31, 2016. Such permanent reclassifications are attributable to
differences between book and tax reporting of the Fund�s investments which do not affect net assets or NAV per Share values.  �

 The tax character of distributions paid to shareholders during the financial statement year

 Under federal tax law, qualified late year ordinary and capital losses realized after December�31 and
October�31, respectively, may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. For the tax year ended September�30, 2015, the Fund incurred a late year ordinary loss of $1,608,488 which it will elect to
defer to the tax year ended September�30, 2016.  The federal tax cost of investments is adjusted
for taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment Funds. The aggregate tax cost of investments at March�31, 2016 is $86,699,828. Investment net tax basis unrealized depreciation was $11,033,271, consisting of $4,761,832 unrealized
appreciation and $15,795,103 unrealized depreciation.  The primary reason for differences between the earnings reported
above and the federal tax cost of investments, in comparison with the related amounts reported on the Fund�s Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of March�31, 2016, relates to cumulative differences between tax and GAAP financial
statement reporting requirements on the portfolio investments.  �


�
f.
 Cash 
Cash consists of monies held at The Bank of New York Mellon (the �Custodian�). Such cash, at times, may exceed
federally insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.  �


�
g.
 Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the uncertainty of valuation, such estimates may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.

 Related Party Transactions 
The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement. Pursuant to that
agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the �Investment Management Fee�) at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund�s net assets. 
The Administrator provides certain administrative services to the Fund, including, among other things, providing office space
and other support services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee (the �Management Fee�) at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Fund�s adjusted net assets determined as of the last day of each
month. Adjusted net assets as of any month-end date means the total value of all assets of the Fund, less an amount equal to all accrued debts, liabilities and obligations of the Fund as of such date, and calculated before giving effect to any
repurchase of Units on such date.  The Management Fee and Investment Management Fee are computed as of the start of
business on the last business day of the period to which each Management Fee and Investment Management Fee relates, after adjustment for any Unit purchases effective on such date, and will be payable in arrears. A portion of the Investment
Management Fee and the Management Fee is paid by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions to its affiliates.
 UBS Financial Services Inc.
(�UBS FSI�), a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if
any, charged on contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets of the Fund. 
Effective January�1, 2016, each Director of the Fund receives an annual retainer of $12,500 plus a fee for each meeting
attended. The Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board each receive an additional annual retainer in the amount of $20,000. These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis along
with the seven other registered alternative investment funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses. 
During the year ended March�31, 2016, the Fund paid a portion of the annual compensation of the Fund�s Chief
Compliance Officer in the amount of $17,242, which is included in Officers� and Directors� fees on the Statement of Operations. 
The Fund, along with other funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions, the Directors and the Adviser, is insured under an
insurance policy which protects against claims alleging a wrongful act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, and other items made in error. The annual premiums are allocated to the Adviser and to several UBS funds on a pro-rata basis
by members�

capital. On an annual basis, the Adviser determines the allocation to each fund, and the allocation is then approved by the
Board. During the year ended March�31, 2016, the Fund paid $40,509 in insurance fees.  The Fund, along with several
other funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions, is party to a Credit Agreement (see Note 6). On a quarterly basis, the credit provider will charge a fee (the �Commitment Fee�) on the unused portion of the total amount of the Credit
Agreement. The Adviser will negotiate the commitment amount with the counter party based on the amount each fund will be expected to borrow at a given time. The Commitment Fee will be allocated to each fund based on the expected borrowing amount
which is disclosed within the Credit Agreement. For the year ended March�31, 2016, the Fund incurred a Commitment Fee of $69,967 to the counter party, of which $18,200 was payable at March�31, 2016. 
Other investment partnerships sponsored by UBS AG or its affiliates may also maintain investment interests in the Investment
Funds owned by the Fund.
 �


4.
 Administration and Custody Fees 
BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (�BNY Mellon�), as Fund administrator, performs certain additional
administrative, accounting, record keeping, tax and investor services for the Fund. BNY Mellon receives a monthly fee primarily based upon (i)�the average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii)�the aggregate net
assets of the Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or advised by UBS AG, UBS Americas, Inc. or their affiliates. Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by BNY Mellon. 
The Custodian has entered into a service agreement whereby it provides custodial services for the Fund.

 Unit Capital and NAV 
The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Units. The Fund has registered $821,751,879 of Units for sale under its
Registration Statement (File No.�333-194092). The Units are being distributed by UBS Financial Services Inc. (together with any other broker or dealer appointed by the Fund as distributor of its Units, the �Distributor�). The
Distributor may pay from its own resources compensation to its financial advisers and brokers or dealers in connection with the sale and distribution of the Units or servicing of investors.

 Loan Payable 
The Fund, along with several other funds advised by UBS Hedge Fund Solutions, is party to a secured Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of September�1, 2015, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, which will terminate on August�30, 2016 unless extended (the �Credit Agreement�). Under the Credit Agreement, the
Fund may borrow from time to time on a revolving basis at any time up to $16,000,000 for temporary investment purposes and to meet requests for tenders. Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement accrues interest at a rate per annum for
each day equal to 1.5% plus the higher of the Overnight LIBOR Rate and the Federal Funds Rate for such day (the �Interest Rate�), or at 2% over the Interest Rate during an event of default. There is a Commitment Fee payable by the Fund,
calculated at 45 basis points per annum of the line of credit not utilized.  For the year ended March�31, 2016, the
Fund�s average interest rate paid on borrowings was 1.63%�per annum and the average borrowings outstanding was $186,667. The Fund did not have any borrowings outstanding at March�31, 2016. Interest expense for the year ended
March�31, 2016 was $3,051, of which none was payable at March�31, 2016.  �


7.
 Investments 
As of March�31, 2016, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of which were related parties. 
Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the year ended March�31, 2016 amounted to $21,722,190 and
$52,416,189, respectively.  The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the
general partners/managers in the form of management fees of 0.90% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and incentive fees or allocations ranging from 0.00% to 20.00% of net profits earned which excludes Highland Credit Strategies Fund, Ltd. that no
longer charges management or incentive fees. One or more Investment Funds have entered into a side pocket arrangement. Detailed information about the Investment Funds� portfolios is not available. Please see the Schedule of Portfolio

 Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter
into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts, contracts for differences, equity swaps, distressed investing, merger arbitrage and
convertible arbitrage. The Fund�s risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments. 
The Fund may enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract for the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency
at a fixed price on a future date as a hedge against either specific transactions or portfolio positions. The Fund may also purchase and sell forward contracts to seek to increase total return. All commitments are �marked-to-market� daily
at the applicable translation rates and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the Fund�s financial statements. The Fund records realized gains or losses at the time a forward contract is offset by entry into a closing
transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  The Fund entered into a forward foreign currency exchange contract to hedge
against a Euro denominated Investment Fund. The Fund enters into these contracts from time to time to mitigate the foreign currency risks associated with these types of investments.

The Fund is required to present enhanced information in order to provide users of financial statements with an improved degree
of transparency and understanding of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments are accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect an entity�s financial position, results of operations and its cash
flows. In order to provide such information to financial statement users, the Fund provides qualitative disclosures about an entity�s associated risk exposures, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of derivative instruments and the
gains and losses from derivative instruments.  The net realized loss and net change in unrealized depreciation on forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the year ended March�31, 2016 are $(12,580) and $(5,977), respectively, and are included in the net realized gain/(loss) from investments in Investment Funds and foreign currency contracts and
transactions and net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments in Investment Funds and foreign currency contracts and translations, respectively, on the Statement of Operations.

 Indemnification 
In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts or agreements that contain indemnifications or
warranties. Future events could occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, the Fund believes that the likelihood of such an event is remote.

�


10.
 Subsequent Events 
The Adviser has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through the date the financial statements were
available to be issued, and has determined that there were no events that required disclosure other than the following:

Subsequent to March�31, 2016, the Fund paid investors� redemptions payable of $6,231,594 in full on April�28,
2016.

1.
 General Policy

The general policy is to vote proxy proposals, amendments, consents or resolutions relating to client securities, including interests in private
investment funds, if any, (collectively, �proxies�), in a manner that serves the best interests of the clients managed by the Registrant, as determined by the Registrant in its discretion, taking into account relevant factors, including,
but not limited to:  �


-
 the impact on the value of the securities;



-
 the anticipated costs and benefits associated with the proposal;



-
 the effect on liquidity;



-
 impact on redemption or withdrawal rights;



-
 the continued or increased availability of portfolio information; and



-
 customary industry and business practices.

�


2.
 General Procedures

Unless clients have reserved voting rights to themselves, UBS Hedge Fund Solutions LLC (�HFS�) will direct the voting of proxies on securities
held in their accounts. However, since the holdings in client accounts of HFS are almost exclusively comprised of hedge funds, many of which have non-voting shares, HFS rarely votes proxies. When voting such proxies, HFS Operations Department will
consult with the HFS Investment Committee as well as the Legal and Compliance Department regarding the issues of the proxy vote. The Legal and Compliance Department will notify the Operations Department if there are any legal/compliance issues
related to the vote. If there are no such issues, the Investment Committee will instruct the Operations Department on how to vote the proxy. The Operations Department will notify the relevant external parties of those instructions and vote in proxy
in accordance to the instructions.  In the rare instance that HFS would have an equity security in one of its portfolios that holds a vote, HFS
Operations Department will consult with its affiliate, UBS O�Connor LLC (�O�Connor�) on how to vote such proxy. In this instance, HFS would follow O�Connor�s Proxy Voting Policy and vote its proxy in accordance to the
guidance provided by O�Connor�s Proxy Voting Policy (a copy of which is attached).  HFS has implemented procedures designed to identify
whether HFS has a conflict of interest in voting a particular proxy proposal, which may arise as a result of its or its affiliates� client relationships, marketing efforts or banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. To address
such conflicts, HFS has imposed information barriers between it and its affiliates who conduct banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. Whenever HFS is aware of a conflict with respect to a particular proxy as determined by the
Legal and Compliance Department, such proxy will be reviewed by a group consisting of members from the Operations Department, Investment Committee and Legal and Compliance and the group is required to review and agree to the manner in which such
proxy is voted.  �


2.1
 Recordkeeping 
A record of all votes cast must be maintained in order to permit the SEC registered funds to file timely and accurately Form N-PX and to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements of IA Act rule 204-2(e)(1). Additionally the Adviser shall maintain a written record of the method used to resolve a material conflict of interest.

Item�8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies. 
A&Q ALTERNATIVE FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIES FUND LLC 
PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE
 The
Fund is managed by a portfolio management team that is jointly and primarily responsible for the selection of the Fund�s investments, the allocation of the Fund�s assets among underlying investment managers and the general day-to-day
management of the Fund.�The members of the portfolio management team are Bruce Amlicke, Americo Nardis, Russell Sinder and Joseph M. Sciortino (each, a �Portfolio Manager� and collectively, the �Portfolio Managers�). 
Messrs. Amlicke and Nardis have served as Portfolio Managers of the Fund since 2013.�Mr. Amlicke is a Managing Director and the Co-Chief
Investment Officer of UBS Hedge Fund Solutions LLC (the �Adviser� or �UBS HFS�).�He also is the Co-Chairman of UBS HFS� Investment Committee.�Prior to re-joining UBS in 2010, Mr. Amlicke served as Chief Investment
Officer of Blackstone Alternative Asset Management and Senior Managing Director of The Blackstone Group LP.�From 2003 to 2004, he was Chief Investment Officer of the O�Connor Multi-Manager Program, the predecessor of UBS HFS.�Mr.
Nardis is a Managing Director and the Deputy Chief Investment Officer of UBS HFS.�He also is the Co-Chairman of UBS HFS� Investment Committee.�Mr. Nardis joined UBS in 2001, as a Senior Investment Officer for the O�Connor
Multi-Manager Program.�From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Nardis worked in the Manager Research Department at Tremont Advisers, Inc. as a Primary Specialist in Long/Short Equity.�Mr. Sinder has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its
inception.�He was associated with UBS Alternative Investments US from 1998 to 2010 and is an Executive Director of UBS HFS.�Mr. Sciortino joined the portfolio management team in 2006.�Mr. Sciortino was associated with UBS Alternative
Investments US from December 2006 to October 2010 and is a Director of UBS HFS.�Previously, he served as Senior Analyst at Lake Partners, Inc. from April 2001 through August 2006. 
The Fund�s Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser, including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and
offshore pooled investment vehicles.  Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers� management of the
Fund and other accounts.�For example, conflicts of interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of limited investment opportunities.�Allocations of investment opportunities generally could raise a
potential conflict of interest to the extent that the Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are expected to increase in value to preferred accounts.�Conversely, a Portfolio Manager could favor one account over
another in the amount or the sequence in which orders to redeem investments are placed.�The Portfolio Managers may be perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are
managing on behalf of the Adviser.�In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an investment in accounts other than the Fund.�A potential
conflict of interest may also arise if the Adviser receives a performance-based advisory fee from one account but not another because a Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether or not the performance of that
account directly determines the Portfolio Manager�s compensation.�The Adviser periodically reviews the Portfolio Managers� overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to allocate the necessary time and resources to
effectively manage the Fund.  Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ from those of the
Fund.�For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance of the investments
purchased for other accounts.�The Portfolio Managers may place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the potential to adversely impact the
Fund, depending on market conditions.  The Adviser�s goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its clients, while
meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly.�The Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the conflicts associated
with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients.�In addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with Fund guidelines.�Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel at the Adviser periodically review
the performance of the Portfolio Managers.  The Portfolio Managers� compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary and a
discretionary bonus paid by the Adviser or its affiliates and not by the Fund.�A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of funds managed by the Adviser or in shares of stock or stock options of UBS AG, the parent company of
the Adviser, subject to certain vesting periods.�The amount of a Portfolio Manager�s discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares of funds managed by the Adviser or in shares of stock or stock options of UBS AG, is determined
by senior officers of the Adviser.�In general, the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which is necessarily weighted more than any other factor.�These factors may include: the overall performance of the
Adviser;�the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to the Adviser derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed by the Adviser; the absolute performance of the Fund and such other accounts for the preceding
year;�contributions by the Portfolio Manager to assisting in managing the Adviser; participation by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio Manager generally to colleagues.�The bonus is not based on a
precise formula, benchmark or other metric.  The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the Fund�s
Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those accounts as of March 31, 2016.

Risk
Please see the Fund's prospectus in the Literature section of the page for a description of risks associated with the Fund.

Performance
Performance data shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Class A: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class V: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class V: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at Net asset value (NAV). Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund’s most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund’s NAV.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.

Risk
Please see the Fund's prospectus in the Literature section of the page for a description of risks associated with the Fund.

Performance
Performance data shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Class A: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class V: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class V: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at Net asset value (NAV). Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Actively Prepared for Rising Rates








While many said they believed rates would eventually head upwards, not all managers were as proactive as Dr. Hasenstab about positioning their portfolios for the shift. Hear his thoughts on the impact government policy could have on inflation, economic growth and interest rates moving forward.

This video is not a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, market, industry, security or fund. Because market and economic conditions are subject to change, comments, opinions and analyses are rendered as of February 6, 2017, and may change without notice. A portfolio manager’s assessment of a particular security, investment or strategy is not intended as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy; it is intended only to provide insight into the fund’s portfolio selection process. Holdings are subject to change. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested.
1. Source: FactSet Research, Morningstar. March 31, 2017. Indexes are unmanaged, and one cannot invest directly in an index. They do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. Important data provider notices and terms are available at www.franklintempletondatasources.com.
The funds have a fee waiver associated with any investment they make in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through April 30, 2018. Fund investment results reflect the fee waiver; without this waiver, the results would have been lower.
The funds’ 30-day standardized yields are calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. The yields may not equal the funds’ actual income distribution rates, which reflects the funds’ past dividends paid to shareholders.
The funds offer multiple share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses that will affect their performance. Visit the fund information page for performance and fee details for other share classes: Templeton Global Bond Fund / Templeton Global Total Return Fund.
Effective 1/1/97, Templeton Global Bond Fund began offering Advisor Class shares. For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.
Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a market-capitalization weighted index representing the U.S. investment-grade fixed rate taxable bond market.
Citigroup World Government Bond Index is a market capitalization weighted index consisting of investment-grade world government bond markets.
Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse Index provides a broad-based measure of the global fixed-income bond market. The index represents the union of the Global Aggregate Index and the Global High-Yield Index and captures investment-grade and high-yield securities in all eligible currencies.
What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.
Templeton Global Total Return Fund

The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.

Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
US policy continues to be an important topic for investors throughout the world. Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
