GEORGE D. LAWRENCE, 66, joined the company’s board of directors in May 1996. He is a member of the Audit Committee.
From 1990 until May 1996, Lawrence was president, chief executive officer, and a director of The Phoenix Resource Companies, Inc., an international publicly-owned oil and gas company that merged with Apache in 1996.
In 1985, Lawrence began his oil and gas career with the predecessor to Phoenix, holding management positions with increasing responsibility, culminating in his appointment as president and chief executive officer and his service as a director until the Phoenix and Apache merger.
Since retiring from Phoenix, Lawrence has been a private investor.
Prior to entering the oil and gas business, Lawrence served in the Environmental Enforcement Section of the United States Department of Justice, his last position there being assistant chief.
During his tenure as president and chief executive officer of Phoenix, Lawrence gained valuable corporate leadership experience in all aspects of business, including finance, securities, operations, strategy and risk.
At Phoenix and its predecessor, Lawrence was extensively involved in international operations spread over several continents, and he was especially instrumental in leading Phoenix’s operations in Egypt, an area that remains important to Apache’s operations.
His dedication to environmental responsibility stemming from his service in the Department of Justice Environmental Enforcement Section continues to this day.

The George Lawrence Company History



Portland, Oregon 1857 - 1985

The History of the George Lawrence Company begins as the Samuel Sherlock Company this history is long and 
complicated originating in 1857 with three men in the newly formed City of Portland, Oregon.  These men were 
Samuel Sherlock, William Sherlock, Charles P. Bacon (George W. Lawrence the fourth man comes later) the original 
founders of what would eventually become known as The George Lawrence Company of Portland, Oregon.  We will try 
to cover each of these individual's histories and how they came together to the ultimate forming of one of the 
Old West Saddle and Sporting Good Leather Manufacturers including a Full line of Gun Leather.
Charles P. Bacon

The History of Charles P. Bacon starts in Candor, Tioga County, New York on April 15, 1823 and at 18 years old he 
moved to Coldwater, Michigan with his Parents Dr. and Mrs. William Bacon.  Just as a side note Dr. and Mrs. William 
Bacon remained married for more than 70 years with both having lived into their 90s living in Michigan their entire 
lives.  In 1847 Charles P. Bacon moved to Illinois and it is believed at this time he learned the Livery and 
Harness Making Businesses.  Again in 1850 Charles P. Bacon relocated once across the plains and without documented 
incident with Indians he arrived in the newly developing City of Portland, Oregon which at this time was a one 
street City Front Street.  After short lived employment at various jobs he went into Partnership with William 
Sherlock who had arrived in Portland at the same time as Charles P. Bacon they started businesses in a Livery 
Stable and Draying or Hauling Materials Businesses in the growing City of Portland, Oregon.  On January 17, 1855 
Charles P. Bacon was married to Clara A. Clark formerly from Warren, Maine they were married in Portland, Oregon 
and they had 2 Children both Daughters. In 1857 through an interest in Saddlery and Harness Making Charles P. 
Bacon went into Business with Samuel Sherlock as his Primary Working Partner and William Sherlock as an Investing 
Partner they opened the original George Lawrence Company Saddlery on Front Street in Portland, Oregon although in 
1857 it was named differently.  The Business Partnership thrived for Twenty One Years although in 1878 Charles P. 
Bacon and William Sherlock both left the Saddlery Business.  The 3rd Partner in the Business Samuel Sherlock was 
killed after being thrown from his horse on July 15, 1876 this is what brought about the changes in ownership.  The 
next endeavor for Charles P. Bacon was the Blackhawk Stables located on Second Street between Stark and Oak in the 
now growing Portland, Oregon.  As well as maintaining his business interests, Charles P. Bacon was active in civic 
matters although maintaining his Republican status he never sought Public Office.  In Civic matters Charles P. 
Bacon was the County Assessor in 1854 he was also active in the Volunteer Fire Department and in 1856 he was the 
County Tax Collector.
William Sherlock

The beginnings for William Sherlock were humble having been born in County Wexford, Ireland to John and Dorotha 
Sherlock on December 25, 1817 with little more actually being known of his early years other then he received a 
formal education from an early age.  In 1846 in Wexford, Ireland William Sherlock married Miss Dolly Pounder 
Sherlock with whom he had 11 children 6 Daughters and 5 Sons.  In 1848 William and his wife Dolly Sherlock 
immigrated to the United States arriving at New York City, NY in later 1848 where they remained for a short time 
acclimating to their new country.  In early 1850, William Sherlock relocated his Wife and now 2 Children once again 
across the Great Plains to Portland, Oregon arriving in Portland on March 4, 1850 at the same time as C. P. Bacon 
although arriving separately by different means.  At this time in 1850, William Sherlock's younger brother Samuel 
Sherlock was just leaving Ireland to make the same journey William Sherlock made in 1848 with the ultimate 
destination to be Portland, Oregon.  Upon arriving to Portland, it appears that William Sherlock and Charles P. 
Bacon became business partners. Shortly after their arrivals in Portland, they started a Livery Stable and Draying 
or Hauling Business, which Horses had long been a passion of C. P. Bacon Livery and Harness making were his means 
of making a living.  In 1857 through an interest in Saddlery and Harness Making Charles P. Bacon went into business 
with Samuel Sherlock as his Primary Working Partner and William Sherlock as an Investing Partner they opened the 
original George Lawrence Company Saddlery on Front Street in Portland, Oregon although in 1857 it was named The 
Samuel Sherlock Company until 1876.  The Partnership between William Sherlock, Samuel Sherlock and Charles P. 
Bacon lasted until 1876 when William Sherlock's brother and partner, Samuel Sherlock, died after being thrown from 
his horse on July 15, 1876. It was at this time that all four men who were involved in this business divided the 
business and the assets including many Real Estate Holdings.  The next endeavor for Charles P. Bacon was the 
Blackhawk Stables located on Second Street between Stark and Oak in the growing Portland, Oregon.  The year of 
1876 proved to be very eventful for William Sherlock with his eldest daughter Dorothea married on April 27, 1876. 
Also previously stated, on July 15, 1876, his brother and Business Partner Samuel Sherlock died after being thrown 
from his horse. Last, but most important, William Sherlock's wife, Polly Pounder Sherlock, died as well. The 
details of how and the exact date she died I have not found.

At this time, as part of his compensation when dividing the assets of their business, William Sherlock in part took 
a 40 Acre Parcel of land which he developed in the later 1870s and early 1880s. That parcel was divided and 
developed into what is known as Sherlock Addition in Portland, Oregon and through Real Estate Investing, Banking 
and The Blackhawk Livery Stables is how William Sherlock made his fortune.  After the passing of Polly Sherlock 
there was still 8 Children in the Sherlock household 1 had married in April of 1876 and 2 of the boys had died from 
earlier incidents that I am unclear about at this time.  By the end of 1876 with many of the outside business 
affairs of William Sherlock were settled and he became a work from home father who spent majority of his time 
raising his family and tending his Real Estate Investments. The most famous of these investments was The Sherlock 
Building at 309 SW 3rd Avenue Portland, Oregon which having been built in 1892 it is currently listed on The 
National Register of Historical Places.  On March 22, 1901 William Sherlock went for his morning buggy ride with 
one of his daughters as he had done every day for many years. Upon arriving back home, he complained of not feeling 
well and went for a nap. Although he did awake from his nap within a short time, he died while still resting in his 
home.
Samuel Sherlock

The history for Samuel Sherlock very much parallels the history of his Brother William Sherlock as the two shared 
many of the adventures in life separately but together as I will show through the following.  The birth of Samuel 
Sherlock took place in County Wexford, Ireland approximately 1820 to John and Dorotha Sherlock.  The early 
education that Samuel Sherlock received was at the Erasmus Smith Foundation School and that is where he learned 
leather work and Saddle & Harness Making which would later become his career.  It was the Stories of the 
opportunities available in this Country relayed to Samuel Sherlock in Ireland from his Brother William Sherlock in 
Portland, Oregon that brought Samuel Sherlock and his young wife to this to this Country in 1851.  Upon arriving in 
the United States Samuel Sherlock went to work for a time in New Haven, Connecticut also in Newark, New Jersey and 
he stayed on the East Coast for a total of 6 years both times as a saddle maker for existing businesses in those 
cities. The reason appears to be Samuel Sherlock's wife was giving birth to their first child after they arrived in 
the United States making that child the first born in the United States and the first Sherlock Child Citizen of 
this Country.  In late 1856 Samuel Sherlock packed up his Wife and his two Children and they moved to Oregon 
traveling by water route through the Isthmus of Panama and arriving in Portland, Oregon in 1857.  Upon his arrival to Portland, Oregon which was coming with great expectation Samuel Sherwood went to work for his Brother and C. P. Bacon in their Livery and Draying Business and he was commissioned to make to Side Saddles for which he was paid a good sum.  In mid 1857 Samuel Sherlock, C. P. Bacon and William Sherlock entered into a business partnership calling their business The Samuel Sherlock Company located at 55 Front Street.  In this Partnership Samuel Sherlock provided the Saddlery Business Craftsmanship and know how William Sherlock provided financial and business backing while C. P. Bacon provided financial backing and a love of horses while owning the Livery with William Bacon which meant a lot of 
business to the Saddlery.  This Partnership was a very successful Partnership and lasted for 21 years with the 
business becoming busy enough that Samuel Sherlock guaranteed a job to his and William Sherlock’ Brother in law 
who wanted to come to Portland, Oregon and leave Ireland as did Samuel and William.  The Brother in law was George 
W. Lawrence who on August 13, 1861 married Samuel and William Sherlock's Sister Rose D. Sherlock in County Wexford, 
Ireland and by trade George W. Lawrence was a Saddle & Harness Maker.  When these arrangements for work and 
relocating were in place George W. Lawrence and his wife sailed across the Ocean and arrived in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania in late 1873 where they remained as a guest of many friends for a short time before moving to 
Portland, Oregon.  On February 8, 1874 George W. Lawrence and his wife Rose Sherlock Lawrence arrived in Portland, 
Oregon where her Brothers Samuel Sherlock and William Sherlock had been awaiting the arrival of their family.  
Upon arrival in Portland, Oregon George W. Lawrence went right to work for The Samuel Sherlock Company and this 
gave the business to expand in size because of the additional work which could be produced.
 Unfortunately on July 
15, 1876 while riding his horse on his daily ride, Samuel Sherlock was thrown from his horse sustaining serious 
enough injuries that he died as the ultimate result of the incident.  After the other 2 Partners C. P. Bacon and 
William Sherlock settled their interests in the Samuel Sherlock Company George W. Lawrence came to an agreement 
where he continued to run the business for the widow and Sons of Samuel Sherlock.  This arrangement continued until 
1892 when George Lawrence purchased the interests in the business from Samuel Sherlock's Widow.  In 1893, with the 
minor financial interests of his three sons, (George Jr., John and William) George W. Lawrence Sr. changed the name 
to The George Lawrence Company and Incorporated the business in that same year 1893. 
George W. Lawrence Sr.

The beginnings for George Walter Lawrence started in County Wexford, Ireland on May 14, 1832 and at an early age 
of nine, in 1841, his Father died leaving a Widow and five Children.  After this tragedy Mrs. Lawrence maintained her 
home of 5 Children by keeping store for a local merchant where through hers and the family efforts they were able 
to prosper and properly educate all 5 Children.  It was at the store where George W. Lawrence's Mother presided 
that George W. Lawrence received his early introduction to running a business and at the age of Fourteen years old, 
and in 1846 George W. Lawrence took an apprenticeship to learn Saddlery & Harness Making from James Davis a 
Saddlery & Dry Goods Dealer in Drogheda, Ireland.  It was at this time that George W. Lawrence truly honed his 
business skills in learning not only Leather Work but Marketing and the Dry Goods Business.  It was approximately 
10 years that George W. Lawrence stayed in the employ of James David until 1857 when he moved to Dublin, Ireland 
where he continued in the employ of a Department Store in Dublin as a Buyer.

On August 2, 1861, Georgw W. Lawrence Sr. was married to Rosetta D. Sherlock in Dublin, Ireland their first Son 
George A. Lawrence Jr. was born in Ireland also in 1863. The Lawrence's had 6 Children all told: George Lawrence 
Jr., John A. Lawrence, William C. Lawrence, also 2 Girls Sophia and Mabel. The 6th Child had died and I have not 
found the name or cause.  It was until 1870 that George W. Lawrence stayed employed at the department in Dublin at 
that time he found himself unemployed due to an ownership change.  Over the next 7 years George W. Lawrence made 
his living supplying goods in small lots on jobbing terms to businesses of his acquaintance from the previous 13 
years. The business opportunities in Dublin were becoming difficult at best and through word from his Brothers in 
law William and Samuel Sherlock arrangements were made for George W. Lawrence and his family to relocate to 
Portland, Oregon with a guarantee of work from Samuel Shelock to work at his and William Sherlock's Saddlery &
Harness Business.  In 1874 George W. Lawrence came to Portland, Oregon to join both of his brothers in law, Samuel
Sherlock and William.  Although a Dry Goods man by training with his 13 years experience in Ireland, he tackled and
mastered every job that came along in Saddlery & Harness Business and was fully prepared to take charge of the
business when Samuel Sherlock died two years later on July 15, 1876.  Unfortunately on July 15, 1876 while riding
his horse on his daily ride, Samuel Sherlock was thrown from his horse sustaining serious enough injuries that he
died as the ultimate result of the incident.

After 2 of the remaining Partners C. P. Bacon and William Sherlock settled their interests in the Samuel Sherlock
Company George W. Lawrence came to an agreement where he continued to run the business in the capacity of a manager
for the Widow and Sons of Samuel Sherlock.  This arrangement continued until 1892 when George Lawrence purchased
the interests in the business from Samuel Sherlock's Widow.  In April 1893, at the age of sixty-one, and in the
face of one of the nation's worst panics, Mr. Lawrence secured additional capital and with his own savings and those of his sons and daughters, bought The Samuel Sherlock Company renamed and incorporated the business as The
George Lawrence Company.  In 1893 When the Lawrence Family purchased the business it was located in Portland, Oregon in a brick building which was 25 x 100 and two stories high and the Company maintained 12 full time
employees.  By 1905, the Company had built a large building starting it in 1903 at SW 1st and Oaks Street in
Portland, Oregon for itself, covering one-quarter block at 100 x 100 and four stories high offering 60,000 Square
Feet of working space. The layout of the building was Offices, Showrooms and Shipping on the Lowest Floor, Stock
Rooms and Sample Rooms, Third Floor was Saddle Makers and the Fourth Floor was Harness Equipment for both Farming
and Draft Horses. The Family maintained their home at 752 Flanders Street in Portland, Oregon.  The wife of George
W. Lawrence, Mrs. Rosetta D. Sherlock Lawrence died on March 2, 1918 and on December 14, 1923 George W. Lawrence
Sr. Died, his Son George A. Lawrence Jr. who was a consultant and advisor to his father, was elected to the 
Presidency of the Company.

The George Lawrence Company Saddle, Harness and Sporting Goods Factory employed over 250 mechanics through World 
War I.  After World War I The George Lawrence Company expanded into the following Industries Importers & 
Jobbers of Shoe Findings, Shoe Store Supplies, Automotive Supplies starting in March of 1923, Saddlery, Harness 
Hardware, Leather Suitcases Trunks and Bags.  Also in the early 1900s The Lawrence George Lawrence Company also 
entered into the Leather Sporting Goods Business Gun Leather, Cowboy Accessories Chaps, Shooters Cuffs, Fishing 
Creels etc.  As of 1925 all three of George W. Lawrence's Sons work for the business George Lawrence Jr. President, 
George A. Lawrence (Grandson) Vice President, William C. Lawrence Treasurer & Secretary, John A. Lawrence 
worked for the Company but was not listed among the Corporate Officers.  After many years of stable growth 
throughout the first half of the Twentieth Century the second half of the Twentieth Century was far less kind 
especially after World War II where the need for Saddlery & Harness Goods declined drastically, as did the need 
for Gun Leather and some of the other staple products for the Company.
In 1985, all divisions of The George 
Lawrence Company except the leather goods manufacturing were divested and the manufacturing operation was moved.  
The Lawrence family sold the building built by George W. Lawrence in 1903 at SW 1st and Oaks Street in Portland, 
Oregon. It has been renovated on the inside and converted to a commercial building.  In 1989, the leather goods 
business was sold to Gould & Goodrich Leather, Inc. and moved to Lillington, North Carolina. Now, under the 
name of Lawrence Leather Company, Jim Buffaloe is the sole craftsman carrying on the Lawrence tradition.
  
The current motto is - "When you own Lawrence Leather, you own a legend."
