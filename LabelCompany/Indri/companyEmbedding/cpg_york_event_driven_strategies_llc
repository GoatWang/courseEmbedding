The Boston Company Asset Management Launches MLP and Event-Driven Alternative Strategies for Institutional Investors

		  Pine Cobble Capital Founders Bring Expertise to BNY Mellon Investment Boutique

NEW YORK, Dec. 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Boston Company Asset Management, LLC (TBCAM), a Boston-based BNY Mellon boutique that invests in active equity, has launched two new strategies for institutional investors – an energy infrastructure strategy that utilizes master limited partnerships (MLPs) and an event-driven absolute return strategy.  To manage these offerings, TBCAM has brought on an experienced team that founded and managed Pine Cobble Capital, LLC, along with their existing strategies and assets.    
The energy infrastructure strategy invests primarily in companies that own and operate midstream assets, such as pipelines, terminals and processing facilities, which have long useful lives and offer attractive rates of return. The strategy focuses on generating total returns through a combination of current yield, distribution growth, and the identification of catalysts that could affect cash flow and market perception. This strategy invests in MLPs, corporations that control MLPs or midstream assets, and other companies influenced by developments in U.S. energy infrastructure.
The event-driven strategy invests in a concentrated number of long and short positions with potential value drivers such as financial or corporate structure changes, operational restructurings, mergers and acquisitions or special situations.  This strategy is focused primarily on U.S. small and mid-capitalization equities and also opportunistically invests across the capital structure in corporate credit securities.  
Bart Grenier, chief executive officer and chief investment officer for TBCAM, said, "The launch of these two strategies significantly strengthens our alternative investment capabilities at a time when institutional investors are increasingly looking for new investment options. We believe the energy infrastructure sector presents a compelling opportunity for a catalyst-driven, total return approach due to the combination of attractive current yield, strong distribution growth potential, and a dynamic industry environment. Moreover, the bottom-up, value-oriented process employed by the event-driven strategy is a good fit with The Boston Company's fundamental approach."
The two strategies are managed by Robert A. Nicholson and Zev D. Nijensohn, who joined TBCAM in November, 2014, as senior managing directors and senior portfolio managers from Pine Cobble Capital LLC, which they co-founded in 2007.  The team will continue to take the same approach it utilized at Pine Cobble and has transitioned the strategies and assets it managed to TBCAM. 
Prior to co-founding Pine Cobble, Nicholson served as a managing director and general partner at Spectrum Equity Investors, a private equity firm focused on media, communications, business and consumer services, and technology. Previously, he was a consultant at Bain & Company. Nicholson received his bachelor's degree with honors in economics from Williams College and an MBA with high distinction from Harvard Business School.
Nijensohn was previously a senior analyst at Empyrean Capital LP, a multi-strategy event-driven hedge fund, where he covered telecom, media, financial services and business services. He also was a research analyst at Shumway Capital, a principal at Spectrum Equity Investors, and a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Robertson Stephens. Nijensohn holds an AB in history from Dartmouth College.
"Fundamental analysis is core to what we do, and it's also at the core of The Boston Company," said Nicholson.  "We look forward to contributing our knowledge and experience and believe TBCAM's platform enhances our ability to deliver attractive returns to a broader client base," Nijensohn added.  
The Boston Company Asset Management, LLC, a BNY Mellon Investment Management boutique, provides active equity investment-management services for corporate, public, mutual funds and union sponsored and jointly trusteed retirement plans, endowments and foundations.  Assets are managed by The Boston Company as well as its personnel acting as dual officers of either The Dreyfus Corporation or The Bank of New York Mellon.

Our Strategies
Focusing on events rather than markets, Water Island Capital takes an opportunistic and flexible approach to event-driven opportunities around the globe.

Event-driven investing is a highly specialized strategy designed to profit from the behavior of equity and debt instruments trading within the timelines of specific corporate events, such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, refinancings, recapitalizations, and distressed situations. In seeking to capture low-correlated absolute returns, Water Island Capital does not invest based on market fundamentals, but rather on event fundamentals.
When partnering with Water Island Capital, investors have access to global event-driven investing, including single-strategy and multi-strategy approaches in both fixed income and equities.


MERGER ARBITRAGE »



Seeking to profit from the successful completion of corporate reorganizations, Merger Arbitrage pursues absolute returns with low correlation. Water Island Capital’s approach may utilize both the equity and credit securities of firms involved in announced transactions, along with hedging strategies designed to minimize market exposure and volatility.





EQUITY SPECIAL SITUATIONS »



Equity Special Situations employs an event-driven investment focus around a wide range of opportunities such as spin-offs, restructurings, syndicates, and pre-arbitrage situations. We look for equity securities that we believe are significantly mispriced and offer an attractive risk/reward opportunity. At the same time, we implement hedging techniques to minimize volatility and to isolate the alpha opportunity associated with the corporate event.





CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES »



Our Credit Opportunities strategy pursues a non-traditional, catalyst-driven approach to fixed income investing. This unconstrained, alternative credit strategy focuses on a broad range of catalysts and events such as mergers, refinancings, deep value credit, and regulatory changes. We hold both long and short investments, and may employ convertible arbitrage, merger arbitrage, or capital structure arbitrage techniques in order to exploit security mispricings or inefficiencies, while seeking to limit credit and interest rate risk.





EVENT-DRIVEN »



Our Event-Driven strategy invests in opportunities where the return potential is more correlated to the outcomes of specific catalysts and events rather than to overall market direction. We implement our strategy via an optimized, blended approach to our three core investment capabilities. We adopt a flexible and cycle agnostic approach because different markets offer different opportunities.

What is an 'Event Driven Strategy'
An event driven strategy is a strategy, adopted by hedge fund managers, that attempts to take advantage of events such as mergers and restructurings that can result in the short-term mispricing of a company's stock. An event-driven strategy focuses on exploiting the tendency of the equities of companies in a time of change to drop in price. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Event Driven Strategy'
Investors often become concerned when a company is going through a corporate reorganization, restructuring, merger, acquisition or other major event. This can lead the stock price to stagnate until investors feel comfortable with its stability again. When a hedge fund manager or other event-driven strategist finds a potential investment, he or she will examine the underlying value of the company and the situation surrounding the event, including potential regulatory pitfalls. If he or she feels positive about the event and the strength of the company, he or she may buy shares to sell later when the price adjusts.

Event-Driven Strategies


    By Investopedia Staff 






Share



















































Event-driven strategies take advantage of transaction announcements and other one-time events. One example is merger arbitrage, which is used in the event of an acquisition announcement and involves buying the stock of the target company and hedging the purchase by selling short the stock of the acquiring company. Usually at announcement, the purchase price that the acquiring company will pay to buy its target, exceeds the current trading price of the target company. The merger arbitrageur bets the acquisition will happen and cause the target company's price to converge (rise) to the purchase price that the acquiring company pays. This also is not pure arbitrage. If the market happens to frown on the deal, the acquisition may unravel and send the stock of the acquirer up (in relief) and the target company's stock down (wiping out the temporary bump), which would cause a loss for the position. There are various types of event-driven strategies. One other example is "distressed securities," which involves investing in companies that are reorganizing or have been unfairly beaten down. Another interesting type of event-driven fund is the activist fund, which is predatory in nature. This type takes sizable positions in small, flawed companies and then uses its ownership to force management changes or a restructuring of the balance sheet.Related Readings:Hedge Funds Hunt For Upside, Regardless Of The Market

Why Is Trade Promotion Spending Increasing? By Al HellerThe store-brand surge in the recession prompted CPG to respond with heftier trade promotion spends — up three straight years into 2010 to a lofty 17% of CPG sales.  Looking ahead, these private label gains will cause trade promotion to “continue to play the largest role in the marketing mix, representing over 50% of all spending,” predicts Donald Stuart, COO, Kantar Retail.“If you also include the shopper marketing expenditure, it represents more than 60% of the marketing dollars.  Thus, $6 of every $10 are channeled through the retailer.  The retailer owns the Khyber Pass and all manufacturers must pass through,” he adds.Other experts agree trade spend has risen, but cite different reasons beyond private label.  The rise “has been driven as much by consumer focus on price value given the tough economy, more so than private label increases,” says Paul Thompson, Managing Director, Henry Rak Consulting Partners. “In fact, 60% of categories in the center store had an increase in ‘price only’ support, according to the 2010 IRI Merchandising Trends Report.  In brand-driven categories (such as cereal, with a 10% private label share), CPG companies are less likely to over-promote to compete with private label.  However, in product-driven categories (such as milk, with a 63% PL share), CPG fights to drive share through price.”Since CPG companies feel private-label issues aren’t controllable, CPG “looks the other way,“ observes Jim Hertel, Managing Partner, Willard Bishop.  “So they aren’t viewing private label as the threat it was when we saw such inflation in 2007-early 2008. I think companies are spending relative to their own objectives and not specifically with private label in mind.  If inflation continues to worsen, and consumers resume trading down in price as they did before, I suspect CPG trade promotion spending will rise again.”Indeed, commodity price hikes are raising product costs and retail prices in 2011. If trade promotion spending does rise, as Hertel suggests, it would resume its long-term ascent following a recent respite where spending abated to 16.4% of CPG sales.  Stuart cites several reasons for this downtick:  a slow strengthening of the economy and partial return to traditional brand-buying habits, and a sales shift to everyday low price outlets where trade spend may not be captured.With price volatility in the picture today, and retailers motivated to push store brands because of their exclusivity and high margins, CPG should trade-promote to effectively manage the price gaps between their brands and private label.  “Most CPG companies understand their trade efficiencies such as cost per incremental unit, and will stay true to their funding principles.  The next step, which many have yet to take, is to understand what the sustainable price gaps are between their brands and private labels both promoted and not promoted, and to translate those insights into a category business plan that drives mutual profit growth for retailer (category level) and CPG (brand/promoted group) alike,” states Hertel.Stuart and Thompson also take consumer-centric approaches.Stuart urges CPG trade managers to “understand not only the ROI of an investment, but also the short-term and long-term changes in [shopper] behavior.”  And he poses analytical questions for CPG to assess event results:  Did we attract new users, competitive users?  Did they stay with the brand?  What was the impact not just during the immediate promotion, but [beyond]? How did the [trade event] benefit the franchise relative to alternate marketing expenditures?CPG needs to fully understand the role of everyday price in the consumer-decision process of buying the brand, states Thompson:  “I would not be spending trade dollars to unnecessarily subsidize retail price points that may not be critical.  Unnecessary subsidization robs profit or the ability to spend against building equity for the brand.”   Also important to know: the critical promoted price points to avoid over-discounting, and the promotion frequency that ensures a brand gets its fair-share promotional volume.  “We see many CPG companies spending large amounts of trade dollars to subsidize lower everyday retail price points without understanding if that spend is really effective or necessary,” Thompson adds.Over-spending is a particular temptation for smaller brands that have less influence and impact over category plans and results.  “They have to be more disciplined at establishing and adhering to their own spending principles,” says Hertel.Yet number 3 and number 4 brands can develop loyal niches within categories that have significant need for variety, whether driven by taste, convenience or efficacy, explains Stuart.  Smart trading spending can help low-cost manufacturers win “that have efficiencies of scale that rival private label and can keep their everyday gap to a minimum,” he notes.The three experts agreed that innovation is the surest differentiator of brands versus private label.  “Launching meaningful innovations well is the highest priority in our view,” says Hertel.Al Heller is co-author, Consumer-Centric Category Management (Nielsen/Wiley), and president, Distinct Communications, LLC.JUNE 2011TPM Forecast for 2012 Is Definitely Uncertain  By Al HellerTrade promotion activity could face a crossroads within the next 12 to 18 months.  Retailers’ narrow focus on profits and on private label as an engine for margin dollars limits merchandising opportunities for national brands and raises performance expectations for each CPG-funded trade event.  Concurrently, CPG companies scrutinize what they spend on trade as they figure strategies to raise ROI, says Jesse Edelman, COO of Archpoint Consulting.  This could tempt CPG to target fewer yet bigger trade events with larger chains where they see the chance" to move the needle on their business.  That’s more complex to do.  Large chain circulars are often filled with national brands and private label—and the emphasis on these leaves fewer promotional opportunities for other brands,” he told CPGmatters in an exclusive interview.  Alternately, CPG could partner with regional chains such as Wegmans, Price Chopper, Publix and Schnucks, which “out of necessity, have to become more receptive to almost becoming learning laboratories for manufacturers,” suggests Edelman.  “There’s an ever-growing divide of haves and have nots between the larger and regional chains, forcing differences in how they go to market.” If CPG companies get over their desire to scale with large retailers, they could succeed with mid-tier operators that are nimbler and would more readily use inventive trade promotions to help differentiate their stores within trading areas.“They’re more interesting places to do business. They’re more open to creativity in assortment, shelving, displays, messaging and events to influence consumers,” he adds.  “Great opportunities continue to emerge at the regional level.”Archpoint urges CPG suppliers to segment retail customers by their value to ongoing business, and to evaluate criteria beyond revenue.  A first step is to self-assess, using these questions and insights:Does your trade spend deliver a return on investment? Companies think they know, but they don’t necessarily measure the right way. It isn’t only about cases moved during a promotion event, but also an event’s influence on subsequent base shipments and other measures.Do you measure every dollar invested?  This is the black hole in the budget where leakage occurs.  The effect of  “net pricing” or “special pricing” often isn’t factored into trade spend, so it winds up influencing other parts of the profit-loss statement.Does your sales team effectively plan, execute and measure results achieved?  Manufacturers continually seek more impactful ways to spend beyond funding temporary price reductions. Perhaps in-store coupons or joint promotions with other brands would work better with certain brands or shoppers.  Still, some level of mediocrity won’t go away.  CPG executives utter the phrase, ‘if we don’t spend it, we’ll lose the budget,’ too often.Is there a process in place to accrue, allocate and manage trade budgets?  A trade promotion management (TPM) system only enables a company’s process; it doesn’t create one.How are decisions made relative to trade promotions? Who approves?  This reflects a company’s confidence in its lower levels of management to make decisions on trade promotions, say, up to $10,000.  There is so little trust, however, that decisions are increasingly pushed back into large trade marketing departments. Is a process in place to effectively handle claims and deductions? Many smaller- and medium-sized CPG companies put people against this function, which could be automated instead.   CPG should approach this with an “it’s my money” attitude, since unauthorized deductions can significantly harm cash flow.Clearly, data-based insights are key to effectively managing trade promotions. They help alleviate the sameness of trade promotions, and help increase their consumer relevancy. Yet fewer than half of CPG companies have an automated system in place to steadily monitor and evaluate their trade spend and performance, Edelman estimates.  “Consumer preference is the ultimate deciding factor in what sells through, but it isn’t in the trade promotion conversation enough between retailer and CPG partners,” says Edelman.  “It would be best if consumers were at the heart of the conversation.”That could happen increasingly as more CPG companies aim to optimize trade promotions using predictive analytics, a discipline on the rise, particularly among larger CPG brand marketers.  Their goal is to make events more productive by building off an understanding of consumer behaviors, spending patterns, lifestyles and purchase triggers.
