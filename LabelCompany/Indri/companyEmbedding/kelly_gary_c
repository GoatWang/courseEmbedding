Southwest Airlines Newsroom









































Gary C. Kelly
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

-- Download Photo --

Gary Kelly serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Southwest Airlines. Under Gary's leadership, Southwest has grown to become the nation's largest airline in terms of originating domestic passengers carried and is a mainstay on Fortune magazine's list of the most admired companies in the world, ranking eighth in 2017. In the same Fortune survey, Gary was recognized as one of the top five underrated CEOs.       
Gary is a 30-year Southwest veteran who began his career at Southwest Airlines as Controller, moving up to Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Finance, then Executive Vice President and CFO, before being promoted to CEO and Vice Chairman in July 2004. Gary assumed the roles of Chairman and President in 2008. In January 2017, Gary relinquished the title of President. Prior to joining Southwest Airlines in 1986, Gary was a CPA for Arthur Young & Company in Dallas and Controller for Systems Center, Inc.
Southwest Airlines is celebrating 44 years of consecutive profitability and was named "Airline of the Year" by Air Transport World in 2015 and named one of the Top 20 America's Best Employers of 2016 by Forbes. The nation's leading low-cost carrier has consistently received the lowest ratio of Customer Complaints to the Department of Transportation (DOT) since they began tracking Customer Satisfaction. 
Gary's biggest source of pride is the fact that Southwest Airlines has never had a single layoff in the airline's 46-year history. Gary has pioneered the airline's transformation through several key initiatives, including the acquisition of AirTran Airways, the repeal of the Wright Amendment, and the launch of international destinations for the first time in Southwest's history—all while staying true to the Company's core values and People-centric Culture.        
Gary has received numerous awards and recognitions over the years, most recently as a 2017 Junior Achievement Dallas Business Hall of Fame Laureate inductee; 2016 inductee into the Texas Business Hall of Fame; and he is the recipient of the prestigious 2016 Tony Jannus Award. Gary was named to Fortune magazine's list of the Top 20 People in Business in 2014; was twice named D CEO Magazine's CEO of the Year; he's been named one of the best CEOs in America by Institutional Investor magazine three times; and Gary was selected as Dallas Business Journal's CEO of the year for 2011. In 2010, Gary was honored with the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Texas at Austin, and in 2013, Gary was inducted into the McCombs School of Business Hall of Fame at the University of Texas at Austin. Gary received the 2013 Father of the Year Award; and Gary was the recipient of the 2013 McLane Leadership in Business Award at Texas A&M University.      
Gary is a lifelong Texan and received a B.B.A. in Accounting from the University of Texas at Austin. As a proud alumnus, Gary has served the University in a number of capacities, including on the McCombs School Advisory Council. Gary is a Certified Public Accountant and serves on the Board of Directors of the Lincoln National Corporation and Airlines for America, the airline industry advocacy group (serving as Chairman from 2012 - 2014). Gary is a current member of the Business Council and the Southwestern Medical Foundation Board of Trustees. Gary previously served on the President's Job Council.

I admire your leadership and vision you have for SWA.  I love SWA and have been trying for 10 years to get hired with your company.  So far, not good, but I would be a great asset...I promise.  I believe and lead in the same things you believe in.  Please give me a chance to prove myself or at least try.  Thanks!Lynda Blake

My dream is to work for Southwest I have a lot of experience with customer service and I'm a certified flight attendant, but there is never any jobs in Pittsburgh. So please consider me, I would go above and beyond for you company. Danielle in Pittsburgh

I would like an opportunity to work for Southwest Airlines, I&apos;ve worked at another airline in Chicago for @ 5 years in the operations dept.Southwest by far is the best airline to work for.

            Comments by Laneka Davis : Monday, May 11, 2009 at 01:55 PM
            
        
You, Mr. Kelly, are one of the most intelligent, decent, and caring C.E.O.'s I have ever encountered. You do well by your employees, your company, and your passengers. You run a top notch airline in every way. I will be flying fairly frequently from Buffalo to Las Vegas and I can go straight there, no stops and at a very reasonable rate with wonderful, comfortable, accomodations and no baggage fees for the first two bags!!I will fly no other airline but Southwest if I can possibly help it. I have many friends who say the same thing.  Congratulations to you and all of your employees.Sharon Davis

It has been 7 weeks since Southwest lost my luggage, leaving me stranded at my destination with nothing (on my 15th wedding anniversary.)  I continue to get the run around from customer service.  Why does it take so long to make your mistake right with the customer?  I will not get back the time I have spent on this claim & can not erase the memories of the rotten experience it has been. :(

            Comments by Claim #1002950811 : Thursday, April 01, 2010 at 05:29 PM
            
        
The airline (Southwest) has gone on a downhill spiral in recent years. I tried to go online and get my boarding pass and guess what, I am forced to wait 30 f---ing minutes to speak to someone that won't answer the Southwest customer service phone line. You, Gary Kelly, have taken advantage of a model airline and failed. Get your f----ng act together. People are getting fed up with your poor customer service and this needs to be resolved. Here's an example of one of your recent brilliant ideas. Give away free mixed drink tickets for 6:00 A.M. flights. What kind of business sense does that make?

            Comments by James Shoemaker : Wednesday, March 23, 2011 at 09:24 PM
            
        
You complaint department is a joke. I had to go through so many obstacles , as designed, that people give up. Do you want to know the truth?

            Comments by Dennis Giacobbe : Friday, April 01, 2011 at 06:56 PM
            
        
We were so excited to hear that SWA was coming to GSP. In December, I gave my husband, two sons and a friend in Houston, tickets for the final four. We booked the flights (not $99 as advertised) and to top it off VCU got in the final four (we are from Richmond). My family was so excited that they couldn't sleep last night. When they arrived at GSP your rep informed them with a laugh that the flight had been cancelled. We have not been able to talk to customer service yet (on hold for 2 hours). My family was rerouted from GSP to Nashville to Alabama then to Houston and will miss the VCU-Butler game. Because we have all tickets our friend in Houston also misses the game. I hope you will demonstrate the customer service that you advertised because you owe us!!

Mr. Keller,I&apos;s almost 60 yrs old and about to graduate from college.  This is my first graduation ceremony as I never completed to many things. Thank you for the inspiration.

What happened to your wonderful company?  I just spent 50 + minutes on hold for what used to be a very basic air change.  I politely asked the CSR "why the long wait?" AND I WAS PROMPTLY HUNG UP ON.  You have lost a customer!  Absolutely disgusted!

WORST airline EVER, SUCKS majorly in every area... Customer service is obviously a foreign concept to this airline.  THEY ARE THE WORST EVER AND I&apos;LL NEVER FLY AGAIN WITH THEM  They SUCK at customer service in ALL areas.

            Comments by margaret Lehmberg : Tuesday, July 12, 2011 at 05:46 PM
            
        
I was to take a vacation with your airlines on July 17th 2011 but on July 10th my husband was in a car accident.  Im trying to put my payment toward a new vacation but no one seems to want to answer me!!! When i called to cancel and see what I could do the only answer I got was since his accident was at 4:00pm on Sunday and outr flight was the next Sunday at 3:45pm it wasnt before 7 days to cancel or to move it!  15 minutes!?!? Or you serious!! He broke his back and nothing can be done???????

            Comments by Beth : Thursday, July 28, 2011 at 08:39 PM
            
        
First, I would like to say that my previous experience with Southwest has been wonderful.  Your employees are always very helpful, polite and informative.  Recently I have spoken to several people in the Customer Service Department and two supervisors.  All say "I feel so sorry for you, but I cannot help you".  "We cannot continue to make exceptions."  I would love to speak with someone who would really listen to my concern.  Thank you.  I will still fly Southwest because you still, after all this, are the best in the business.

            Comments by Helen : Friday, August 12, 2011 at 03:05 PM

Shame on your airline for its racist and homophobic practices. The latest being the homophobic removal from a flight because two women shared an afffectionate kiss.  I hope the LGBT community boycotts your airline.I know i will from now on! Virgin American is a better choice even with bsaggage fees.  Shame on you!!! Your crew should be have much beter diversity training.  Wonder what would happen if someone complined about a straight couple kissing, even passionately??? Kicked off the flight?  I seriously doubt it. These type actions will be your demise in the end.  Too many examples are happening of late. Bye Bye Southwest!!

I have only the best experiences with your airline.  Why can't there be a nonstop to Dulles or Reagan?  The biggest problem is the fact that you still serve peanuts.  There are many other snacks that are not life threatening to so many.  My daughter and family travel many times a year but cannot fly with you for that reason. Please consider changing your snacks.  Thank you.

I  am thrilled with the design of your new planes. The high ceilings, extra-wide seats and leg room make me feel like I'm flying first-class.How can you fly bags free,  give away unlimited free snacks, have a friendly "service first" atmosphere, have the most competitive airfare rates and STILL afford to build these new planes?  It amazes me. I'd like to see you surcharge every ticket $10 and add the funds to your capital improvements project to build more of these planes!

I bought roundtrip SW airlines plane tickets from Portland, OR to Philadelphia, PA. because your airline advertises no baggage or change fees.  When I tried to change my return date from Philadelphia to PDX four days prior to booked departure I was charged an $800 fee because of some stupid jargon called SODA. Please refund my change fee or I will sue for false advertising. Posters in the Denver airport brag about no change fees period, no exceptions. That is false advertising.

I cancelled two airline tickets with the understanding I would be given credit for the future. Customer service failed to inform me there would be a $75 service fee per ticket to utilize my money. Notified Supervisor of my concern with a response of it's our policy. So much for the customer service marketed to the consumer.

I think Gary Kelly should get in touch with his employees.  I've had a oil painting stolen from the check-in desk in New Orleans Airport and no one will address this issue.  What in the world are you doing Gary Kelly other than making money off us.

            Comments by Lois : Monday, February 04, 2013 at 01:21 PM
            
        
We fly with SWA almost every other weekend and 2 out of every 3 flights are always delayed.  Every route is also with a connection which also always delayed. Fix your business.  This is not a good practice. for getting $3+mill salary a year you sure are not doing a good job. I hope you can make an improvement.

The Mission of Southwest Airlines
The mission of Southwest Airlines is dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit.
To Our Employees
We are committed to provide our Employees a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth. Creativity and innovation are encouraged for improving the effectiveness of Southwest Airlines. Above all, Employees will be provided the same concern, respect, and caring attitude within the organization that they are expected to share externally with every Southwest Customer.
January 1988



We Weren't Just Airborne Yesterday - Time flies when you're having fun!
More than 38 years ago, Rollin King and Herb Kelleher got together and decided to start a different kind of airline. They began with one simple notion: If you get your passengers to their destinations when they want to get there, on time, at the lowest possible fares, and make darn sure they have a good time doing it, people will fly your airline. And you know what? They were right.

What's LUV?
Southwest has been in LUV with our Customers from the very beginning. Therefore, it's fitting that we began service to San Antonio and Houston from Love Field in Dallas on June 18, 1971. As our Company and Customers grew, our LUV grew too! With the prettiest Flight Attendants serving "Love Bites" on our planes, and determined Employees issuing tickets from our "Love Machines," we changed the face of the airline industry throughout the 1970s. Then in 1977, our stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "LUV." Over the ensuing years, our LUV has spread from coast to coast and border to border thanks to our hardworking Employees and their LUV for Customer Service.


Our Commitments
We don't take our commitments lightly. We are dedicated to doing the right thing, we take great strides to ensure your safety, and fostering trusting relationships between our Employees, our Customer, our Suppliers, and our Planet.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
