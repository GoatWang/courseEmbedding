LIMITED WARRANTY
 
Jonathan Louis International (“JLI”) provides this Limited Warranty to the original retail purchaser of our products for consumer use (“you”). No warranty is provided to subsequent purchasers or to purchasers of our products for commercial, rental or institutional purposes.
 
What Does This Warranty Cover? This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship in your new furniture under normal use.
 
How Long Does This Warranty Last? THIS WARRANTY LASTS FOR:

WOODEN FRAME - LIFETIME OF THE PRODUCT. FOR PURPOSES HEREOF, LIFETIME SHALL MEAN SEVEN (7) YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE WHICH IS THE ANTICIPATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE FURNITURE.
FOUR (4) YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT DISCLAIMED HEREIN.
SEAT CUSHION FOAM, FILLING, SPRINGS - THREE (3) YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE.
FABRIC AND ALL OTHER ELEMENTS - ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE

 
 
Notwithstanding the above, this warranty will terminate sooner if the original purchaser transfers the product to someone else. Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. 
 
What This Warranty Does Not Cover
For purposes hereof, “defects” does not include natural markings, brands, scars (in the case of leather or wood), grain or color variations, wrinkles or other natural or ordinary characteristics of the exterior of your furniture, fading, pilling or dye lot variations.
 
This warranty does not cover purchasers of our products for commercial, rental or institutional purposes.
 
The use of any sample or model in connection with your purchase of our products is for illustrative purposes only, is not part of the basis of the bargain, and is not to be construed as a warranty that the product that you receive will conform to the sample or model. Products sold “as is” and/or “floor models” are not covered by this warranty.
 
This warranty does not cover any problem caused by transportation, delivery, set up or conditions of the location of use of the product, abuse, misuse, use of the product for other than its customary or normal use, accidents, outdoor use, ordinary wear and tear, failure to follow instructions, improper maintenance or cleaning, damage caused by heavy soiling, pets, accidents or an act of God (such as a flood).
 
For information on the proper maintenance and cleaning of our products, please go to www.JonathanLouis.net./resourceguide/
 
This warranty does not cover damage to floors, flooring, floor coverings (including without limitation carpet or rugs) or other property caused by dragging our products across the floor or the movement of our products on or about the floor, flooring, floor coverings or other property.  Furniture should be kept on an area rug or protective pads when on hardwood floors to keep from potentially scratching the floors.
 
Consequential and incidental damages are not recoverable under this express or any implied warranty nor are damages arising out of or related to the inability to use the product. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
 
JLI MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY THAT ITS PRODUCTS ARE FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE DESCRIPTION ON THE FACE OF THIS LIMTIED WARRANTY. Except as expressly set forth herein, all other warranties are disclaimed and our products are being sold on an “as is” basis. There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
 
What Will JLI Do? JLI will repair or replace any materially defective product at no charge to you. If identical materials are not available at the time of product service, JLI reserves the right to substitute materials which may be of a different type, pattern, color, grain, texture, fabric, leather or wood, but of equal or higher quality. For one (1) year after the date of the original purchase, JLI will pay the costs of parts, labor, and shipping to and from the authorized dealer to JLI, if necessary. Thereafter, to the extent of any continued warranty, JLI will pay for parts and you will be required to pay all other cost, including shipping and labor.
 
How Do You Get Service? Contact the authorized dealer or retailer of the product or contact JLI at 544 W. 130th Street, Gardena, CA  90248, attention: Customer Service/Warranty Dept. Such person will ask you to demonstrate that you were the original purchaser of this product so please keep your receipt or sales invoice. You will also need to provide evidence of the alleged defect. Either the authorized dealer or JLI may inspect the product that you allege is defective or require you to transport such product to JLI for inspection. If JLI does not believe that the item is defective, it will notify you in writing and, if it had received it for inspection, return it to you. If JLI does believe that the item is defective, it will repair or replace it, in its sole discretion, at its sole cost.
 
How Do You Resolve Disputes? Before suing under Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, you and JLI agree to settle by private, confidential arbitration any claims and controversies either party may have against the other arising out of or related to this Limited Warranty and/or JLI’s products or services (“Arbitrable Claims”).  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that all Arbitrable Claims will be resolved by private, confidential arbitration as set forth herein.
 
You agree to pursue the Arbitrable Claims in an individual capacity and not as class representative or class member in any purported class action proceeding.
 
Written notice to JLI shall be sent to 544 W. 130th Street, Gardena, CA  90248 attention:  Warranty Claims Dept.  The written notice shall identify and describe the nature of the claims asserted and detail the facts upon which such claims are based.  The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
 
The arbitration shall be conducted confidentially before a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the claim is made, and a judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the JAMS rules shall govern selection.  A copy of the current rules can be viewed online at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.  Such arbitration shall be filed with JAMS and heard in Los Angeles, California. Their address is: 555 West Fifth Street (Gas Company Tower), 32nd Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90013, USA. Their phone number is: 213-620-1133.  
 
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1283.05, which provides for certain discovery rights, shall apply to any arbitration.  All rights, causes of action, remedies and defenses available under applicable law are available to the parties, and shall be applicable as through a court of law, including the right to file a motion for summary judgment.  The arbitrator shall apply the applicable statute of limitations to any claim.  Any party may be represented at the arbitration by an attorney or other representative selected by the party, at his/her or its costs, and the arbitrator shall apply, as applicable, federal or California substantive law and law of remedies.  The arbitrator’s remedial authority shall be no greater than that which is available under the statutory or common law theory asserted and the arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract or modify the terms of this Limited Warranty except where necessary for the enforcement of this Limited Warranty.  The arbitrator lacks the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning or to make factual findings unsupported by the evidence, and the award may be vacated or corrected by a court for exceeding arbitral powers.  The court may enter judgment upon a final arbitration award either by (i) confirming the award or (ii) vacating, modifying or correcting the award on any ground referenced in the Federal Arbitration Act, California Code of Civil Procedure §1286 et seq., or other similar state law. 
 
The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion that includes the factual and legal basis for any decision and award within forty (40) days from the date the arbitration hearing concludes or the post-hearing briefs (if requested) are filed, whichever is later. 
 
JLI shall bear the cost of the arbitrator’s fees and other costs unique to arbitration to the extent required by applicable law.
 
Entire Understanding. This Limited Warranty sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other oral or written representations and understandings.  This Limited Warranty may only be amended or modified by a writing signed in advance by the President of JLI. Your exclusive remedy for Arbitrable Claims shall be to make a claim and resolve it as set forth herein.
 
Severability.  This Limited Warranty is severable and that in the event any provision of this Limited Warranty is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired.  Additionally, the parties expressly grant to any arbitrator, court or other entity interpreting this Limited Warranty the power and authority to modify the terms of this Limited Warranty to extent necessary to allow enforcement of this Limited Warranty to the fullest extent allowed by law.
 
Successors and Assigns.  This Limited Warranty cannot be assigned by you without the prior written consent of the President of JLI (which may be withheld in his/her sole discretion). This Limited Warranty is binding upon and inures to the benefit of successors, assigns and legal representatives of the parties.
 
How Does State Law Apply? This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
 
 
[END OF LIMITED WARRANTY]

Product Story
Designer








				Don Chadwick, who has dedicated his career to understanding the complex relationship between humans and furniture, proves that comfort and simplicity can coexist.

Having realised that abundant controls in no way ensure comfort, he designed a smarter chair — one that is adjusted not by the user but instead adjusts to the user. Through innovative design and expert engineering, Chadwick® takes the burden of comfort out of the user’s hand.
				








				In the last few decades, Don Chadwick has pioneered the use of modern materials, moulding processes and mechanisms leading to cutting-edge products that have raised the standard for their market. A native of Southern California, Don Chadwick received his principal training in design at the University of California, Los Angeles. He then worked for architect Victor Gruen before establishing his own practice in 1964. In 1974, Chadwick designed Chadwick Modular Seating. In collaboration with William Stumpf he designed the Equa 1 flexing-plastic chair (1984). Then in 1994, the landmark Aeron chair catapulted Chadwick to national attention; the Industrial Designers Society of America and Business Week Magazine awarded Design of the Decade to the Aeron chair in 1999. Chadwick has received numerous awards over the past three and a half decades. Chadwick’s relationship with Knoll marks a milestone in the career of an inventive designer. “I am gratified to be part of the Knoll legacy; I consider Knoll to be at the highest level of contemporary design, and our collaboration is a notable one for me.” With the Chadwick chair, he has proven himself as effective at bringing a product to market as he has been at creating the market itself.

Chadwick Rantanen | Jonathan Griffin
































































Jonathan Griffin


		Criticism and essays on art and culture	



Chadwick Rantanen by Jonathan Griffin

Team Bungalow, Los Angeles
Chadwick Rantanen, Deer Rear, 2017, installation view Team Bungalow, Los Angeles
The pall of death hangs over Chadwick Rantanen’s exhibition ‘Alarmer’. This is ironic because many of the constituent objects in his assemblage sculptures are expressly designed to simulate life. Battery-operated hunting decoys flap their wings and wag their tails in order to attract animals that are living (though soon to be dead).
Rantanen’s Deer Rear (all works 2017) is a pitiful construction. The stylized hindquarters of a deer are laid on the floor, black electrical guts spilling out of the creature’s belly. With an irregular force and tempo, its tail twitches as if it were in the final stages of expiration. In a sense, this is indeed the case: the tail is powered by a dying power pack, which the artist has fitted with batteries smaller than those intended by the manufacturer. As a paradoxical consequence, the decoy is animated with an uncannily realistic weariness.

Rantanen often works with brand-new objects that are already tired in all sorts of ways. Consumer products, probably made in Chinabut associated with red-state Americana, speak of a broader national malaise. Between the petrochemical origin of these plastics and the decoys’ intended violence, there liesan implicit position of antagonismtowards the natural environment, even as its resources are depleted.
The batteries that power the kinetic sculptures in ‘Alarmer’ are cased in plastic sleeves, designed by Rantanen, which resemble cartoon bees. These yellow and black striped covers enable them to fit into slots for the fatter (and higher capacity) batteries, while their plastic wings serve no function except to prevent the cover from closing. Bees, today, are contradictory symbols: of Utopian collectivism and – as Colony Collapse Disorder takes hold across North America and parts of Europe – of environmental catastrophe.
All around Deer Rear, in the shed-like back gallery of Team Bungalow, sculptures that look like ornate, Jorge Pardo-designed flypapers hang from the ceiling. The templates for the scalloped forms come from a pattern designed for products meant for use in hospitals – gowns, wallpaper, curtains, carpets – which is intended to be aesthetically inert. The installation is titled Hanging Strips (Yellow) – yellow because parts of the translucent plastic are smeared, repellently, with silicone glue. Stuck to this mucous substance are wrinkled flakes ofa darker material, identified by the checklist as antimicrobial film – which Rantanen reportedly painstakingly scrapes off hospital fabrics. The result is an artwork for the post-nature era.

The icky smeared silicone and antimicrobial film reappears in another, medically inflected sculpture, Admitting (Green): a folded rectangle of corrugated plastic on the floor, the interior gunk only visible through circular apertures and its two open ends. Far more compelling is the large, hanging sculpture Crow Spread, with which it shares Team Bungalow’s front space. This show-stopping work resembles the horrific spectacle of six crows strung up by their feet and flapping in panic. As with Deer Rear, the birds are decoys hacked by Rantanen’s battery adapters, busy bees that seem like parasites, cheerfully speeding the death throes of the trapped birds. The piece is a chandelier for a psychopath’s dining room.
The final irony, of course, is that any owner of these kinetic sculptures will be obliged to care for them by endlessly replacing the batteries, which the motors drain all too quickly. The bees may be powering these end-of-life simulations, but they are themselves designed to die fast. Deception is built upon cruel deception: the illusion of life in these works leads to death, if you’re a crow, or to a repeating simulation of death, if you’re lucky enough to be a human.

Chadwick proposes increasing legal age to buy tobacco products







Tuesday
Sep 16, 2014 at 12:01 AM
Sep 16, 2014 at 11:37 AM






				By ANDREW DENNEYadenney@columbiatribune.com | 815-1719
			
First Ward Councilwoman Ginny Chadwick has called for Columbia to ban the use of e-cigarettes indoors and to increase the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to 21.The council unanimously passed a motion just after midnight on Tuesday at its regular meeting to send the legislative intent for Chadwick�s proposal to the city�s Board of Health and Substance Abuse Advisory Commission for review before a complete bill is presented to the council for a vote.Smoking in indoor public spaces has been banned in Columbia since 2007.In remarks during the council comments portion of the meeting agenda, in which council members are able to propose motions for a vote, Chadwick said raising the minimum age would lower the use of tobacco products by youth by making it easier to spot underage purchasers, decrease cultural acceptance of youth smoking and cut off peers� access to the products.�This decrease will create lasting benefits on the prevalence of tobacco use and save thousands of lives in Columbia,� Chadwick said.Jonathan Sessions, a member of the Columbia Board of Education, said he approached Chadwick with the idea of increasing the tobacco-sale age while she was still running for office earlier this year. Sessions said that because there are 18-year-old students at Columbia Public Schools, there is potential for students to legally acquire tobacco products and then distribute them to younger students.�It happened when I was in school, it happened, I�m sure, before I was in school, it happens to this day,� Sessions said.According to a Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products literature review released last December, there are a number of barriers to determining the toxicity of e-cigarettes: There is sparse data available on the effects of exposing humans to e-cigarettes, e-cigarette users also might use cigarettes � which can alter exposure levels � and some research has indicated that nicotine delivery levels from e-cigarettes can vary substantially even among devices within the same brand.Despite the dearth of available information about the product, advertising for e-cigarettes has been aggressive.According to an analysis of e-cigarette websites conducted this year by the San Francisco Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, 95 percent of the websites made explicit health claims, 88 percent said the devices can be used anywhere and 64 percent mentioned smoking cessation.Dan Rader, a member of the Substance Abuse Advisory Commission and co-owner of Bengal�s Bar and Grill in downtown Columbia, said he thinks the proposals are a �step in the right direction.� The use of e-cigarettes by Bengal�s patrons has caused issues at the bar in the past, he said, as staff and fellow patrons have confused the devices with cigarettes.Additionally, Rader said he supports applying the same age restrictions that are in place for alcohol to tobacco products.�I think it�s become quite clear over time that cigarettes are harmful,� Rader said. �Bringing that minimum age more in line with the minimum age for alcohol, it makes sense.�

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
