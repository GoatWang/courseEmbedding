Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Biography & Autobiography Books

Biography & Autobiography Books offer more insight into the lives of public figures than a squadron of stalkers armed with video cameras. You can get the inside story on famous figures from any era from history, either from expert biographers or from the subjects themselves. Dig into far-ranging topics like Bill O'Reilly's take on J.F.K., or a sassy memoir from comedy queen Tina Fey, or Piper Kerman's no holds barred glimpse at life in a women's prison. Our staggeringly vast selection of biographies, autobiographies, memoirs and first person narratives will feed your needs.




Here Comes Trouble
A wild take no-prisoners ride. Michael Moore catapults readers along a revealing journey through his early life. The Academy Award-winning director and producer of Bowling for Columbine, Roger & Me, and Fahrenheit 9/11—reveals himself an insightful memoirist and artful storyteller. From an accidental brush with Bobby Kennedy to a lucky escape from terrorist Abu Nidal, each chapter reveals there's "Moore" to the man than first meets the eye. Alternately funny, eye-opening, and moving, Here Comes Trouble may well surprise fans of Moore's films with its deeply personal tone and unflinching honesty.
