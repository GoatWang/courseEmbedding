The Fund
The Fund seeks to exploit investment opportunities in the high-yield market, primarily through diversified exposure to high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds. Investment opportunities that maximize total return are sought through a well-defined investment  process that has been in place for over 20 years.



The Approach
Fundamental bottom-up credit research is the cornerstone of our approach to high-yield investing. We combine our fundamental research with an investment process that emphasizes both risk management and relative-value investing to achieve competitive risk -adjusted returns.



The Features
The Fund's high-yield bond holdings have historically produced higher income and lower correlation to interest-rate movements than higher-quality corporate bonds. In addition to high current income, the Fund offers the potential for capital appreciation.







 

 OverviewIncome Fund of Boston has generated mostly excess returns above its peer group since the current portfolio manager began managing the Fund.1

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should revi ew the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
High-yield bonds started the year strong, benefiting from post-election optimism regarding potential tax reform, deregulation and fiscal stimulus. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings reports and improving economic data also helped. Market conditions, howev er, weakened in March. Oil prices started to slide, pressuring returns in energy, the largest sector weighting in the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index (the Index).2 In addition, concern about an accelerated timetable for interest rate hikes sa pped investors' appetite for risk, undermining demand. Concurrently, new high-yield bond issuance surged as refinancings rose ahead of further interest-rate increases or possible tax changes affecting the deductibility of interest expenses. The Federal R eserve's (Fed's) March 15 decision to inch its key target rate higher had little impact on high yield, but the asset class did see inflows pick up as expectations for the pace of future rate increases eased. This tailwind was somewhat offset by Republica ns' inability to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about when and if the new administration would be able to pass much-anticipated tax reform and meaningful fiscal stimulus.
High-yield bond fundamentals continued to improve, as evidenced by better revenue and earnings growth numbers. Corporate leverage modestly decreased for the second consecutive quarter due to improved earnings and interest coverage, a measure of high-yiel d issuers' ability to service their debt obligations. The trailing 12-month default rate declined to 1.90% at quarter end, down from 3.57% at the start of the year, due to the fact that Q1 2016's elevated defaults in the energy and metals/mining sectors  have now rolled off the trailing 12-month period. The default rate ex-energy and metals/mining issuers is currently 0.65%. Average yields on high-yield bonds tightened to 5.88%, and prices modestly improved.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Index returned 2.71%, beating the 0.82% gain of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index,12 but lagging the 6.07% return of the S&P 500 Index.13 Within the Index, lower-quality and longer-durati on issues posted the strongest gains.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston (the Fund) posted a modest gain at net asset value for the quarter that was slightly behind the return of the Index.

The Fund's higher-quality, lower-volatility bias, notably in the CCC- and B-rated segments and the energy sector, protected the Fund in March, but hindered performance for the quarter, as lower-quality issues outperformed.
Duration14 positioning hampered performance, largely because of the Fund's overweight in shorter-duration issues, which lagged longer-duration bonds, and credit selection in the two-to five-year duration segment.
By contrast, the Fund benefited from a small equity position, mostly acquired through restructuring, and an underweight in the weaker-performing BB category.
Credit selection was positive in the services, diversified financial services, air transportation and chemicals segments, which generally benefited from expectations of improved economic growth.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

A small post-restructuring equity position benefited performance most.
An underweight in the weaker-performing BB segment also had a positive impact.
Credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance, led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over 40% for the quarter.
Credit selection in the air transportation, diversified financial services and chemicals categories positively affected Fund performance. Top individual contributors included overweights in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company, an aircra ft leasing operation, a rebounding corporate jet charter operation and a producer of titanium dioxide.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

Credit selection in the CCC- and B-rated segments hurt, largely because the Fund favored higher-quality, less volatile bonds that lagged lower-quality issues.
Credit selection among two- to five-year duration bonds, along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less detracted from Fund performance.
Credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted from Fund performance. The Fund's quality bias also hindered performance in energy.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We think the backdrop for high-yield bonds remains supportive. Going forward, we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices. While short-term interest rates will likely increase, we don't think the economy will overheat to t he point where the Fed becomes overly aggressive. What is less clear is when, or if, proposed pro-growth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets.
Some of the government's proposed initiatives, if approved, could have a positive effect on high-yield bonds. For example, if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed, that could, on the margin, lead to less new issuance i n high-yield. At the same time, a lower tax rate on interest income earned by high-income filers could boost demand for high yield. The implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the U.S. economic  recovery, in turn aiding high-yield fundamentals and driving down default rates.
We recognize, however, that there also are potential headwinds for the asset class. Volatility could be elevated, especially given uncertainty over the Republicans' ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus. A choppy market may dampen demand f or high-yield bonds. Disappointing progress in Washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure high-yield bond returns. Additionally, if OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countrie s) doesn't follow through on its planned production cuts, oil prices could pull back further, hurting the energy sector.Given relatively high valuations on high-yield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility, we've kept the Fund conserv atively positioned, maintaining a shorter duration and higher-quality bias than the Index. By employing this strategy aimed at protecting the Fund's downside and minimizing volatility, we believe we can stay ahead of the Index in market declines and capt ure much of the upside in rallies, which would help drive long-term relative performance. At period end, the Fund's average duration was 3.2 years, compared to the Index's duration of 3.9 years. In addition, the Fund's biggest credit concentration was in  B-rated bonds, which generally have less duration. Lower duration usually means bond prices decline less as credit spreads widen.
At period-end, the Fund had a small allocation to the higher-quality split-rated BB/BBB segment and in the CCC and B rated segments, representing a bias toward less volatile issues. In the energy sector, we've continued to favor higher-quality, lower-cos t producers that, in our view, are less susceptible to price volatility. During the quarter, we added to some of our core exploration and production names and took advantage of opportunities in energy services. Our energy stake at quarter end was roughly  in line with the sector's approximately 14% weight in the Index. In healthcare, the second largest sector in the Fund, we had a bias toward bonds issued by healthcare services providers and companies that serve to reduce cost, such as contract research  organizations (CROs). The Fund was underweight hospital bonds, which could be vulnerable to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and had a shorter duration focus in the pharmaceutical segment.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.





The views expressed in this report are those of portfolio manager(s) and are current only through the date stated at the top of this page. These views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions, and Eaton Vance disclaims any  responsibility to update such views. These views may not be relied upon as investment advice and, because investment decisions are based on many factors, may not be relied upon as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Eaton Vance fund. This co mmentary may contain statements that are not historical facts, referred to as "forward looking statements". The Fund's actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward-looking statement, depending on factors such  as changes in securities or financial markets or general economic conditions, the volume of sales and purchases of Fund shares, the continuation of investment advisory, administrative and service contracts, and other risks discussed from time to time in  the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should revi ew the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.

 2. Maximize

            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in
