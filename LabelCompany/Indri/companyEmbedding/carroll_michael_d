Comments are also gathered from the same survey and displayed in their entirety with the exception of any language that may be considered slander, libel or contain private health information, which will be removed prior to publishing the comments.

9002/22/2017I have been a patient of Dr. Carroll's for over 15 years now and he has been a good doctor for me.Providence Health & Services Patient9002/11/2017[...] Clinic has improved.  Clear that an effort to be efficient is being made.  like email availabilityProvidence Health & Services Patient10002/06/2017Dr Carroll is exceptionally patient oriented. Sympathetic and practical, he makes every effort to solve my medical needs, and does so with good humor. Highly recommended.Providence Health & Services Patient10002/06/2017I Love Dr. Carroll. I will not see any other provider other than him. He listens and is practical with his diagnosis and wants and needs of his patients. I  feel that other providers could take a page from his book and treat the patient as a person and not just another patient on their workqueProvidence Health & Services Patient10001/23/2017Dr. Carroll has been PCP for many years. We openly dialogue on my health care needs and he insisted that I have a biopsy when I thought it wasnt necessary. PSA was low, but he insisted that I do it. He was right, cancer was found and treated immediately.  For that I'm very much appreciated his concern and making sure I follow through.Providence Health & Services Patient10001/18/2017Best doctor I have had in decades and have recommended to family and several friends.Providence Health & Services Patient10001/17/2017Because I went early AM - very smooth.Providence Health & Services Patient10001/13/2017I have kept my excellent doctor for over 20 years because he takes such great care of me and knows my history.Providence Health & Services Patient10001/11/2017Dr. Carroll has been my Doctor for a very long time. At least 16 years, maybe more. We have a wonderful rapport. I trust him and know that he cares and can and will work with me. The nurse who brought me in was "subbing" for another who was sick, she was fabulous! The medical technician who gave me two shots was fabulous also. You have great people.Providence Health & Services Patient8001/10/2017Dr. Carroll was not scheduled to see me on this ergency visit. He saw me waiting in the hall and rearranged his schedule.Providence Health & Services Patient10001/04/2017Dr Carroll is very thorough with all aspects related to my health and all other questions I put to him during my visits.

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Carroll, Michael D carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Carroll, Michael D currently holds license CARROMD875N3 , which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Carroll, Michael D



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Carroll, Michael D



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
