Joseph J. Grano, Jr.


          	Chairman and CEO of Centurion Holdings


                          By Roy Asfar                          
Sep 8, 2010





















 Joseph J. Grano, Jr.





Joe Grano has done much more than prove a kid with working class roots can make it on the battlefield and in the boardroom. The former Green Beret earned his place with a front-row seat to events that have shaped our history over the last four decades. Today, he channels his energy and experience to inspire younger generations – including fellow vets – to find their path to success.
"In the last 40 years, there have been significant events, including Vietnam. And bull markets, bear markets, crashes, 9/11...For a street kid in Hartford – if you can rise to the occasion, you can contribute to the solution, that is the beauty of America. It is a meritocracy," he told Veterans Advantage in an exclusive interview.
Grano holds claim to being the last Chairman presiding over the legendary Wall Street firm Paine Webber, after posting a successful turnaround and subsequently engineering a multibillion dollar merger with UBS. No longer on Wall Street, he landed himself a successful second act as a corporate advisor through his company, Centurion Holdings, and producer of the wildly successful Broadway musical "Jersey Boys." He has been hailed as a great American patriot, serving with honor and distinction in the Army, leading a stock market restart after 9/11, and chairing President George W. Bush's Homeland Security Advisory Council. In those precarious months and years after the terrorist attacks, the Council created, under Grano's leadership, a blueprint for organizing the concept of homeland security.
"We had a great group of people [on the council] that were very dedicated. And for me, who would hate to be sitting on the sidelines when we've been attacked on our shore for the second time [including] Pearl Harbor, it was a privilege to get engaged and do what I could. Frankly, if the uniform still fit, I would have been in," he adds.
Grano's unique blend of military, national security and business acumen helped define the initial objectives for our nation in the post-9/11 world. "If we don't get this terrorist situation right, from the point of prevention and reduction, what do you think that would do to our economy? Let something happen and see what happens to our consumer base. There's your threat," he told the New York Times in September 2002, soon after taking the helm of the President's Council.
Finding himself inspired after writing a heart-to-heart letter to his son, Grano wrote his recently published book, "You Can't Predict a Hero" to instill a sense of confidence and can-do spirit for the youth of our nation – those just entering business from college or the battlefield.
"It is more about life and inspiration," he says. "For kids and veterans getting back into civilian life."
Grano's commitment to helping our nation's youth runs deep. He's a long time supporter of the Yankee Foundation as a fundraiser Chairman, the YMCA of Greater New York, Police Athletic League, Inner City schools of the Archdiocese of the City of New York, Ronald McDonald House, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, among others. Dedicating his book "to the magnificent individuals with whom I have had the honor to lead in the course of my military and business careers," he thanks the "warriors" and "citizen soldiers" with whom he served in Latin America and Vietnam. As a spirited advocate for hiring veterans, Grano has lobbied hard with Washington for each corporation to commit at least 10% of its candidate pool to comprise military veterans.
POWER OVER YOUR MIND AND OPTIMISM
	Grano's sense of service may have been designed in his DNA, although the path he took with those genes was purely his own choosing. His father served for nine years, including during World War II, and rose to master sergeant.  One brother served in the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, while the other was an instructor at West Point. His uncles served in WWII and Korea.
"Military service was always viewed as an obligation," he said. "One that was very well regarded in my family."
Grano was the first in his family to attend college. While military service interrupted his education, he went on to great success in business without the benefit of a bachelor's or master's degree. Overcoming enormous adversity, he proceeded to reach the very top of Corporate America, and created a uniquely American success story. Along the way he has been awarded five Honorary Doctorate Degrees and was named Business Leader of the Year by Georgetown University.
As a young Army captain patrolling the jungles of Vietnam, a booby trap built from a grenade and a 105 mm artillery round put him in the center of an explosion that led many of his men to believe he was dead. "If I had gone into shock, I would have been a double amputee today," he later reflects. Severely wounded with his left arm partially severed, he endured six months of operations and rehabilitation, but remained positive. Discharged from the Army with a 60% disability, Vietnam however provided valuable life lessons for the young captain. As he writes in his book:
"War also gave me the priceless gift of perspective. Ever since, I've been able to remain sober and dispassionate in the face of the most trying, traumatic, and potentially disastrous personal and business situations because I can honestly say, 'It's not Vietnam,' and mean it."
"The message that I would give to any wounded vet -- don't ever underestimate the power of your mind and the power of optimism," he tells Veterans Advantage.






 Grano's Inspirational Book, "You Can't Predict a Hero"





LEADERSHIP
	"You Can't Predict a Hero" tells the story of a young man, a wounded warrior returning from Vietnam, "physically devastated, but psychologically more powerful than ever before." With a will to win and to overcome adversity, without the benefit of a college education, Grano applied his military background and lessons in leadership, and proceeded to put together his business career.
"I don't think there's any stress even in the corporate world that could match it [military combat], but more importantly, it allows you to assimilate and process information much more quickly than someone who has never had that experience, and it allows you to maintain a cool head when everyone is frantic and in a crisis. I don't know if I would have been able to deal with those challenges in that same way if I didn't have that experience."
Throughout his career, Grano provided an ingredient in short supply on Wall Street – inspired and dedicated leadership. Prior to joining PaineWebber, Grano held various senior management positions with Merrill Lynch, including Director of National Sales. In 1987, he was named the industry's best retail marketing executive in a survey conducted by Investment Dealers' Digest. He later served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the NASD and a member of the NASD's Executive Committee.
According to Grano, there are trappings of modern day life that run counter to good business sense and he remains on guard against these bad habits. Email is a detriment to getting work done. Direct communications is the best way to read the needs of those he works with. "Too much gets lost by letting the radio operators screen the dialogue. It's no different in business: you need a pulse, you need to read the signs," he says in "You Can't Predict a Hero."
THE BEAUTY OF THIS COUNTRY
	"You couldn't pick a more challenging 40 years, but simultaneous to that, you couldn't pick a bigger opportunity for someone who wanted to jump in a foxhole. That is the beauty of this country, it is a true meritocracy," says Grano.
Anywhere, at anytime, ordinary people, according to Grano, are capable of extraordinary acts. While he maintains that "you can't predict a hero," Joe Grano is just that – a genuine Hero for our time.

NEW YORK, March 31, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Joseph J. Grano, Jr.,  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of root9B Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: RTNB), today issued a Letter to Shareholders in connection with the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2015.  Investors may access these documents, free of charge, at www.sec.gov or via the "Investors Relations" section of the Company's web site at www.root9btechnologies.com.     
In his letter, Mr. Grano updates investors on the progress associated with the Company's continued evolution into a premier provider of cybersecurity and regulatory risk mitigation services, discusses 2014 operating results, and provides an outlook for 2015.   
The complete text of the letter follows:
March 30, 2015
Dear Shareholder,
It's been five months since my last letter to you.  During that time, root9B Technologies has continued with the plan of reorganization outlined in our last communication in preparation for the execution phase of our growth strategy.    
We have made substantial progress in enhancing the game-changing capabilities of our wholly-owned cybersecurity subsidiary, root9B, and narrowing our focus by concentrating on cybersecurity and regulatory risk mitigation.  Consistent with these objectives, we commenced a rebranding initiative and, effective December 1, 2014, changed our name and stock symbol to root9B Technologies, Inc. and "RTNB," respectively.   
A successful growth strategy requires a strong foundation built on organizational strength and solid economics.  We enhanced both critical areas with our February 2015 acquisition of IPSA International, now a wholly owned subsidiary of root9B Technologies.  IPSA, with 2014 revenues of approximately $41 million (up 24% from 2013), provides anti-money laundering solutions, investigative due diligence, litigation support, anti-bribery/corruption training, investigative services, and extensive background verification on behalf of several sovereign nations to support the issuance of International Passports.  IPSA's risk mitigation services provide a proven and reliable complement to our Business Advisory Solutions unit and significantly increases our suite of client service offerings, financial scale, and geographic reach.  In addition, IPSA provides us with an excellent opportunity to introduce root9B's innovative cybersecurity services to IPSA's current and future client base.  We welcomed some very talented executives to the team as a result of this acquisition, including Dan Wachtler, who will continue as CEO of IPSA and has joined root9B Technologies' Executive Management Committee and the Board of Directors Jillian Pap, IPSA's CAO and Kim Marsh, EVP of International Business. 
The integration of IPSA will continue over the next 9-12 months.  As part of this process we will merge Business Advisory Solutions and IPSA into one Regulatory Risk Mitigation unit that will operate as IPSA International, a root9B Technologies Company.  We believe that combining the businesses is consistent with our organizational commitment to serve the needs of our three most important constituencies: our clients, our shareholders, and our employees. Graeme Booth who ran Business Advisory Solutions has been appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of IPSA and will continue to serve on the Executive Management Committee of root9B Technologies.  
Our wholly owned cybersecurity subsidiary root9B has continued to enhance its capabilities as a dynamic provider of cybersecurity and advanced training, operational support, and developer of game changing technology innovations and solutions.  We have continued to attract and hire some of the most accomplished, experienced and highly regarded cybersecurity specialists in the country, and now employ 45 uniquely qualified subject matter experts.  In the last 5 months, we have further refined and verified through Proof of Concepts (POC's) our proprietary Orion HUNT platform, and a newly introduced mobile version of Orion.  root9B has also developed a new proprietary service offering that identifies unauthorized use of credentials at an enterprise level. Matt Weeks, root9B Director of Emerging Technologies, recently presented this new service offering at this year's Applied Security Conference in Vancouver, CanSecWest 2015.  This, along with several more products will deliver unique innovative solutions when released later this year.  We believe root9B's team, operational and subject matter expertise and game changing solutions are unique in the industry.  We believe that we are positioned to take a leading role in facilitating cooperation and the exchange of information between public and private entities now required to adequately address the cybersecurity threat facing our nation. The recent hires of John Harbaugh one of the small number of NSA Certified Master-Level Operators, former intelligence community senior executive and member of the NSA Advisory Board(NSAAB) Emerging Technologies Panel; Leslie Clark, recipient of the National Intelligence Exceptional Achievement Medal and former NSA Cyber Portfolio Lead to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS);  Hank Bond former Director of Cyberspace Operations and Chief Information Office at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Command (NORTHCOM);   Aaron Shaha, former Technical Director for the NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC) and recipient of the National Intelligence Award-Exceptional Achievement Medal; Eric Stride former Regional Chief of Cyber Operations for NSA NTOC, GA;  and Scott Myers, former Navy Information Warfare Officer and  NSA veteran all add the cybersecurity expertise, strong leadership, and managerial depth to significantly improve our operational services and product development. 
Finally, to address the vulnerabilities that have damaged several of our nation's largest corporations, we have begun building an Adversary Pursuit Center in Colorado Springs which is expected to be fully operational in 90 days.  The Center will operate 24/7 and allow us to remotely access our client's proprietary network space with our trained operators.  The center will provide our clients with actionable threat intelligence, improve the efficacy of their existing passive capabilities and fuse internal client information with commercial data feeds to provide a more complete and accurate picture of the operational landscape.  
Our investments in root9B are starting to yield tangible results.  Recently we announced a $1.7 million government contract with Northcom and we are about to ink our first commercial contract for remote access through our HUNT platform with a Fortune 100 retail client.  However, the sales cycle has turned out to be longer than originally anticipated and many of our potential clients are requesting POC's to validate our paradigm changing approach to cybersecurity. This has added additional time to the sales cycle delaying the process by 90 to 120 days. We remain confident that our approach is correct, and we will receive continued recognition as a solution provider. We expect significant sales growth in 2015 in both the commercial and government sectors.  The commercial sector is beginning to realize that the traditional passive approach does not adequately protect against today's sophisticated state sponsored attacks and the increasing importance of Knowing Your Attacker (KYA) that root9B delivers. 
We also shored up our balance sheet with the completion of $7.3 million in financing with a leading financial institution and a $4 million PIPE.  A portion of the proceeds was used to fund the IPSA transaction, with the remaining funds earmarked for working capital and capital expenditures required to support growth.  With these foundational improvements, we are ready to focus our efforts on executing our vision and delivering the strategic growth plan.  We view 2015 as a turnaround year for the company.
These restructuring and acquisition events were time consuming, and their associated costs had a negative impact on our operating performance for the 2014 year, and will similarly impact results for the first quarter of 2015.  As disclosed in our Form 10K, revenues for the year were $20.2 million as compared to $26.4 million in 2013, the result of an $8.8 million sales decline at our Energy Solutions business and a $1.5 million sales decline at our Business Advisory segment.  Conversely, our Cyber Solutions business generated $4.1 million in revenue during 2014, almost all of which was incremental to 2013 as a result of the acquisition of root9B.  Our loss from operations rose to $7.6 million in 2014 from $4.0 million in 2013, due to a combination of lower revenues and expansion costs associated with the ramp up of our Cyber Solutions business.   In conjunction with our decision to de-emphasize the Energy Solutions business we incurred a charge for the full impairment of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets of $6.4 million.  I encourage you to review our Form 10-K for a more thorough discussion of our initiatives and results.
I am, however, pleased to say that today we are better positioned operationally and financially, and that our branding and business development activities, especially with respect to root9B, are beginning to gain traction.  With the acquisition of IPSA, the ongoing build-out of our cybersecurity business, and the complete recognition of one time transaction costs, we believe our growth strategies will begin to bear fruit in the second half of this year.  We expect Q1 results from operations to reflect a loss followed by a smaller loss in Q2 and and we anticipate profitable operations commencing during the second half of the year.  2014 was the year we made some tough decisions that cleared the way for the reorganization and restructuring that will support our future growth efforts.  We haven't turned the corner quite yet but we are confident that the plan is sound and that we are positioned properly. The markets have thus far responded favorably.  The management team and I believe that the first half of 2015 will further the transition and we are optimistic that we will achieve profitability this year.  We will continue to provide you with updates throughout this turnaround year and appreciate your continued support and belief in our efforts, vision and leadership.  
Respectfully,
Joseph J Grano, Jr.Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Whether leading draftees through combat as a Green Beret in Vietnam, regrouping a team of brokers during the market crash of 1987, or working tirelessly to reopen Wall Street after the attacks on 9/11, Joe has served at the front lines of our nation's most defining moments, leading and even inspiring others when things seem at their darkest.Structured around six specific crises he faced in his life and career, You Can't Predict a Hero will describe how Grano was able to triumph over challenges both personal and professional. Whether teaching himself to walk again after sustaining crippling battle wounds, rising from his hardscrabble beginnings to become a top broker at Merrill Lynch, or shepherding the merger of PaineWebber and UBS, his experience has been hard-won and his perspective like no one else's.Through it all, Grano has learned to find the opportunity in any crisis, how to calm and inspire those he leads, and how to find the real solution to what can appear as an insurmountable problem.This dynamic book will inspire anyone looking to make sense of our rapidly changing world, and how to grow and even thrive through any challenge.

Chairman and C.E.O. of Centurion Holdings, business strategy consultants, New York
AGE 61
HEROINE Margaret Thatcher
HOBBY Gourmet cooking




My immediate family moved several times and arrived in Wethersfield, Conn., my junior year in high school. One day, two friends and I skipped school and went to the beach. One of my friends was driving; in an accident, we were thrown from the car. I was taken to the hospital and released. After I hitchhiked home, blood collected between my retina and my cornea and I became blind in my left eye. I was back in the hospital for two weeks. The day the doctors were to operate, the blood began to recede and my vision returned. I had no other injuries, but I missed most of a semester and was tutored at home the rest of the year. When I returned as a senior, I was elected class president. In my yearbook I was voted most popular. In college, I was intending to be a math teacher. Instead I found myself skipping class and playing pool. After about three months, I said to some friends, “Why don’t we go do our part and fight in Vietnam?” This was 1967. I joined the Army, and after basic and advanced infantry training, I went to officer candidate school and was trained to be a Green Beret officer. I was sent to Panama for two years, then was posted to Vietnam as a captain.I was there eight months when I was ordered on patrol by a new battalion commander. The soldier in front of me tripped on a booby trap, which exploded. Three of us were injured, including me. The man in front lost an eye and a leg. The man behind me ultimately died of a heart wound.After 20 minutes I was airlifted to a field hospital in Chu Lai, then to Okinawa. A month later, I went to the military hospital at Fort Devens, Mass., with multiple broken bones. My left arm had been partly severed in the explosion and was in a long cast. I also had a cast on my left leg. My wife was about to give birth to our first child, but the doctors wouldn’t release me until I could walk. I persuaded some National Guardsmen to help me walk with a cane. I was discharged from the hospital nine days after I arrived, two weeks before our child’s birth. A month after leaving the hospital, I could walk 25 to 30 feet as a result of designing my own physical therapy. My doctors at Fort Devens told me I was doing more for myself than they could do for me. After six months, I was discharged with a 60 percent disability. Doctors told me I’d never be able to lift a milk bottle. They were wrong.While waiting to be discharged, I began selling real estate and saw an ad to become a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch. I limped into its Hartford branch office with my officer efficiency reports. I was sent to New York to take aptitude and psychological tests. The personnel office there advised me to go back to school or gain business experience. But the Hartford local manager recommended me to the New Haven office. I didn’t know anyone in the territory, but I took the job. After three years as a stockbroker, I was asked to head marketing. I rose through the ranks over the next 16 years. I was director of national sales when I left in 1988 to become president of PaineWebber. UBS acquired PaineWebber in 2000; I stayed on as chairman and C.E.O. of UBS PaineWebber until November 2004.I founded Centurion Holdings immediately upon my departure, as I was not then, and am not now, ready to retire. I have anger and sadness seeing financial companies melt down. I won’t forgive some of my friends for concentrating on risky investments and overleveraging. I have an immense conviction that you don’t need to keep up with the Joneses.  As told to Amy Zipkin.

Item Description: Times Group Books, New Delhi, India, 2010. Softcover. Book Condition: New. First Edition. This book describes how Grano was able to triumph over varied challenges. These challenges range from his time as a Green Beret combat leader in Vietnam to his shepherding the merger of PaineWebber and UBS. The book explores his historic tenures at both Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, dealing with the Crash of 1987 and the attacks of September 11. Also includes defining personal moments, such as Grano's overcoming a 60 percent disability from wounds and his battling through the collapse of a major investment. These six defining moments serves not just as the touchstones in a remarkable life story, but as six lessons in courage, leadership and determination that inspires readers of every age and at every stage in life.Printed Pages: 240.

Item Description: John Wiley and Sons Ltd, United Kingdom, 2009. Hardback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. The unique story of Wall Street legend Joe Grano-six defining moments in courage, leadership, and determination that will inspire readers of every age, and at every stage in life From Vietnam to 9/11, from the market crash of 87 to today s financial crisis, Wall Street legend Joe Grano has weathered the most defining crises of the last forty years. Whether leading draftees through combat as a Green Beret in Vietnam, regrouping a team of brokers during the market crash of 1987, or working tirelessly to reopen Wall Street after the attacks on 9/11, Joe has served at the front lines of our nation s most defining moments, leading and even inspiring others when things seem at their darkest. Structured around six specific crises he faced in his life and career, You Can t Predict a Hero will describe how Grano was able to triumph over challenges both personal and professional. Whether teaching himself to walk again after sustaining crippling battle wounds, rising from his hardscrabble beginnings to become a top broker at Merrill Lynch, or shepherding the merger of PaineWebber and UBS, his experience has been hard-won and his perspective like no one else s.Through it all, Grano has learned to find the opportunity in any crisis, how to calm and inspire those he leads, and how to find the real solution to what can appear as an insurmountable problem. This dynamic book will inspire anyone looking to make sense of our rapidly changing world, and how to grow and even thrive through any challenge. Problems require solutions, and crisis creates true leaders. Joseph J. Grano, Jr. is Chairman and CEO of Centurion Holdings LLC, a company that advises private and public companies. From 2001-2004, Grano was Chairman of UBS Financial Services Inc. (formerly UBS PaineWebber). Having joined the company in 1988, Grano is credited for turning PaineWebber around and shepherding its merger with Swiss banking giant UBS. Grano began his career as a stock broker at Merrill Lynch, where he rose to various senior management positions over 16 years. A decorated war hero, Grano was chosen by the White House to be chairman of the President s Homeland Security Advisory Council after 9/11, a position he held from 2002-2005.The recipient of countless awards for leadership, civic contributions, as well as honorary degrees, he is involved in a wide range of educational and philanthropic endeavors. He and his wife, Kathy, live in New Jersey. Mark Levine has written and collaborated on more than 30 books, including the best sellers Second Acts, Die Broke, and Lifescripts, as well as hundreds of magazine articles. He lives Ithaca, New York, and is a member of the Authors Guild.  Bookseller Inventory # AAH9780470411674

Maryann, New Jersey
