How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE19 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Ctfs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE19 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





August 06, 2014 04:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE19 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$69,931,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$168,679,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$15,824,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,344,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$283,135,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$911,443,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89,530,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,773,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$198,140,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,837,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$108,610,000a,c class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$64,579,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,483,000c class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 4, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $36,693,000 
      interest-only class X-C, the $52,837,569 interest-only class X-D, the 
      $13,210,000 class F, the $13,209,000 class G or the $39,628,569 class H 
      certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 69 loans secured by 85 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.17 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., German American Capital 
      Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, and Natixis Real Estate Capital 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 84.8%, and asset summary reviews on 91.2% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) of 1.16x and 107.7%, 
      respectively, are worse than the first-half 2014 averages of 1.19x and 
      105.6%.
    

      Pool Concentration: The pool is diverse by loan size and sponsor as 
      compared to average transactions from 2013 and first-half 2014, as 
      evidenced by a loan concentration index (LCI) of 277 and sponsor 
      concentration index (SCI) of 298. Also, the 10 largest loan exposures 
      represent 42.4% of the total pool balance, which is lower than the 
      average 2013 and first-half 2014 top-10 concentration of 54.5% and 
      52.5%, respectively.
    

      High Hotel Concentration: Hotel properties make up 20.8% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the 2013 and first-half 2014 averages of 14.7% and 
      13.3%, respectively. Hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower model.
    

      Above-Average Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades 
      of 'A-' or better to 10.6% of the pool by balance (13.8% of properties 
      inspected by Fitch), including two of the five largest loans in the 
      pool. Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better were 
      assigned to 35.4% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 20.1% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-CCRE19 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly above 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 83 - 84.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National 
      Association, rated 'CSS1'.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations reflect the stable performance of the underlying collateral pool since issuance. As of the July 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1.8% to $1.154 billion from $1.174 billion at issuance. Four loans (2.2% of the pool) are considered Fitch Loans of Concern, one of which is a specially serviced loan (0.4% of the pool).The specially serviced loan is secured by Pheasant Ridge II Apartments; a 42 unit apartment community built in 2013 and located in Watford City, ND in the Bakken Shale region. The loan transferred to the special servicer in February 2016 due to payment default. Property operations have been impacted by the oil crisis and there has been a severe decline in occupancy at the property. Occupancy declined to 29% as of April 2016, which is down from 50% as of year-end (YE) 2015 and 100% as of YE 2014. Net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.41x, 1.74x, and 2.40x as of year-to-date (YTD) April 2016, YE 2015, and YE 2014, respectively. The special servicer is working with counsel to seek the appointment of a receiver. Due to the size of the loan relative to the pool, Fitch anticipates impact in the event of loss to be minimal. Fitch will continue to monitor.The largest loan in the pool (6.6% of the pool) is Bridgepoint Tower, a 273,764 square foot (sf) LEED-certified office building located in San Diego, CA. The 11-story tower was constructed in 2008 and is 100% occupied by Bridgepoint Education, Inc. (expiration February 2020). The sponsor developed the property as a multitenant property in 2008. Bridgepoint originally occupied 10 of 11 floors but ultimately expanded to take occupancy of the entire building. Performance has remained stable since issuance with a 2.15x NOI DSCR as of YE 2015.The second largest loan in the pool (5.5% of the pool) is The Shoppes at Webb Gin, a 358,254 sf open air retail center consisting of 10 buildings located in Snellville, GA (metro Atlanta). The property has two anchors including Sprouts Farmers Market (7.3% net rentable area [NRA], expiration September 2029) and Barnes & Noble (7.4% NRA, expiration January 2019). Performance is stable with occupancy at 79% (in-line with issuance) and a 1.91x NOI DSCR as of YE 2015.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Stable Outlooks reflect stable pool performance since issuance. Due to the recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the 'COMM 2014-CCRE19 Mortgage Trust' (Aug. 6, 2014) Presale report, available at www.fitchratings.com.DUE DILIGENCE USAGENo third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings as indicated:--$49.3 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$168.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$15.8 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$94.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$190 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$283.1 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$890,816,932a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$108,610,000a class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$89.5b million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$55.8b million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$52.8b million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$198.1b million class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$64.6 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$23.5 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.aNotional amount and interest only.bClass A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, B, and C certificates.Fitch does not rate the class F, G, and H certificates or the interest-only X-C and X-D certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Read MoreApplicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884963Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=873395Related ResearchCOMM 2014-CCRE19 Mortgage Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=756587Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1009673Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1009673Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Approximately $821.9 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, August 06, 2014 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned provisional ratings to six classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by COMM 2014-CCRE19 Mortgage Trust, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates. 




Cl. A-1, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-5, Assigned (P)Aaa (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 69 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 85 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and the 
structure of the transaction. This pool also contains two loans 
with structure credit assessment that comprise approximately 6.4% 
of the pool balance.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.45x (1.52x excluding 
structure credit assessed loans) is higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's Stressed 
DSCR of .95X(1.01X excluding structure credit assessed loans) 
is slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 
0.92X.




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 112.9% (115.6% 
excluding structured credit assessed loans), which is higher than 
the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% and 
higher than many pools securitized during 2013. There are six loans 
in the pool with additional/subordinate debt in the form of mezzanine 
debt. Including the in-place mezzanine debt the Moody's 
total debt LTV ratio rises to 116.4% ( 117.6% 
excluding structure credit assessed loans). 




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach.




With respect to loan level diversity, the pool's loan level (includes 
cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index is 34.4 
(35.4 excluding structured credit assessed loans). The transaction's 
loan level diversity is at the higher end of the band of Herfindahl scores 
found in most multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property level 
Herfindahl Index is 36.4 (38.9 excluding structured credit 
assessed loans). The transaction's property diversity profile is 
higher than the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions 
issued since 2009.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.36 (2.38 excluding credit 
assessed loans), which is weaker than the indices calculated in 
most multi-borrower transactions since 2009.




This deal has a super-senior Aaa class with 30% credit enhancement. 
Although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate 
holders provides additional protection against pool loss, the super-senior 
structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. The transaction was structured with additional subordination 
at class A-M to mitigate the potential increased severity to class 
A-M.




The methodologies used in this rating were "Moody's Approach to Rating 
U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 2000, 
and "Moody's Approach to Rating Fusion U.S. 
CMBS Transactions" published in April 2005. Please see the 
Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these 
methodologies.




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v2.64 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity. Moody's analysis 
also uses the CMBS IO calculator version 1.0 which references the 
following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published 
methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit estimates; 
original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds 
the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding 
to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
15%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated senior Aaa class would be Aaa, Aa1, 
Aa2, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES






For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account a third-party assessment 
on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial 
instruments in this transaction and the assessment had a neutral impact 
on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF376627.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE19 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE19
    





July 28, 2016 05:56 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE19 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations reflect the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool since issuance. As of the July 2016 distribution date, 
      the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1.8% to 
      $1.154 billion from $1.174 billion at issuance. Four loans (2.2% of the 
      pool) are considered Fitch Loans of Concern, one of which is a specially 
      serviced loan (0.4% of the pool).
    

      The specially serviced loan is secured by Pheasant Ridge II Apartments; 
      a 42 unit apartment community built in 2013 and located in Watford City, 
      ND in the Bakken Shale region. The loan transferred to the special 
      servicer in February 2016 due to payment default. Property operations 
      have been impacted by the oil crisis and there has been a severe decline 
      in occupancy at the property. Occupancy declined to 29% as of April 
      2016, which is down from 50% as of year-end (YE) 2015 and 100% as of YE 
      2014. Net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 
      0.41x, 1.74x, and 2.40x as of year-to-date (YTD) April 2016, YE 2015, 
      and YE 2014, respectively. The special servicer is working with counsel 
      to seek the appointment of a receiver. Due to the size of the loan 
      relative to the pool, Fitch anticipates impact in the event of loss to 
      be minimal. Fitch will continue to monitor.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (6.6% of the pool) is Bridgepoint Tower, a 
      273,764 square foot (sf) LEED-certified office building located in San 
      Diego, CA. The 11-story tower was constructed in 2008 and is 100% 
      occupied by Bridgepoint Education, Inc. (expiration February 2020). The 
      sponsor developed the property as a multitenant property in 2008. 
      Bridgepoint originally occupied 10 of 11 floors but ultimately expanded 
      to take occupancy of the entire building. Performance has remained 
      stable since issuance with a 2.15x NOI DSCR as of YE 2015.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool (5.5% of the pool) is The Shoppes at 
      Webb Gin, a 358,254 sf open air retail center consisting of 10 buildings 
      located in Snellville, GA (metro Atlanta). The property has two anchors 
      including Sprouts Farmers Market (7.3% net rentable area [NRA], 
      expiration September 2029) and Barnes & Noble (7.4% NRA, expiration 
      January 2019). Performance is stable with occupancy at 79% (in-line with 
      issuance) and a 1.91x NOI DSCR as of YE 2015.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Stable Outlooks reflect stable pool performance since issuance. Due 
      to the recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch 
      does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material 
      economic or asset level event changes the transaction's overall 
      portfolio-level metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is 
      available in the 'COMM 2014-CCRE19 Mortgage Trust' (Aug. 6, 2014) 
      Presale report, available at www.fitchratings.com.

      this rating action.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

Quicken Loans Ranks Highest in Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction for Seventh Consecutive Year


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 10 Nov. 2016 — Overall satisfaction scores have increased year over year, but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study,SM released today.The study shows that 21% of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender, and 27% of first-time home buyers regret their choice. Among customers who regret their decision, there are two distinct situations.The first situation is customers having a poor experience (overall scores below 600 on a 1,000-point scale), which includes an above-average incidence of problems, lack of communication and unmet promises. While this group’s responses aren’t unexpected, they are often vocal about their displeasure, making an average of 9.0 negative comments, compared with the study average of 0.7.The second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high. This group tends to be very price-focused and frequently obtains multiple quotes. Among customers who regret their lender selection, 72% indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product. Their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons, such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm (e.g., checking account with direct deposit).“This ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear,” said Craig Martin, director of the mortgage practice at J.D. Power. “Like a lot of consumers, they are happy with a good deal, but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal. In the end, they may not fully understand exactly what they got, and the longer-term risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future.”One potential contributing factor to this condition could be TRID (TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure[1]).  Over the past two years, much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements, which became effective in October 2015. Lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction. While various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process, findings of the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study show little change in the perceived speed of the process. Improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions.“Whether it is a new regulation, shifting rates or new technology, lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change,” Martin said. “Regardless of what comes, if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers.”Following are some of the key findings in this year’s study:A higher percentage of customers in 2016 indicate their loan representative always called back when promised, compared with last year (85% vs. 81%, respectively), and their loan closed on the desired date (81% vs. 79%).Satisfaction is significantly higher among customers buying a home (840) than among those refinancing (821). In the 2014 and 2015 studies, the levels of satisfaction in these groups were nearly identical.Technology is becoming increasingly important, with 28% of customers indicating they completed their detailed application online, up from 22% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. Study RankingsQuicken Loans ranks highest in primary mortgage origination satisfaction for a seventh consecutive year, with a score of 869. Quicken Loans performs particularly well in the application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; and onboarding factors.CitiMortgage moves up three positions from fifth in 2015 to second this year, with a score of 851.  Ditech Financial, new to the study in 2016, ranks third with a score of 849.Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (+52 points) and Nationstar Mortgage (+50 points) post the most significant year-over-year improvements in overall satisfaction.Advice to ConsumersPlan ahead when researching mortgage options. Satisfaction among customers who wait until they find a home to look into mortgage options is 92 points lower than among those who look into mortgage options before their home search.Take the time to obtain more than one quote. Among the 32% of customers who received just one quote, overall satisfaction is 19 points lower than those who get multiple quotes. Satisfaction is 38 points lower among first-time buyers only getting one quote vs. those who get multiple quotes.Choose a lender based on their merits, not just price or affiliation. Customers who say they chose their lender primarily because of price/rate or based on the recommendation of a realtor/builder are significantly less satisfied than those whose choice is based on other reasons.About the StudyThe 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study measures customer satisfaction with the mortgage origination experience in six factors (listed alphabetically): application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; onboarding; and problem resolution. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.The study is based on responses from 5,182 customers who originated a new mortgage or refinanced within the past 12 months, and was fielded in July–August 2016.For more information about the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, visithttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-primary-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
