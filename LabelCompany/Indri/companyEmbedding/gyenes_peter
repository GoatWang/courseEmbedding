Data Analytics Industry Leader Peter Gyenes Joins EnerNOC Board of Directors

BOSTON, April 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EnerNOC, Inc. (Nasdaq:ENOC), a leading provider of energy intelligence software, today announced the appointment of Peter Gyenes to its Board of Directors. Mr. Gyenes served as Chairman and CEO of data integration software company Ascential and its predecessor companies VMark Software, Ardent Software, and Informix from 1996 until its acquisition by IBM in 2005. He previously served as President and CEO of Racal InterLan, Inc., and in executive management positions at Data General 
Corporation, Encore Computer Corporation, and Prime Computer, Inc. Earlier in his career, Gyenes held sales and technical positions at Xerox Data Systems and IBM.


 "Peter has been a recognized leader in the software industry for many years. We're fortunate to have someone with such a long view of the industry's evolution, vision for where it's going, and track record of leading software companies successfully and profitably through all stages of growth," said Tim Healy, Chairman and CEO of EnerNOC.


 Gyenes brings to EnerNOC significant software company board experience. He currently serves as the Lead Independent Director of Sophos plc, a global security software firm that he joined as non-executive chairman in 2006. He also serves on the boards of Intralinks, Inc. (NYSE:IL), a provider of enterprise content management and collaboration software; Pegasystems Inc. (Nasdaq:PEGA), a provider of software that automates enterprise operations; RealPage Inc. (Nasdaq:RP), a provider of web based property management software; and VistaPrint N.V. (Nasdaq:VPRT), an online global provider of marketing products and services to 
small businesses. He also serves on several privately-held technology companies, and as a Trustee Emeritus of the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council. Mr. Gyenes previously served on the board of directors of webMethods Inc. (acquired by Software AG Darmstadt) from 2005 to 2007; Applix, Inc. (acquired by Cognos, Inc.) from 2000 to 2007; and BladeLogic, Inc. (acquired by BMC Software, Inc.) from 2006 to 2008. In 2005, Gyenes was awarded the 2005 New England Region Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in Software. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and an MBA from Columbia University. He brings over four decades of technology experience to the EnerNOC Board spanning sales, marketing, technical, and general management roles within the global 
software and computer industries.


 "I've been involved in the maturation of the high tech industry — especially as it relates to software, data integration and enterprise solutions — from a variety of vantage points.  I plan to leverage that experience to help EnerNOC expand its reach into the enterprise," said Gyenes. "EnerNOC is the definitive leader in energy intelligence software, and I look forward to working with the current board and executive team to continue creating value in this category."

    24 May 2006               


    Peter Gyenes, former CEO of Ascential, joins Sophos board of directors as non-executive chairman
        

    New non-executive chairman brings growth and value-creation experience to Sophos's  vision for integrated threat management leadership
        






Peter Gyenes.
Lynnfield, MA - Sophos, a world leader in integrated threat management, which protects millions of business users around the world from viruses, spyware, hacking, spam and email policy abuse, has announced the appointment of Peter Gyenes to the role of non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Gyenes, based in Massachusetts, was most recently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ascential Software Corporation (NASDAQ: ASCL), until its acquisition by IBM in April 2005. He directed the development and growth of Ascential Software from a small niche software business in 1996 ($50M market value) to the market leader in data integration software ($1.1B market value), through product and strategy differentiation, organic growth and strategic M&A, technology innovation and rigorous execution focus. Gyenes brings to Sophos four decades of experience in technical, sales, marketing and general management positions within the computer systems and software industry in the Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific.
"Sophos has created a strong market position with thousands of customers and partners around the globe in the strategically critical domain of end-point security solutions," said Peter Gyenes.

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]
