Timeline

Learn about memorable moments in the evolution of Michael J. Devlin


FORTIES


2011

Age 45





On April 9, 2011, during breakfast at the dining hall of Crossroads Correctional Center, Devlin was stabbed several times with two "ice picks" by another inmate in protective custody, Troy L. Fenton, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and for shooting a police officer.
More Details
Hide Details
Corrections officers spotted the assault and ordered Fenton to stop. He complied by dropping to the ground on his stomach. Devlin received several wounds and was briefly treated in a hospital and returned to the prison.
 According to prison officials, Fenton had made the "ice picks" from metal guide bars on his typewriter. He was cited for having a 15-inch sharpened steel rod, complete with a plastic handle, hidden under his pillow in his cell. Fenton said he was motivated to attack out of anger at Devlin's crimes. Investigation of the assault is ongoing and Fenton may face charges related to the attack. Devlin's security has been a concern for state prison officials since his arrest. Officials contemplated sending him out of state or providing him with a new identity. However, some victims' family members objected to the move, and the plan was dropped.





2008

Age 42





Devlin was transferred to the Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri, to begin serving the first of his life sentences on January 30, 2008.
More Details
Hide Details






2007

Age 41





In a January 2007 interview with The New York Post, Devlin was quoted as saying "I don't know how I'm going to explain myself to my parents."
More Details
Hide Details
During the same interview he claimed to have been happy while Hornbeck lived with him, and lonely prior to that, since most of his friends had gotten married and disappeared.
 On February 5, St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch added 71 new felony charges to the existing charges previously filed by Washington and Franklin County Prosecutors. The first 18 counts (one count of kidnapping and 17 counts of forcible sodomy) pertain to the 2007 abduction. The remaining 53 charges are kidnapping and forcible sodomy charges related to the 2002 abduction of Hornbeck. Each of these individual counts was a felony and carried the possibility of life in prison.
 On February 6, a motion by Devlin's attorneys, Ethan Corlija and Michael Kielty, for a gag order against the New York Post and reporter Susannah Cahalan was denied in Franklin County Court. Franklin County Associate Circuit Judge David Tobben also denied a motion for her to turn over her notes to the attorneys, and denied or refused to immediately hear two other requests by Devlin's attorneys.



On January 18, 2007, Devlin pleaded not guilty via closed circuit television on the charges of child kidnapping.
More Details
Hide Details
Prosecutors in the case said Devlin had already confessed. He was held at the Franklin County Sheriff's Department on a $1 million cash-only bail. He also had a $3 million bond in Washington County.





THIRTIES


2002

Age 36





The two boys were discovered after police noticed Devlin's white pickup truck, which matched the description of a vehicle in the vicinity of the 2002 abduction, in the parking lot of his apartment complex.
More Details
Hide Details
They happened to be there to serve an unrelated arrest warrant. Hornbeck lived with Devlin, who presented the boy as his son. He was separated from his family for a total of four years, three months and six days, during which time the Shawn Hornbeck Foundation and Search and Rescue Team were established. Both boys were reunited with their families after their discovery.
 Soon after Devlin's arrest, prosecutors and investigators from Washington, Franklin, St. Louis and Lincoln counties, along with the FBI, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and Kirkwood and St. Charles police, formed a task force to investigate Devlin's possible involvement in other unsolved cases.
 Devlin, who had no criminal record at the time, was charged with one count of kidnapping in Franklin County, Missouri, as well as one count of kidnapping and armed criminal action in Washington County.



He had disappeared on October 6, 2002, at age 11 while riding his bike to a friend's house in Richwoods, Missouri.
More Details
Hide Details
No one had heard from him until he was discovered in Devlin's apartment.



He had changed "to a much quieter person" after he developed diabetes and had two toes amputated in 2002.
More Details
Hide Details
On January 12, 2007, Devlin was taken into custody and charged with the abduction four days earlier of 13-year-old William Benjamin Ownby, whom police found that day. At the time of his discovery, law enforcement officials found another missing boy, Shawn Hornbeck.

Betsy - I met you and Mike a few years ago at some horse event in Millbrook - quite possibly Fitch's Corner or Coole Park?  I simply can't recall.  
But what I shall never forget was the amazing gift that Mike had of engaging people (myself included) in conversation and making them feel the complete center of attention.
It was truly a small world to meet the two of you, from NC also, and to enjoy discussing all the things that were familiar and lovely about NC - while in the heart of Dutchess County.  
And true to his word, Mike never failed to periodically send an email with updates on all things at the gallery, travel, etc.  We must have spoken for the better part of an hour about travel (I run an equestrian travel company), Africa (also one of my favorite destinations) and just the love of life.
I'm a bit "late to the party" with regard to Mike leaving the "party of life", but nevertheless, what I saw briefly of the two of you and your wonderful relationship was absolutely splendid.  You both are very lucky to have each other and to have shared your lives.
My heart goes out to you and even at this late date, I wish you happiness and years of re-living the memories.  It was truly a pleasure to make both of your acquaintances.
Very best to you.
Stacey
