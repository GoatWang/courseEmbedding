Description

    Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues, Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.

At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.  

Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.

Synopsis
About this title




Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîas well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîWalter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.¬†¬† Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.¬†His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple‚Äôs hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.

Review:
                                                Amazon Best Books of the¬†Month, November 2011: It is difficult to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson‚Äôs Steve Jobs without feeling melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs‚Äôs focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. --Chris Schluep  Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Walter Isaacson   Q: It's becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it?  Isaacson: Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things. Q: How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk?  Isaacson: I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained. Q: He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk?  Isaacson: Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be. Q: Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs' contradictions contribute to his success? Isaacson: Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology.  Q: Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end?  Isaacson: Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired.  Q: Do you believe he was a genius?  Isaacson: He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers. Q: Did he have regrets?  Isaacson: He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family. Q: What do you think is his legacy? Isaacson: His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his "Think Different" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

Description



Product Description
Following his blockbuster biography of Steve Jobs, The Innovators is Walter Isaacson‚Äôs revealing story of the people who created the computer and the Internet. It is destined to be the standard history of the digital revolution and an indispensable guide to how innovation really happens.
What were the talents that allowed certain inventors and entrepreneurs to turn their visionary ideas into disruptive realities? What led to their creative leaps? Why did some succeed and others fail?
In his masterly saga, Isaacson begins with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron‚Äôs daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. He explores the fascinating personalities that created our current digital revolution, such as Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, J.C.R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, Tim Berners-Lee, and Larry Page.
This is the story of how their minds worked and what made them so inventive. It‚Äôs also a narrative of how their ability to collaborate and master the art of teamwork made them even more creative.
Signed, 1st ed.
Walter joined us on Virtual Book Signing in December, 2014. Watch the program.

Overview



Walter Isaacson‚Äôs ‚Äúenthralling‚Äù (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs‚Äîthe inspiration for the movie Steve Jobs starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîas well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîWalter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson‚Äôs portrait touched millions of readers.At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against.His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.

Editorial Reviews


Janet Maslin
[Jobs's] story calls for a book that is clear, elegant and concise enough to qualify as an iBio. Mr. Isaacson's Steve Jobs does its solid best to hit that target‚Ä¶[It] greatly admires its subject. But its most adulatory passages are not about people. Offering a combination of tech criticism and promotional hype, Mr. Isaacson describes the arrival of each new product right down to Mr. Jobs's theatrical introductions and the advertising campaigns. But if the individual bits of hoopla seem excessive, their cumulative effect is staggering. Here is an encyclopedic survey of all that Mr. Jobs accomplished, replete with the passion and excitement that it deserves.¬óThe New York Times

Michael S. Rosenwald
Isaacson's biography can be read in several ways. It is on the one hand a history of the most exciting time in the age of computers, when the machines first became personal and later, fashionable accessories. It is also a textbook study of the rise and fall and rise of Apple and the brutal clashes that destroyed friendships and careers. And it is a gadget lover's dream, with fabulous, inside accounts of how the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone and iPad came into being. But more than anything, Isaacson has crafted a biography of a complicated, peculiar personality¬óJobs was charming, loathsome, lovable, obsessive, maddening¬óand the author shows how Jobs's character was instrumental in shaping some of the greatest technological innovations of our time.¬óThe Washington Post

Publishers Weekly
If not the greatest of computer moguls, the late Apple Computer co-founder was certainly the most colorful and charismatic to judge by this compelling biography. Journalist Isaacson (Albert Einstein) had his subject's intimate cooperation but doesn't shy away from Jobs's off-putting traits: the egomania; the shameless theft of ideas; the "reality distortion field" of lies and delusions; the veering between manipulative charm and cold betrayal; the bullying rages, profanity and weeping; the bizarre vegetarian diets that he believed would ward off body odor and cancer (he was tragically wrong on both counts). Isaacson also sees the constructive flip-side of Jobs's flaws, arguing that his crazed perfectionism and sublime sense of design‚Äîhe wanted even his computers' circuit boards to be visually elegant‚Äîbegat brilliant innovations, from the Mac to the iPad, that blended "poetry and processors." The author oversells Jobs as the digital artiste pitting well-crafted, vertically integrated personal computing experiences against the promiscuously licensed, bulk-commodity software profferred by his Microsoft rival Bill Gates. (Gates's acerbic commentary on Jobs's romanticism often steals the page.) Still, Isaacson's exhaustively researched but well-paced, candid and gripping narrative gives us a great warts-and-all portrait of an entrepreneurial spirit‚Äîand one of the best accounts yet of the human side of the computer biz. Photos. (Oct. 24)

Kirkus Reviews
An unforgettable tale of a one-of-a-kind visionary. With a unique ability to meld arts and technology and an uncanny understanding of consumers' desires, Apple founder Steve Jobs (1955‚Äì2011) played a major role in transforming not just computer technology, but a variety of industries. When Jobs died earlier this month, the outpouring of emotion from the general public was surprisingly intense. His creations, which he knew we wanted before we did, were more than mere tools; everything from the iPod to the MacBook Pro touched us on a gut level and became an integral part of our lives. This was why those of us who were hip to Steve Jobs the Inventor were so moved when he passed. However, those who had an in-depth knowledge of Steve Jobs the Businessman might not have taken such a nostalgic view of his life. According to acclaimed biographer and Aspen Institute CEO Isaacson (American Sketches: Great Leaders, Creative Thinkers, and a Heroes of a Hurricane, 2009, etc.) in this consistently engaging, warts-and-all biography, Jobs was not necessarily the most pleasant boss. We learn about Jobs' predilection for humiliating his co-workers into their best performances; his habit of profanely dismissing an underling's idea, only to claim it as his own later; and his ability to manipulate a situation with an evangelical, fact-mangling technique that friends and foes alike referred to as his "reality distortion field." But we also learn how--through his alternative education, his pilgrimage to India, a heap of acid trips and a fateful meeting with engineering genius Steve Wozniak--Jobs became Jobs and Apple became Apple. Though the narrative could have used a tighter edit in a few places, Isaacson's portrait of this complex, often unlikable genius is, to quote Jobs, insanely great. Jobs was an American original, and Isaacson's impeccably researched, vibrant biography--fully endorsed by his subject--does his legacy proud.

Read an Excerpt


Steve Jobs  Abandoned and Chosen When Paul Jobs was mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a wager with his crewmates. They had arrived in San Francisco, where their ship was decommissioned, and Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was a taut, tattooed engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a passing resemblance to James Dean. But it wasn‚Äôt his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored daughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a car, unlike the group she had originally planned to go out with that evening. Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It would turn out to be a happy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them more than forty years later.Paul Reinhold Jobs had been raised on a dairy farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Even though his father was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a gentle and calm disposition under his leathery exterior. After dropping out of high school, he wandered through the Midwest picking up work as a mechanic until, at age nineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even though he didn‚Äôt know how to swim. He was deployed on the USS General M. C. Meigs and spent much of the war ferrying troops to Italy for General Patton. His talent as a machinist and fireman earned him commendations, but he occasionally found himself in minor trouble and never rose above the rank of seaman.Clara was born in New Jersey, where her parents had landed after fleeing the Turks in Armenia, and they moved to the Mission District of San Francisco when she was a child. She had a secret that she rarely mentioned to anyone: She had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. So when she met Paul Jobs on that first date, she was primed to start a new life.Like many who lived through the war, they had experienced enough excitement that, when it was over, they desired simply to settle down, raise a family, and lead a less eventful life. They had little money, so they moved to Wisconsin and lived with Paul‚Äôs parents for a few years, then headed for Indiana, where he got a job as a machinist for International Harvester. His passion was tinkering with old cars, and he made money in his spare time buying, restoring, and selling them. Eventually he quit his day job to become a full-time used car salesman.Clara, however, loved San Francisco, and in 1952 she convinced her husband to move back there. They got an apartment in the Sunset District facing the Pacific, just south of Golden Gate Park, and he took a job working for a finance company as a ‚Äúrepo man,‚Äù picking the locks of cars whose owners hadn‚Äôt paid their loans and repossessing them. He also bought, repaired, and sold some of the cars, making a decent enough living in the process.There was, however, something missing in their lives. They wanted children, but Clara had suffered an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg was implanted in a fallopian tube rather than the uterus, and she had been unable to have any. So by 1955, after nine years of marriage, they were looking to adopt a child.‚Ä¢¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†‚Ä¢Like Paul Jobs, Joanne Schieble was from a rural Wisconsin family of German heritage. Her father, Arthur Schieble, had immigrated to the outskirts of Green Bay, where he and his wife owned a mink farm and dabbled successfully in various other businesses, including real estate and photoengraving. He was very strict, especially regarding his daughter‚Äôs relationships, and he had strongly disapproved of her first love, an artist who was not a Catholic. Thus it was no surprise that he threatened to cut Joanne off completely when, as a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, she fell in love with Abdulfattah ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù Jandali, a Muslim teaching assistant from Syria.Jandali was the youngest of nine children in a prominent Syrian family. His father owned oil refineries and multiple other businesses, with large holdings in Damascus and Homs, and at one point pretty much controlled the price of wheat in the region. His mother, he later said, was a ‚Äútraditional Muslim woman‚Äù who was a ‚Äúconservative, obedient housewife.‚Äù Like the Schieble family, the Jandalis put a premium on education. Abdulfattah was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, even though he was Muslim, and he got an undergraduate degree at the American University in Beirut before entering the University of Wisconsin to pursue a doctoral degree in political science.In the summer of 1954, Joanne went with Abdulfattah to Syria. They spent two months in Homs, where she learned from his family to cook Syrian dishes. When they returned to Wisconsin she discovered that she was pregnant. They were both twenty-three, but they decided not to get married. Her father was dying at the time, and he had threatened to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah. Nor was abortion an easy option in a small Catholic community. So in early 1955, Joanne traveled to San Francisco, where she was taken into the care of a kindly doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions.Joanne had one requirement: Her child must be adopted by college graduates. So the doctor arranged for the baby to be placed with a lawyer and his wife. But when a boy was born‚Äîon February 24, 1955‚Äîthe designated couple decided that they wanted a girl and backed out. Thus it was that the boy became the son not of a lawyer but of a high school dropout with a passion for mechanics and his salt-of-the-earth wife who was working as a bookkeeper. Paul and Clara named their new baby Steven Paul Jobs.When Joanne found out that her baby had been placed with a couple who had not even graduated from high school, she refused to sign the adoption papers. The standoff lasted weeks, even after the baby had settled into the Jobs household. Eventually Joanne relented, with the stipulation that the couple promise‚Äîindeed sign a pledge‚Äîto fund a savings account to pay for the boy‚Äôs college education.There was another reason that Joanne was balky about signing the adoption papers. Her father was about to die, and she planned to marry Jandali soon after. She held out hope, she would later tell family members, sometimes tearing up at the memory, that once they were married, she could get their baby boy back.Arthur Schieble died in August 1955, after the adoption was finalized. Just after Christmas that year, Joanne and Abdulfattah were married in St. Philip the Apostle Catholic Church in Green Bay. He got his PhD in international politics the next year, and then they had another child, a girl named Mona. After she and Jandali divorced in 1962, Joanne embarked on a dreamy and peripatetic life that her daughter, who grew up to become the acclaimed novelist Mona Simpson, would capture in her book Anywhere but Here. Because Steve‚Äôs adoption had been closed, it would be twenty years before they would all find each other.‚Ä¢¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†‚Ä¢Steve Jobs knew from an early age that he was adopted. ‚ÄúMy parents were very open with me about that,‚Äù he recalled. He had a vivid memory of sitting on the lawn of his house, when he was six or seven years old, telling the girl who lived across the street. ‚ÄúSo does that mean your real parents didn‚Äôt want you?‚Äù the girl asked. ‚ÄúLightning bolts went off in my head,‚Äù according to Jobs. ‚ÄúI remember running into the house, crying. And my parents said, ‚ÄòNo, you have to understand.‚Äô They were very serious and looked me straight in the eye. They said, ‚ÄòWe specifically picked you out.‚Äô Both of my parents said that and repeated it slowly for me. And they put an emphasis on every word in that sentence.‚ÄùAbandoned. Chosen. Special. Those concepts became part of who Jobs was and how he regarded himself. His closest friends think that the knowledge that he was given up at birth left some scars. ‚ÄúI think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and the fact that he was abandoned at birth,‚Äù said one longtime colleague, Del Yocam. ‚ÄúHe wants to control his environment, and he sees the product as an extension of himself.‚Äù Greg Calhoun, who became close to Jobs right after college, saw another effect. ‚ÄúSteve talked to me a lot about being abandoned and the pain that caused,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt made him independent. He followed the beat of a different drummer, and that came from being in a different world than he was born into.‚ÄùLater in life, when he was the same age his biological father had been when he abandoned him, Jobs would father and abandon a child of his own. (He eventually took responsibility for her.) Chrisann Brennan, the mother of that child, said that being put up for adoption left Jobs ‚Äúfull of broken glass,‚Äù and it helps to explain some of his behavior. ‚ÄúHe who is abandoned is an abandoner,‚Äù she said. Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Jobs at Apple in the early 1980s, is among the few who remained close to both Brennan and Jobs. ‚ÄúThe key question about Steve is why he can‚Äôt control himself at times from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat goes back to being abandoned at birth. The real underlying problem was the theme of abandonment in Steve‚Äôs life.‚ÄùJobs dismissed this. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some notion that because I was abandoned, I worked very hard so I could do well and make my parents wish they had me back, or some such nonsense, but that‚Äôs ridiculous,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúKnowing I was adopted may have made me feel more independent, but I have never felt abandoned. I‚Äôve always felt special. My parents made me feel special.‚Äù He would later bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his ‚Äúadoptive‚Äù parents or implied that they were not his ‚Äúreal‚Äù parents. ‚ÄúThey were my parents 1,000%,‚Äù he said. When speaking about his biological parents, on the other hand, he was curt: ‚ÄúThey were my sperm and egg bank. That‚Äôs not harsh, it‚Äôs just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.‚Äù The childhood that Paul and Clara Jobs created for their new son was, in many ways, a stereotype of the late 1950s. When Steve was two they adopted a girl they named Patty, and three years later they moved to a tract house in the suburbs. The finance company where Paul worked as a repo man, CIT, had transferred him down to its Palo Alto office, but he could not afford to live there, so they landed in a subdivision in Mountain View, a less expensive town just to the south.There Paul tried to pass along his love of mechanics and cars. ‚ÄúSteve, this is your workbench now,‚Äù he said as he marked off a section of the table in their garage. Jobs remembered being impressed by his father‚Äôs focus on craftsmanship. ‚ÄúI thought my dad‚Äôs sense of design was pretty good,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbecause he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him.‚ÄùFifty years later the fence still surrounds the back and side yards of the house in Mountain View. As Jobs showed it off to me, he caressed the stockade panels and recalled a lesson that his father implanted deeply in him. It was important, his father said, to craft the backs of cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden. ‚ÄúHe loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn‚Äôt see.‚ÄùHis father continued to refurbish and resell used cars, and he festooned the garage with pictures of his favorites. He would point out the detailing of the design to his son: the lines, the vents, the chrome, the trim of the seats. After work each day, he would change into his dungarees and retreat to the garage, often with Steve tagging along. ‚ÄúI figured I could get him nailed down with a little mechanical ability, but he really wasn‚Äôt interested in getting his hands dirty,‚Äù Paul later recalled. ‚ÄúHe never really cared too much about mechanical things.‚Äù‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt that into fixing cars,‚Äù Jobs admitted. ‚ÄúBut I was eager to hang out with my dad.‚Äù Even as he was growing more aware that he had been adopted, he was becoming more attached to his father. One day when he was about eight, he discovered a photograph of his father from his time in the Coast Guard. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the engine room, and he‚Äôs got his shirt off and looks like James Dean. It was one of those Oh wow moments for a kid. Wow, oooh, my parents were actually once very young and really good-looking.‚ÄùThrough cars, his father gave Steve his first exposure to electronics. ‚ÄúMy dad did not have a deep understanding of electronics, but he‚Äôd encountered it a lot in automobiles and other things he would fix. He showed me the rudiments of electronics, and I got very interested in that.‚Äù Even more interesting were the trips to scavenge for parts. ‚ÄúEvery weekend, there‚Äôd be a junkyard trip. We‚Äôd be looking for a generator, a carburetor, all sorts of components.‚Äù He remembered watching his father negotiate at the counter. ‚ÄúHe was a good bargainer, because he knew better than the guys at the counter what the parts should cost.‚Äù This helped fulfill the pledge his parents made when he was adopted. ‚ÄúMy college fund came from my dad paying $50 for a Ford Falcon or some other beat-up car that didn‚Äôt run, working on it for a few weeks, and selling it for $250‚Äîand not telling the IRS.‚ÄùThe Jobses‚Äô house and the others in their neighborhood were modeled on ones built by the real estate developer Joseph Eichler, whose company spawned more than eleven thousand homes in various California subdivisions between 1950 and 1974. Inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs vision of simple modern homes for the American ‚Äúeveryman,‚Äù Eichler built inexpensive houses that featured floor-to-ceiling glass walls, open floor plans, exposed post-and-beam construction, concrete slab floors, and lots of sliding glass doors. ‚ÄúEichler did a great thing,‚Äù Jobs said on one of our walks around the neighborhood. ‚ÄúHis houses were smart and cheap and good. They brought clean design and simple taste to lower-income people. They had awesome little features, like radiant heating in the floors. You put carpet on them, and we had nice toasty floors when we were kids.‚ÄùJobs said that his appreciation for Eichler homes instilled in him a passion for making nicely designed products for the mass market. ‚ÄúI love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn‚Äôt cost much,‚Äù he said as he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. ‚ÄúIt was the original vision for Apple. That‚Äôs what we tried to do with the first Mac. That‚Äôs what we did with the iPod.‚ÄùAcross the street from the Jobs family lived a man who had become successful as a real estate agent. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt that bright,‚Äù Jobs recalled, ‚Äúbut he seemed to be making a fortune. So my dad thought, ‚ÄòI can do that.‚Äô He worked so hard, I remember. He took these night classes, passed the license test, and got into real estate. Then the bottom fell out of the market.‚Äù As a result, the family found itself financially strapped for a year or so while Steve was in elementary school. His mother took a job as a bookkeeper for Varian Associates, a company that made scientific instruments, and they took out a second mortgage. One day his fourth-grade teacher asked him, ‚ÄúWhat is it you don‚Äôt understand about the universe?‚Äù Jobs replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why all of a sudden my dad is so broke.‚Äù He was proud that his father never adopted a servile attitude or slick style that may have made him a better salesman. ‚ÄúYou had to suck up to people to sell real estate, and he wasn‚Äôt good at that and it wasn‚Äôt in his nature. I admired him for that.‚Äù Paul Jobs went back to being a mechanic.His father was calm and gentle, traits that his son later praised more than emulated. He was also resolute. Jobs described one example:Nearby was an engineer who was working at Westinghouse. He was a single guy, beatnik type. He had a girlfriend. She would babysit me sometimes. Both my parents worked, so I would come here right after school for a couple of hours. He would get drunk and hit her a couple of times. She came over one night, scared out of her wits, and he came over drunk, and my dad stood him down‚Äîsaying ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here, but you‚Äôre not coming in.‚Äù He stood right there. We like to think everything was idyllic in the 1950s, but this guy was one of those engineers who had messed-up lives.What made the neighborhood different from the thousands of other spindly-tree subdivisions across America was that even the ne‚Äôer-do-wells tended to be engineers. ‚ÄúWhen we moved here, there were apricot and plum orchards on all of these corners,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúBut it was beginning to boom because of military investment.‚Äù He soaked up the history of the valley and developed a yearning to play his own role. Edwin Land of Polaroid later told him about being asked by Eisenhower to help build the U-2 spy plane cameras to see how real the Soviet threat was. The film was dropped in canisters and returned to the NASA Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, not far from where Jobs lived. ‚ÄúThe first computer terminal I ever saw was when my dad brought me to the Ames Center,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI fell totally in love with it.‚ÄùOther defense contractors sprouted nearby during the 1950s. The Lockheed Missiles and Space Division, which built submarine-launched ballistic missiles, was founded in 1956 next to the NASA Center; by the time Jobs moved to the area four years later, it employed twenty thousand people. A few hundred yards away, Westinghouse built facilities that produced tubes and electrical transformers for the missile systems. ‚ÄúYou had all these military companies on the cutting edge,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúIt was mysterious and high-tech and made living here very exciting.‚ÄùIn the wake of the defense industries there arose a booming economy based on technology. Its roots stretched back to 1938, when David Packard and his new wife moved into a house in Palo Alto that had a shed where his friend Bill Hewlett was soon ensconced. The house had a garage‚Äîan appendage that would prove both useful and iconic in the valley‚Äîin which they tinkered around until they had their first product, an audio oscillator. By the 1950s, Hewlett-Packard was a fast-growing company making technical instruments.Fortunately there was a place nearby for entrepreneurs who had outgrown their garages. In a move that would help transform the area into the cradle of the tech revolution, Stanford University‚Äôs dean of engineering, Frederick Terman, created a seven-hundred-acre industrial park on university land for private companies that could commercialize the ideas of his students. Its first tenant was Varian Associates, where Clara Jobs worked. ‚ÄúTerman came up with this great idea that did more than anything to cause the tech industry to grow up here,‚Äù Jobs said. By the time Jobs was ten, HP had nine thousand employees and was the blue-chip company where every engineer seeking financial stability wanted to work.The most important technology for the region‚Äôs growth was, of course, the semiconductor. William Shockley, who had been one of the inventors of the transistor at Bell Labs in New Jersey, moved out to Mountain View and, in 1956, started a company to build transistors using silicon rather than the more expensive germanium that was then commonly used. But Shockley became increasingly erratic and abandoned his silicon transistor project, which led eight of his engineers‚Äîmost notably Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore‚Äîto break away to form Fairchild Semiconductor. That company grew to twelve thousand employees, but it fragmented in 1968, when Noyce lost a power struggle to become CEO. He took Gordon Moore and founded a company that they called Integrated Electronics Corporation, which they soon smartly abbreviated to Intel. Their third employee was Andrew Grove, who later would grow the company by shifting its focus from memory chips to microprocessors. Within a few years there would be more than fifty companies in the area making semiconductors.The exponential growth of this industry was correlated with the phenomenon famously discovered by Moore, who in 1965 drew a graph of the speed of integrated circuits, based on the number of transistors that could be placed on a chip, and showed that it doubled about every two years, a trajectory that could be expected to continue. This was reaffirmed in 1971, when Intel was able to etch a complete central processing unit onto one chip, the Intel 4004, which was dubbed a ‚Äúmicroprocessor.‚Äù Moore‚Äôs Law has held generally true to this day, and its reliable projection of performance to price allowed two generations of young entrepreneurs, including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, to create cost projections for their forward-leaning products.The chip industry gave the region a new name when Don Hoefler, a columnist for the weekly trade paper Electronic News, began a series in January 1971 entitled ‚ÄúSilicon Valley USA.‚Äù The forty-mile Santa Clara Valley, which stretches from South San Francisco through Palo Alto to San Jose, has as its commercial backbone El Camino Real, the royal road that once connected California‚Äôs twenty-one mission churches and is now a bustling avenue that connects companies and startups accounting for a third of the venture capital investment in the United States each year. ‚ÄúGrowing up, I got inspired by the history of the place,‚Äù Jobs said. ‚ÄúThat made me want to be a part of it.‚ÄùLike most kids, he became infused with the passions of the grown-ups around him. ‚ÄúMost of the dads in the neighborhood did really neat stuff, like photovoltaics and batteries and radar,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúI grew up in awe of that stuff and asking people about it.‚Äù The most important of these neighbors, Larry Lange, lived seven doors away. ‚ÄúHe was my model of what an HP engineer was supposed to be: a big ham radio operator, hard-core electronics guy,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúHe would bring me stuff to play with.‚Äù As we walked up to Lange‚Äôs old house, Jobs pointed to the driveway. ‚ÄúHe took a carbon microphone and a battery and a speaker, and he put it on this driveway. He had me talk into the carbon mike and it amplified out of the speaker.‚Äù Jobs had been taught by his father that microphones always required an electronic amplifier. ‚ÄúSo I raced home, and I told my dad that he was wrong.‚Äù‚ÄúNo, it needs an amplifier,‚Äù his father assured him. When Steve protested otherwise, his father said he was crazy. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt work without an amplifier. There‚Äôs some trick.‚Äù‚ÄúI kept saying no to my dad, telling him he had to see it, and finally he actually walked down with me and saw it. And he said, ‚ÄòWell I‚Äôll be a bat out of hell.‚Äô‚Ää‚ÄùJobs recalled the incident vividly because it was his first realization that his father did not know everything. Then a more disconcerting discovery began to dawn on him: He was smarter than his parents. He had always admired his father‚Äôs competence and savvy. ‚ÄúHe was not an educated man, but I had always thought he was pretty damn smart. He didn‚Äôt read much, but he could do a lot. Almost everything mechanical, he could figure it out.‚Äù Yet the carbon microphone incident, Jobs said, began a jarring process of realizing that he was in fact more clever and quick than his parents. ‚ÄúIt was a very big moment that‚Äôs burned into my mind. When I realized that I was smarter than my parents, I felt tremendous shame for having thought that. I will never forget that moment.‚Äù This discovery, he later told friends, along with the fact that he was adopted, made him feel apart‚Äîdetached and separate‚Äîfrom both his family and the world.Another layer of awareness occurred soon after. Not only did he discover that he was brighter than his parents, but he discovered that they knew this. Paul and Clara Jobs were loving parents, and they were willing to adapt their lives to suit a son who was very smart‚Äîand also willful. They would go to great lengths to accommodate him. And soon Steve discovered this fact as well. ‚ÄúBoth my parents got me. They felt a lot of responsibility once they sensed that I was special. They found ways to keep feeding me stuff and putting me in better schools. They were willing to defer to my needs.‚ÄùSo he grew up not only with a sense of having once been abandoned, but also with a sense that he was special. In his own mind, that was more important in the formation of his personality. Even before Jobs started elementary school, his mother had taught him how to read. This, however, led to some problems once he got to school. ‚ÄúI was kind of bored for the first few years, so I occupied myself by getting into trouble.‚Äù It also soon became clear that Jobs, by both nature and nurture, was not disposed to accept authority. ‚ÄúI encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came close to really beating any curiosity out of me.‚ÄùHis school, Monta Loma Elementary, was a series of low-slung 1950s buildings four blocks from his house. He countered his boredom by playing pranks. ‚ÄúI had a good friend named Rick Ferrentino, and we‚Äôd get into all sorts of trouble,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúLike we made little posters announcing ‚ÄòBring Your Pet to School Day.‚Äô It was crazy, with dogs chasing cats all over, and the teachers were beside themselves.‚Äù Another time they convinced some kids to tell them the combination numbers for their bike locks. ‚ÄúThen we went outside and switched all of the locks, and nobody could get their bikes. It took them until late that night to straighten things out.‚Äù When he was in third grade, the pranks became a bit more dangerous. ‚ÄúOne time we set off an explosive under the chair of our teacher, Mrs. Thurman. We gave her a nervous twitch.‚ÄùNot surprisingly, he was sent home two or three times before he finished third grade. By then, however, his father had begun to treat him as special, and in his calm but firm manner he made it clear that he expected the school to do the same. ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs not his fault,‚Äù Paul Jobs told the teachers, his son recalled. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt keep him interested, it‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù His parents never punished him for his transgressions at school. ‚ÄúMy father‚Äôs father was an alcoholic and whipped him with a belt, but I‚Äôm not sure if I ever got spanked.‚Äù Both of his parents, he added, ‚Äúknew the school was at fault for trying to make me memorize stupid stuff rather than stimulating me.‚Äù He was already starting to show the admixture of sensitivity and insensitivity, bristliness and detachment, that would mark him for the rest of his life.When it came time for him to go into fourth grade, the school decided it was best to put Jobs and Ferrentino into separate classes. The teacher for the advanced class was a spunky woman named Imogene Hill, known as ‚ÄúTeddy,‚Äù and she became, Jobs said, ‚Äúone of the saints of my life.‚Äù After watching him for a couple of weeks, she figured that the best way to handle him was to bribe him. ‚ÄúAfter school one day, she gave me this workbook with math problems in it, and she said, ‚ÄòI want you to take it home and do this.‚Äô And I thought, ‚ÄòAre you nuts?‚Äô And then she pulled out one of these giant lollipops that seemed as big as the world. And she said, ‚ÄòWhen you‚Äôre done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give you this and five dollars.‚Äô And I handed it back within two days.‚Äù After a few months, he no longer required the bribes. ‚ÄúI just wanted to learn and to please her.‚ÄùShe reciprocated by getting him a hobby kit for grinding a lens and making a camera. ‚ÄúI learned more from her than any other teacher, and if it hadn‚Äôt been for her I‚Äôm sure I would have gone to jail.‚Äù It reinforced, once again, the idea that he was special. ‚ÄúIn my class, it was just me she cared about. She saw something in me.‚ÄùIt was not merely intelligence that she saw. Years later she liked to show off a picture of that year‚Äôs class on Hawaii Day. Jobs had shown up without the suggested Hawaiian shirt, but in the picture he is front and center wearing one. He had, literally, been able to talk the shirt off another kid‚Äôs back.Near the end of fourth grade, Mrs. Hill had Jobs tested. ‚ÄúI scored at the high school sophomore level,‚Äù he recalled. Now that it was clear, not only to himself and his parents but also to his teachers, that he was intellectually special, the school made the remarkable proposal that he skip two grades and go right into seventh; it would be the easiest way to keep him challenged and stimulated. His parents decided, more sensibly, to have him skip only one grade.The transition was wrenching. He was a socially awkward loner who found himself with kids a year older. Worse yet, the sixth grade was in a different school, Crittenden Middle. It was only eight blocks from Monta Loma Elementary, but in many ways it was a world apart, located in a neighborhood filled with ethnic gangs. ‚ÄúFights were a daily occurrence; as were shakedowns in bathrooms,‚Äù wrote the Silicon Valley journalist Michael S. Malone. ‚ÄúKnives were regularly brought to school as a show of macho.‚Äù Around the time that Jobs arrived, a group of students were jailed for a gang rape, and the bus of a neighboring school was destroyed after its team beat Crittenden‚Äôs in a wrestling match.Jobs was often bullied, and in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum. ‚ÄúI insisted they put me in a different school,‚Äù he recalled. Financially this was a tough demand. His parents were barely making ends meet, but by this point there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. ‚ÄúWhen they resisted, I told them I would just quit going to school if I had to go back to Crittenden. So they researched where the best schools were and scraped together every dime and bought a house for $21,000 in a nicer district.‚ÄùThe move was only three miles to the south, to a former apricot orchard in Los Altos that had been turned into a subdivision of cookie-cutter tract homes. Their house, at 2066 Crist Drive, was one story with three bedrooms and an all-important attached garage with a roll-down door facing the street. There Paul Jobs could tinker with cars and his son with electronics.Its other significant attribute was that it was just over the line inside what was then the Cupertino-Sunnyvale School District, one of the safest and best in the valley. ‚ÄúWhen I moved here, these corners were still orchards,‚Äù Jobs pointed out as we walked in front of his old house. ‚ÄúThe guy who lived right there taught me how to be a good organic gardener and to compost. He grew everything to perfection. I never had better food in my life. That‚Äôs when I began to appreciate organic fruits and vegetables.‚ÄùEven though they were not fervent about their faith, Jobs‚Äôs parents wanted him to have a religious upbringing, so they took him to the Lutheran church most Sundays. That came to an end when he was thirteen. In July 1968 Life magazine published a shocking cover showing a pair of starving children in Biafra. Jobs took it to Sunday school and confronted the church‚Äôs pastor. ‚ÄúIf I raise my finger, will God know which one I‚Äôm going to raise even before I do it?‚ÄùThe pastor answered, ‚ÄúYes, God knows everything.‚ÄùJobs then pulled out the Life cover and asked, ‚ÄúWell, does God know about this and what‚Äôs going to happen to those children?‚Äù‚ÄúSteve, I know you don‚Äôt understand, but yes, God knows about that.‚ÄùJobs announced that he didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with worshipping such a God, and he never went back to church. He did, however, spend years studying and trying to practice the tenets of Zen Buddhism. Reflecting years later on his spiritual feelings, he said that religion was at its best when it emphasized spiritual experiences rather than received dogma. ‚ÄúThe juice goes out of Christianity when it becomes too based on faith rather than on living like Jesus or seeing the world as Jesus saw it,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI think different religions are different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and sometimes I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the great mystery.‚ÄùPaul Jobs was then working at Spectra-Physics, a company in nearby Santa Clara that made lasers for electronics and medical products. As a machinist, he crafted the prototypes of products that the engineers were devising. His son was fascinated by the need for perfection. ‚ÄúLasers require precision alignment,‚Äù Jobs said. ‚ÄúThe really sophisticated ones, for airborne applications or medical, had very precise features. They would tell my dad something like, ‚ÄòThis is what we want, and we want it out of one piece of metal so that the coefficients of expansion are all the same.‚Äô And he had to figure out how to do it.‚Äù Most pieces had to be made from scratch, which meant that Paul had to create custom tools and dies. His son was impressed, but he rarely went to the machine shop. ‚ÄúIt would have been fun if he had gotten to teach me how to use a mill and lathe. But unfortunately I never went, because I was more interested in electronics.‚ÄùOne summer Paul took Steve to Wisconsin to visit the family‚Äôs dairy farm. Rural life did not appeal to Steve, but one image stuck with him. He saw a calf being born, and he was amazed when the tiny animal struggled up within minutes and began to walk. ‚ÄúIt was not something she had learned, but it was instead hardwired into her,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúA human baby couldn‚Äôt do that. I found it remarkable, even though no one else did.‚Äù He put it in hardware-software terms: ‚ÄúIt was as if something in the animal‚Äôs body and in its brain had been engineered to work together instantly rather than being learned.‚ÄùIn ninth grade Jobs went to Homestead High, which had a sprawling campus of two-story cinderblock buildings painted pink that served two thousand students. ‚ÄúIt was designed by a famous prison architect,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúThey wanted to make it indestructible.‚Äù He had developed a love of walking, and he walked the fifteen blocks to school by himself each day.He had few friends his own age, but he got to know some seniors who were immersed in the counterculture of the late 1960s. It was a time when the geek and hippie worlds were beginning to show some overlap. ‚ÄúMy friends were the really smart kids,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was interested in math and science and electronics. They were too, and also into LSD and the whole counterculture trip.‚ÄùHis pranks by then typically involved electronics. At one point he wired his house with speakers. But since speakers can also be used as microphones, he built a control room in his closet, where he could listen in on what was happening in other rooms. One night, when he had his headphones on and was listening in on his parents‚Äô bedroom, his father caught him and angrily demanded that he dismantle the system. He spent many evenings visiting the garage of Larry Lange, the engineer who lived down the street from his old house. Lange eventually gave Jobs the carbon microphone that had fascinated him, and he turned him on to Heathkits, those assemble-it-yourself kits for making ham radios and other electronic gear that were beloved by the soldering set back then. ‚ÄúHeathkits came with all the boards and parts color-coded, but the manual also explained the theory of how it operated,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúIt made you realize you could build and understand anything. Once you built a couple of radios, you‚Äôd see a TV in the catalogue and say, ‚ÄòI can build that as well,‚Äô even if you didn‚Äôt. I was very lucky, because when I was a kid both my dad and the Heathkits made me believe I could build anything.‚ÄùLange also got him into the Hewlett-Packard Explorers Club, a group of fifteen or so students who met in the company cafeteria on Tuesday nights. ‚ÄúThey would get an engineer from one of the labs to come and talk about what he was working on,‚Äù Jobs recalled. ‚ÄúMy dad would drive me there. I was in heaven. HP was a pioneer of light-emitting diodes. So we talked about what to do with them.‚Äù Because his father now worked for a laser company, that topic particularly interested him. One night he cornered one of HP‚Äôs laser engineers after a talk and got a tour of the holography lab. But the most lasting impression came from seeing the small computers the company was developing. ‚ÄúI saw my first desktop computer there. It was called the 9100A, and it was a glorified calculator but also really the first desktop computer. It was huge, maybe forty pounds, but it was a beauty of a thing. I fell in love with it.‚ÄùThe kids in the Explorers Club were encouraged to do projects, and Jobs decided to build a frequency counter, which measures the number of pulses per second in an electronic signal. He needed some parts that HP made, so he picked up the phone and called the CEO. ‚ÄúBack then, people didn‚Äôt have unlisted numbers. So I looked up Bill Hewlett in Palo Alto and called him at home. And he answered and chatted with me for twenty minutes. He got me the parts, but he also got me a job in the plant where they made frequency counters.‚Äù Jobs worked there the summer after his freshman year at Homestead High. ‚ÄúMy dad would drive me in the morning and pick me up in the evening.‚ÄùHis work mainly consisted of ‚Äújust putting nuts and bolts on things‚Äù on an assembly line. There was some resentment among his fellow line workers toward the pushy kid who had talked his way in by calling the CEO. ‚ÄúI remember telling one of the supervisors, ‚ÄòI love this stuff, I love this stuff,‚Äô and then I asked him what he liked to do best. And he said, ‚ÄòTo fuck, to fuck.‚Äô‚Ää‚Äù Jobs had an easier time ingratiating himself with the engineers who worked one floor above. ‚ÄúThey served doughnuts and coffee every morning at ten. So I‚Äôd go upstairs and hang out with them.‚ÄùJobs liked to work. He also had a newspaper route‚Äîhis father would drive him when it was raining‚Äîand during his sophomore year spent weekends and the summer as a stock clerk at a cavernous electronics store, Haltek. It was to electronics what his father‚Äôs junkyards were to auto parts: a scavenger‚Äôs paradise sprawling over an entire city block with new, used, salvaged, and surplus components crammed onto warrens of shelves, dumped unsorted into bins, and piled in an outdoor yard. ‚ÄúOut in the back, near the bay, they had a fenced-in area with things like Polaris submarine interiors that had been ripped and sold for salvage,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúAll the controls and buttons were right there. The colors were military greens and grays, but they had these switches and bulb covers of amber and red. There were these big old lever switches that, when you flipped them, it was awesome, like you were blowing up Chicago.‚ÄùAt the wooden counters up front, laden with thick catalogues in tattered binders, people would haggle for switches, resistors, capacitors, and sometimes the latest memory chips. His father used to do that for auto parts, and he succeeded because he knew the value of each better than the clerks. Jobs followed suit. He developed a knowledge of electronic parts that was honed by his love of negotiating and turning a profit. He would go to electronic flea markets, such as the San Jose swap meet, haggle for a used circuit board that contained some valuable chips or components, and then sell those to his manager at Haltek.Jobs was able to get his first car, with his father‚Äôs help, when he was fifteen. It was a two-tone Nash Metropolitan that his father had fitted out with an MG engine. Jobs didn‚Äôt really like it, but he did not want to tell his father that, or miss out on the chance to have his own car. ‚ÄúIn retrospect, a Nash Metropolitan might seem like the most wickedly cool car,‚Äù he later said. ‚ÄúBut at the time it was the most uncool car in the world. Still, it was a car, so that was great.‚Äù Within a year he had saved up enough from his various jobs that he could trade up to a red Fiat 850 coupe with an Abarth engine. ‚ÄúMy dad helped me buy and inspect it. The satisfaction of getting paid and saving up for something, that was very exciting.‚ÄùThat same summer, between his sophomore and junior years at Homestead, Jobs began smoking marijuana. ‚ÄúI got stoned for the first time that summer. I was fifteen, and then began using pot regularly.‚Äù At one point his father found some dope in his son‚Äôs Fiat. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù he asked. Jobs coolly replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs marijuana.‚Äù It was one of the few times in his life that he faced his father‚Äôs anger. ‚ÄúThat was the only real fight I ever got in with my dad,‚Äù he said. But his father again bent to his will. ‚ÄúHe wanted me to promise that I‚Äôd never use pot again, but I wouldn‚Äôt promise.‚Äù In fact by his senior year he was also dabbling in LSD and hash as well as exploring the mind-bending effects of sleep deprivation. ‚ÄúI was starting to get stoned a bit more. We would also drop acid occasionally, usually in fields or in cars.‚ÄùHe also flowered intellectually during his last two years in high school and found himself at the intersection, as he had begun to see it, of those who were geekily immersed in electronics and those who were into literature and creative endeavors. ‚ÄúI started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology‚ÄîShakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear.‚Äù His other favorites included Moby-Dick and the poems of Dylan Thomas. I asked him why he related to King Lear and Captain Ahab, two of the most willful and driven characters in literature, but he didn‚Äôt respond to the connection I was making, so I let it drop. ‚ÄúWhen I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite.‚ÄùOne course that Jobs took would become part of Silicon Valley lore: the electronics class taught by John McCollum, a former Navy pilot who had a showman‚Äôs flair for exciting his students with such tricks as firing up a Tesla coil. His little stockroom, to which he would lend the key to pet students, was crammed with transistors and other components he had scored.McCollum‚Äôs classroom was in a shed-like building on the edge of the campus, next to the parking lot. ‚ÄúThis is where it was,‚Äù Jobs recalled as he peered in the window, ‚Äúand here, next door, is where the auto shop class used to be.‚Äù The juxtaposition highlighted the shift from the interests of his father‚Äôs generation. ‚ÄúMr. McCollum felt that electronics class was the new auto shop.‚ÄùMcCollum believed in military discipline and respect for authority. Jobs didn‚Äôt. His aversion to authority was something he no longer tried to hide, and he affected an attitude that combined wiry and weird intensity with aloof rebelliousness. McCollum later said, ‚ÄúHe was usually off in a corner doing something on his own and really didn‚Äôt want to have much of anything to do with either me or the rest of the class.‚Äù He never trusted Jobs with a key to the stockroom. One day Jobs needed a part that was not available, so he made a collect call to the manufacturer, Burroughs in Detroit, and said he was designing a new product and wanted to test out the part. It arrived by air freight a few days later. When McCollum asked how he had gotten it, Jobs described‚Äîwith defiant pride‚Äîthe collect call and the tale he had told. ‚ÄúI was furious,‚Äù McCollum said. ‚ÄúThat was not the way I wanted my students to behave.‚Äù Jobs‚Äôs response was, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the money for the phone call. They‚Äôve got plenty of money.‚ÄùJobs took McCollum‚Äôs class for only one year, rather than the three that it was offered. For one of his projects, he made a device with a photocell that would switch on a circuit when exposed to light, something any high school science student could have done. He was far more interested in playing with lasers, something he learned from his father. With a few friends, he created light shows for parties by bouncing lasers off mirrors that were attached to the speakers of his stereo system.

TRANSCRIPT
You know Steve Jobs was one of those romantic innovators who comes up with great ideas, has real passion, real vision and that prickly personality, that very pushy reality distorting personality that can get something done. However, in writing about Steve Jobs I realized something interesting. It wasn‚Äôt just his one vision. It was his ability to create a team around him, his ability to work in partnership with Steve Wozniak. You go down the list with dozens of people all the way to Tim Cook. And not only to work in partnership but to create a collaborative team around him of great designers like Jony Ive and software people like Phil Schiller and Johnny Rubinstein. And I once asked Steve Jobs, you know, what product are you the proudest of. And I thought he might say the iPod or the iPhone or the iPad, whatever, the Mac. And he said, you know, making a product is hard but making a team that can continually make products is even harder. The product I‚Äôm most proud of is Apple and the team I built at Apple. And that‚Äôs when I moved to this new book, The Innovators, because I wanted to say it‚Äôs not just about the visionary, it‚Äôs about the visionary being able to execute on the vision by finding the right people to be collaborative and creative with. So with Steve Jobs even though we think of him as being a tough boss or we think of him as having sort of a prickly personality, there were people who were so loyal to Steve they would walk through walls for him. He developed around him the tightest, most loyal, most integrated team in Silicon Valley.
You know, Steve Jobs was very intuitive in the way he made decisions. He wasn‚Äôt somebody who deeply reflected or spent a whole lot of time hashing it through. But he would work with everybody from the hardware designers like Jony Ive to the software people and just sort of say no, that doesn‚Äôt feel right. Sometimes he used a little bit stronger language than that. Or it‚Äôs genius, it‚Äôs perfect, it‚Äôs awesome, it‚Äôs incredible. But, you know, don‚Äôt try this at home. People come up to me sometimes and say I‚Äôm like Steve Jobs - when somebody does something that stinks I tell them it stinks. Yeah and have you invented the iPod? Have you invented an iPhone? No, Steve Jobs didn‚Äôt just have a tough personality. He also had a charismatic visionary personality and he brought people in.
And he really could inspire people because even though sometimes he couldn‚Äôt articulate exactly what he wanted he could sure point the way to getting it there. He also believed in physical space as necessary for collaboration. We think maybe we can collaborate in the digital age by doing it virtually from afar but when he built the Pixar building and when he designed what will be the new headquarters for Apple it was all about making sure people had serendipitous encounters. That they came through the atrium. That they walked through the perimeter where the light was in the new Apple headquarters. Where they would just bump into people and say what are you working on. And then naturally collaborate. But he felt that, you know, just by walking through Jony Ives design studio and touching a few things and talking to people he could collaborate by being in a physical space better than he could do it by Skype or email or, you know, Google hangouts. So Steve‚Äôs team building skills really sort of came from the force of his personality and being with him.

Making the iBio for Apple‚Äôs Genius

After Steve Jobs anointed Walter Isaacson as his authorized biographer in 2009, he took Mr. Isaacson to see the Mountain View, Calif., house in which he had lived as a boy. He pointed out its ‚Äúclean design‚Äù and ‚Äúawesome little features.‚Äù He praised the developer, Joseph Eichler, who built more than 11,000 homes in California subdivisions, for making an affordable product on a mass-market scale. And he showed Mr. Isaacson the stockade fence built 50 years earlier by his father, Paul Jobs.‚ÄúHe loved doing things right,‚Äù Mr. Jobs said. ‚ÄúHe even cared about the look of the parts you couldn‚Äôt see.‚ÄùMr. Jobs, the brilliant and protean creator whose inventions so utterly transformed the allure of technology, turned those childhood lessons into an all-purpose theory of intelligent design. He gave Mr. Isaacson a chance to play by the same rules. His story calls for a book that is clear, elegant and concise enough to qualify as an iBio. Mr. Isaacson‚Äôs ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù does its solid best to hit that target.

As a biographer of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, Mr. Isaacson knows how to explicate and celebrate genius: revered, long-dead genius. But he wrote ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù as its subject was mortally ill, and that is a more painful and delicate challenge. (He had access to members of the Jobs family at a difficult time.) Mr. Jobs promised not to look over Mr. Isaacson‚Äôs shoulder, and not to meddle with anything but the book‚Äôs cover. (Boy, does it look great.) And he expressed approval that the book would not be entirely flattering. But his legacy was at stake. And there were awkward questions to be asked. At the end of the volume, Mr. Jobs answers the question ‚ÄúWhat drove me?‚Äù by discussing himself in the past tense.

Mr. Isaacson treats ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù as the biography of record, which means that it is a strange book to read so soon after its subject‚Äôs death. Some of it is an essential Silicon Valley chronicle, compiling stories well known to tech aficionados but interesting to a broad audience. Some of it is already quaint. Mr. Jobs‚Äôs first job was at Atari, and it involved the game Pong. (‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre under 30, ask your parents,‚Äù Mr. Isaacson writes.) Some, like an account of the release of the iPad 2, is so recent that it is hard to appreciate yet, even if Mr. Isaacson says the device comes to life ‚Äúlike the face of a tickled baby.‚Äù¬† Continue reading the main story

And some is definitely intended for future generations. ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Mr. Isaacson writes, ‚Äúits success came not just from the beauty of the hardware but from the applications, known as apps, that allowed you to indulge in all sorts of delightful activities.‚Äù One that he mentions, which will be as quaint as Pong some day, features the use of a slingshot to launch angry birds to destroy pigs and their fortresses.

So ‚ÄúSteve Jobs,‚Äù an account of its subject‚Äôs 56 years (he died on Oct. 5), must reach across time in more ways than one. And it does, in a well-ordered, if not streamlined, fashion. It begins with a portrait of the young Mr. Jobs, rebellious toward the parents who raised him and scornful of the ones who gave him up for adoption. (‚ÄúThey were my sperm and egg bank,‚Äù he says.)Although Mr. Isaacson is not analytical about his subject‚Äôs volatile personality (the word ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù figures in the book frequently), he raises the question of whether feelings of abandonment in childhood made him fanatically controlling and manipulative as an adult. Fortunately, that glib question stays unanswered.Mr. Jobs, who founded Apple with Stephen Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976, began his career as a seemingly contradictory blend of hippie truth seeker and tech-savvy hothead.

‚ÄúHis Zen awareness was not accompanied by an excess of calm, peace of mind or interpersonal mellowness,‚Äù Mr. Isaacson says. ‚ÄúHe could stun an unsuspecting victim with an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed,‚Äù he also writes. But Mr. Jobs valued simplicity, utility and beauty in ways that would shape his creative imagination. And the book maintains that those goals would not have been achievable in the great parade of Apple creations without that mean streak.Mr. Isaacson takes his readers back to the time when laptops, desktops and windows were metaphors, not everyday realities. His book ticks off how each of the Apple innovations that we now take for granted first occurred to Mr. Jobs or his creative team. ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù means to be the authoritative book about those achievements, and it also follows Mr. Jobs into the wilderness (and to NeXT and Pixar) after his first stint at Apple, which ended in 1985.With an avid interest in corporate intrigue, it skewers Mr. Jobs‚Äôs rivals, like John Sculley, who was recruited in 1983 to be Apple‚Äôs chief executive and fell for Mr. Jobs‚Äôs deceptive show of friendship. ‚ÄúThey professed their fondness so effusively and often that they sounded like high school sweethearts at a Hallmark card display,‚Äù Mr. Isaacson writes.

Of course the book also tracks Mr. Jobs‚Äôs long and combative rivalry with Bill Gates. The section devoted to Mr. Jobs‚Äôs illness, which suggests that his cancer might have been more treatable had he not resisted early surgery, describes the relative tenderness of their last meeting.

‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù greatly admires its subject. But its most adulatory passages are not about people. Offering a combination of tech criticism and promotional hype, Mr. Isaacson describes the arrival of each new product right down to Mr. Jobs‚Äôs theatrical introductions and the advertising campaigns. But if the individual bits of hoopla seem excessive, their cumulative effect is staggering. Here is an encyclopedic survey of all that Mr. Jobs accomplished, replete with the passion and excitement that it deserves.Mr. Jobs‚Äôs virtual reinvention of the music business with iTunes and the iPod, for instance, is made to seem all the more miraculous (‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a turn-key solution,‚Äù the music executive Jimmy Iovine said.) Mr. Isaacson‚Äôs long view basically puts Mr. Jobs up there with Franklin and Einstein, even if a tiny MP3 player is not quite the theory of relativity. The book emphasizes how deceptively effortless Mr. Jobs‚Äôs ideas now seem because of their extreme intuitiveness and foresight. When Mr. Jobs, who personally persuaded musician after musician to accept the iTunes model, approached Wynton Marsalis, Mr. Marsalis was rightly more impressed with Mr. Jobs than with the device he was being shown.

Mr. Jobs‚Äôs love of music plays a big role in ‚ÄúSteve Jobs,‚Äù like his extreme obsession with Bob Dylan. (Like Mr. Dylan, he had a romance with Joan Baez. Her version of Mr. Dylan‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove Is Just a Four-Letter Word‚Äù was on Mr. Jobs‚Äôs own iPod.) So does his extraordinary way of perceiving ordinary things, like well-made knives and kitchen appliances. That he admired the Cuisinart food processor he saw at Macy‚Äôs may sound trivial, but his subsequent idea that a molded plastic covering might work well on a computer does not. Years from now, the research trip to a jelly bean factory to study potential colors for the iMac case will not seem as silly as it might now.Skeptic after skeptic made the mistake of underrating Steve Jobs, and Mr. Isaacson records the howlers who misjudged an unrivaled career. ‚ÄúSorry Steve, Here‚Äôs Why Apple Stores Won‚Äôt Work,‚Äù Business Week wrote in a 2001 headline. ‚ÄúThe iPod will likely become a niche product,‚Äù a Harvard Business School professor said. ‚ÄúHigh tech could not be designed and sold as a consumer product,‚Äù Mr. Sculley said in 1987.Mr. Jobs got the last laugh every time. ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù makes it all the sadder that his last laugh is over.

STEVE JOBS


By Walter Isaacson

 Illustrated. 630 pages. Simon & Schuster. $35.


 Correction: October 26, 2011  
The Books of The Times review on Saturday, about ‚ÄúSteve Jobs,‚Äù by Walter Isaacson, described Angry Birds, a popular iPhone game, incorrectly. Slingshots are used to launch birds to destroy pigs and their fortresses, not to shoot down the birds.

Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography book of Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and TIME who has written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.[1][2]
Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîin addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîIsaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life.[3] Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published.[4]
The book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.[5]
A film adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, with Michael Fassbender starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.

Appearance[edit]




The book's cover photograph is similar to one taken previously by Norman Seeff and featured on Rolling Stone.[6]


Front cover[edit]
The front cover uses a photographic portrait of Steve Jobs commissioned by Fortune magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.
When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4√ó5 camera before saying, "wow, you're shooting film."[7]

If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.
‚Äî‚ÄâAlbert Watson[7]

Jobs gave Watson an hour‚Äîlonger than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.[7]
The title font is Helvetica.[8]
Back cover[edit]
The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by TIME magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.[9]

We did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses‚Äîhe lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder‚Äîand I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here‚Äîthis was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.
‚Äî‚ÄâNorman Seeff[9]





The placeholder cover used for the book uses the working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs.


Title[edit]
The book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant."[10]
The title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.[11]
Chapters[edit]
Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.

Film adaptation[edit]
Main article: Steve Jobs (film)
Steve Jobs is a drama film based on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).
Other media[edit]
Extracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.[12]
To memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.[13] The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.[14]
Bloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.
Fortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the "friend-enemy" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.[15]

Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie. He didn't much like to shower or wear shoes. He believed his diet kept him from getting stinky, not true apparently. In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange.

Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie. He didn't much like to shower or wear shoes. He believed his diet kept him from getting stinky, not true apparently. In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange. This makes me wonder if these strange eating habits brought on his cancer. Who can say?Steve Jobs was an asshat.He was an ass to everyone, even Steve Wozniak, who by everyone's standards is one of the nicest guys there is. Wozniak was Job's only friend at times, and looked up to him always, but Jobs screwed him over time and again. Jobs didn't even claim his first born daughter (until much later) as his own even though there was no doubt she belonged to him. He also was a very emotional man, lots of crying and snot when he wanted something. Impossible to please, even down to the color of things. I seriously don't know how anything got finished, I really don't.Steve Jobs was a super genius.Despite of (or because of) all this he created the most amazing things. Because he demanded the impossible, he would get it. I love my Ipod and my Ipad. I'm very attached, I don't want to live without them. I use the Ipod for my audiobook and podcast addiction. I'm even learning how to draw caricatures on the Ipad.....so frik'n cool. Thank you Steve for being a damn dirty hippie, asshat super genius. Your creations have enhanced, and changed our lives.Review also appears on Shelfinflicted....Go and visit!

There are three things necessary for a great biography:1. A compelling subject2. An engaging narrative3. AccuracyWalter Isaacson's Steve Jobs has all three.Steve Jobs was a fascinating person whose powerful personality and extraordinary life make for a very compelling read. He revolutionized many different technological and entertainment industries by successfully blending technology and the liberal arts, giving consumers products they didn't even know they wanted. He was able to defy reality by simply refusing to accept it (a phenomenon referred to as his "reality distortion field"), enabling him to do the impossible. On a personal level, Jobs was a very sensitive and emotional man, yet he was unable to empathize with the feelings of others, which, along with his "reality distortion field," led to him act in unsavory ways towards people in both his personal and professional life. After reading this book it was easy to understand why Jobs is such a polarizing figure. But whether you love or hate him, it's impossible to deny that he had a major impact on the world, or that he was an interesting person.Isaacson's narrative style is engaging. Rather than listing a bunch of facts and quotes, which would make for a very dull read, he uses them to construct a story about Jobs' life. The book is also structured in a logical fashion. Although largely chronological, the chapters do center around certain themes. Isaacson also avoids getting bogged down by technological details, which can be a temptation in a book that features a computer company. Even when the technological aspects of a product are necessary to illustrate a point, they are explained simply so that even a reader who is not tech savvy can understand.In terms of accuracy, I can only judge based on what I know from other sources as well as my impression after reading the biography. I do not have the resources or connections to go through every assertion made and verify them. I can, however, assess whether or not Isaacson appeared to be presenting an overly positive or negative picture. I believe that Isaacson presents a realistic picture of Jobs that includes both the positive and negative sides to his personality. Jobs comes across as a real person with a lot of flaws and perhaps a mental illness, but who has also accomplished some amazing things. I did not get the feeling that Isaacson was trying to whitewash or defame him. This is not to say that Isaacson is unbiased, but I have yet to find a biographer who isn't. A biographer must be passionate about his or her subject in order to devote the time needed to write a thorough biography, and with passion comes bias, whether positive or negative. Isaacson was positively biased towards Jobs, however, this did not prevent him from exposing the darker side of Jobs' personality. He also contradicts Jobs' own statements with both facts and other people's accounts. I appreciated that he included both sides of a story. However, he does tend to justify Jobs' obnoxious behavior and negative personality traits by reminding the reader that these behaviors and traits also led him to do great things, and achieve the impossible. It often seems as though Isaacson is implying that the ends justify the means, although the reader is able to form his or her own opinion. If you can ignore Isaacson's apologetic tone, which is present throughout, the biography does present a balanced picture of Jobs.Overall, I really enjoyed this biography. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Steve Jobs, Apple, or is interested in particularly influential people. Although Pixar plays a much smaller role, there are also some interesting stories about how Pixar came to be what it is today. I would not recommend this biography to Apple haters or Steve Jobs haters due to Isaacson's apologetic presentation of Jobs' negative traits, nor would I recommend it to fans who would rather remember an idealized version of Jobs. Also, I'd caution readers to remember that this is a biography about Steve Jobs, not about the history of Apple. While Apple is featured in this biography quite a bit since it was a huge part of Jobs' life, more so than his other companies or even his family, there are pieces of Apple's story that are missing or glossed over, presumably because in the grand scheme of Jobs' life, they were not that important. If you are looking for a complete profile of Apple, this is not it, although it will give you some interesting insights into the company, and provide a detailed, though incomplete, history.Disclaimer: I think it's important to note my personal history with Apple. I have been drinking the Apple koolaid for about twenty years, which is most of my life. In high school, I used to get into debates with people over whether Macs or PCs were better, often being the only Mac defender in a group arguing for PCs. Like any Apple fanatic, I've regarded Steve Jobs with a sort of reverence usually reserved for rock stars and actors. I was, therefore, deeply interested in reading about his life. Take what you will from my review given my feelings towards Apple, and the man who made the company what it is today.

Update This is a very interesting view of Steve Jobs by the mother of his daughter, Lisa (although he denied he was her father, despite paternity tests) and his childhood sweetheart. She doesn't think the film goes far enough in depicting his character truthfully. I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true. Apple's lawyers would sue her out of all existence if there was even a word that they could latch onto. But still
Update This is a very interesting view of Steve Jobs by the mother of his daughter, Lisa (although he denied he was her father, despite paternity tests) and his childhood sweetheart. She doesn't think the film goes far enough in depicting his character truthfully. I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true. Apple's lawyers would sue her out of all existence if there was even a word that they could latch onto. But still, her feelings and opinions are her own.____________This is a fantastically well-written and exhaustive biography of a brilliant, if flawed, man, with no holds barred. Jobs great achievement was to marry an uncompromisingly zen creativity to electronically-advanced products when all around built boxes. The art of form following function taken to its extreme, where even the innards are as beautiful as the case, has an authenticity that appeals to all (even those who won't pay for an Apple product).They say that when you are dying you regret not what you did but what you didn't do. Jobs scarcely regretted a thing, his ego was so vast he could hardly contemplate that he might actually have been wrong and since a young age, he only ever did what he wanted and could not be swayed or persuaded by anyone else to even do something as small as hold his acerbic tongue. I was once an electronics designer. I made quite a lot of money and essentially retired at 25. Sir Alan Sugar, the originator of The Apprentice and a friend and business acquaintance asked me to come to work for him as his personal assistant. I didn't, I decided to sail around the world instead. More fool me. The book made me wish, and not for the first time and not because I am now quite poor (all booksellers are, except the Amazon crew) that I hadn't left electronics, because my head is again full of ideas and that is where they will have to stay. So I have regrets even now.I took the road less travelled and it turned out to end up in a tropical mangrove swamp where I sit, pleasantly bogged down. Jobs took the highway, the one with a good surface and plenty of signs. He overtook everyone and reached his destination of unqualified success, excellence, money and credibility in a very short time, and the world would be a lot poorer without him. RIP Steve. You were a true artist and visionary.I haven't got a Mac myself. Because, as the advert said, I'm just not cool enough....Edit May 2014. I went to dinner on a 93' yacht with a chef, hostess and a couple of crew and the captain gave me an iPad for a present. He said it was only a first gen. one and I was too cool not to have a Mac :-) This is true ;-). I did't see the captain for about three or four months. We were in the same marina bar. He asked me how I liked the ipad and I said great and went to get it out of my bag. It was gone. Someone had stolen it from my bag within the last ten minutes (I'd only been there that long). But who... in a crowd how can you tell? I have a really cheap under $100 Chinese tablet now. It does everything that the ipad did but it isn't thin and cool. But then neither am I.Finished March 1, 2012

When I was at the halfway point I became struck by what a jerk SJ was. Yes, he was brilliant and all that. But he seemed to view other humans as nothing more than ants in his ant farm, sub-biologicals that he could squish whenever he felt like it. And did.Some might say that his gifts to tech development, or the fact that he changed and invented whole industries, would compensate. Maybe the two things went together, cruelty and brilliance.

When I was at the halfway point I became struck by what a jerk SJ was. Yes, he was brilliant and all that. But he seemed to view other humans as nothing more than ants in his ant farm, sub-biologicals that he could squish whenever he felt like it. And did.Some might say that his gifts to tech development, or the fact that he changed and invented whole industries, would compensate. Maybe the two things went together, cruelty and brilliance. But the lesson to be drawn here, future CEOs, isn't that his cruelty fed his brilliance. He was brilliant, and he was cruel, and they weren't linked. He was aware of the pain he was causing other people, yet like so many other overbearing, thoughtless and petulant overlords, Jobs was thin-skinned. Also, I don't believe that his often-cited sense of abandonment, from having been put up for adoption, justifies his behavior.He was, as the author put it, "bratty." Jobs would fiddle with design changes to the point of driving his team mad. A thousand different variations of white weren't satisfactory. He wanted a new color to be invented, regardless of the damage done to the rollout of the new object. As I said, I'm only halfway through the book. Hopefully there'll be some positive info about SJ that will balance out some of the negativity I've spelled out. I'll finish this review when I finish the book.Nov. 8, 2011: I finished the book. Here are the rest of my thoughts.Isaacson makes an interesting point when he says Jobs was a genius. He means genius not in terms of a high IQ, but in terms of an ability to see things in surges of intuition, inspiration, and creativity. (BTW here's an interesting rundown of the smartest people on the planet: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-sm...) Because of his genius, I agree that Jobs deserves to be included in the company of Edison, Franklin, et al. Steve Jobs pushed everybody until they wanted to kill him, but the pushing yielded amazing, brilliant new products. His unique brainpower allowed him to see how things might align, merge, and serve each other, and how utility might be blended with art. That vision led to creations of whole industries. His obsession with perfection and control led him to flirt with emulating the Big Brother that Apple was created to bring down. One of the fascinating threads of this book was the debate between proponents of closed and open systems. Was it better to manufacture a pristine, inflexible system or the messier free thinking open system? And what were the implications of that belief on Jobs' view of his customers and his worldview?Yet he defined petulance. His food had to be just so. He would send back a glass of orange juice three times until finally satisfied it was fresh. He was vindictive, cruel and even Machiavellian. He wasn't much of a family man, and he ignored his kids to a painful extent. Isaacson mused that Jobs' meanness wasn't a critical part of his success. He was totally aware of its effect on others, yet he indulged.In spite of my aversion to the man, I actually felt empowered as I came to the end of the book. Steve Jobs had lived by certain precepts, which in the current economy we could all benefit from:---Know your value ---Have a skill you can sell. Be really, really good at something.---Things can turn around if you persevere, but don't be afraid to walk away.Unbending to the end, even the prospect of death didn't soften him up much, but he brought me up short on the last page of the book, because I am obsessed with the same question:"I like to think that something survives after you die. It's strange to think that you accumulate all this experience, and maybe a little wisdom, and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, and that maybe your consciousness endures." I closed the book with a bit more compassion for this difficult man and went outside to pick cilantro for that night's dinner. Since we'd just had a serious storm, I declined to rinse it. I simply cleaned it, thinking, ‚ÄúOrganic and pristine from the garden. Steve would‚Äôve approved.‚Äù

Never expected to find this much enjoyment reading a biography. Isaacson has truly done a wonderful job with this book. For those who are too busy to read the entire book, please try to grab a quick read of the last two chapters of the book at a book store or airport or someplace - These chapters are a concise summary of the entire book as well as the thesis Isaacson builds up to throughout the book. Besides, it will probably make you buy and read the whole thing anyway.To call this man a "Great Marketer" is probably a great disservice to him and Steve would probably have had a fit about that. I used to think of him as an epitome of modern marketing as well, but he would probably classify marketing as 'evil' in his radar. He hated the idea of any company focusing on marketing and emphatically states that is the whole problem with most companies today. This is probably a difficult idea to get to grips with, but is essential too.I hope every Management Guru and CEO is studying this book and drawing the right lessons. We could truly be in a better world if they do. Just to clarify, I am not a fanboy of all apple products though I am sure the Mac is the best tech device till date but I do I fall on the android side of the fence. But, Jobs' philosophy on running companies and driving innovation is the best in the modern age and should be copied shamelessly, if not their product features (I am looking at you Samsung).

I'd really like to know more about his family dynamic. What was his parents' parenting style? The book says NOTHING about the adopted sister he grew up with. Anyone who has grown up with siblings can attest to the influence of siblings on their personality. To me the lack of insight into his teen and pre-teen life leaves a glaring hole in understanding the man.My opinion of Steve Jobs: The ends don't justify the means. I don't care how creative or driven you are; you're not allowed to be an asshole to your fellow human beings.

Executive summary of Isaacson's "Steve Jobs":- Remove everything that is unnecessary.- Be ruthless about building an A team.- Make stuff you believe in.- Collaborate often through vigorous discussion.- Push yourself and others to do the impossible now.- Make great experiences by simplifying.- Own your work and protect it.- Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.But these are not spoilers.

Executive summary of Isaacson's "Steve Jobs":- Remove everything that is unnecessary.- Be ruthless about building an A team.- Make stuff you believe in.- Collaborate often through vigorous discussion.- Push yourself and others to do the impossible now.- Make great experiences by simplifying.- Own your work and protect it.- Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.But these are not spoilers. The drama of this biography is in the decisions Jobs' made, the way he followed through on these ideals. Read the book. In the same way that you understand a proverb much more after you've had a life a experience that demonstrates it, these will mean much, much more when you see them in the context of Steve Jobs' life.Plus, you'll also discover Jobs' equally as compelling character traits: from his idealism to his irascibility.

This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful.

This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful. He believed that computers were "at the intersection of technology and liberal arts" - a phrase he used a lot - because he realized computers weren't just for geeks. They are for everyone, and needed to be able to be used by everyone.Steve put design at the top of product pyramid at Apple - above engineering. This means they spent a lot of time trying to fit the hardware into the beautifully designed cases the designers came up with, and the designers and engineers had to work together closely. This can backfire (eg Antennagate), but largely it worked really well. It produced amazing computers that were visually distinct from everything else in the market, and that "just work". If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it.Apple's design philosophy is to "make it simple. Really simple". You still see this today - go to Apple.com - you will see ONE product. Now try Amazon. According to the book, Jobs learned this from Markkula, who taught him that "A great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it makes". Steve's ethos was basically that if you are going to do something, do it right. The book is full of examples of Steve doing this. When the iMac first came out it looked like no other computer. It was interesting to hear how difficult it was for the engineers to accommodate a handle on the computer - but it ended up being a defining feature of the computer. I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores.Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like "jerk" to describe him. It sounds like Steve could definitely be a jerk to work for. His management style was to push people as hard as he could, and to let people know when they didn't perform. When pushed like that, a person can have one of two reactions: they either resent it, and end up quitting or getting fired (B-players) - or they accept the challenge to do better, and come back the next week with something even better. Win-win for Steve - he filters out the b-players and gets his a-players to produce the best work they can. But, as was pointed out in the book, if Steve was nothing but a jerk, he wouldn't have built a company full of loyal employees - Apple has one of the lowest turnover rates in the valley. Jobs only hired people who "had a passion for the product". I also liked how he motivated by looking at the bigger picture; such as the story of how he convinced his engineer that saving 10 seconds off the boot time was worth it because across 5 million users that would save 100 lifetimes per year.The book was full of references to Steve's dynamic personality; his "reality distortion field" is a great descriptor. Steve believed he could do anything - and he was so persuasive that he could convince those around him that they could whatever it was too. I think this is one of the most defining qualities of an entrepreneur - believing something can be done against all odds. Not being afraid to tear down walls or think outside the box. I loved the description of Steve that "whatever he was touting was the best thing he ever produced." You see him do this in his keynote speeches too. He is always using words like "best", "amazing", etc to describe whatever he's launching. A big theme that the author made was that especially early on, Steve viewed Apple as "counter-culture" rebels. They were hippies who thought they could change the world. And they did - but not only that - I think they embedded their can-do attitude deep in Silicon Valley, which is probably highly correlated with why it is the center of the technology revolution today. This quote is classic:
"The people who invited the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently. The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence."
One of Steve's great abilities was to focus. When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential. 
"What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they‚Äôre dragging you down. They‚Äôre turning you into Microsoft. They‚Äôre causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great."
Steve's belief that computers need to be beautiful and easy to use basically prevented him from ever licensing his software, as then he wouldn't be able to control the user experience. Microsoft didn't have that problem, and that's why Windows dominated. I think it's also the reason that Windows is in trouble today. They have spent a decade making their code work across hundreds of different hardware configurations. Their code is now full of backwards compatibility support that just makes it messy, and bloated. Worse, their focus is on maintaining all that instead of innovating and improving it. The platform vs integrated approach is being tested again with the iphone vs android. It will be interesting to see if history replays itself, or if Apple's lead and ability to make a superior product because of their full stack control will prevail.In the end, this was the best quote of the book:
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it.Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography.

I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it.Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography. Isaacson declined several times, thinking that it was too soon to write one and that it would be better to wait a few decades. It wasn't until 2009 when Jobs' wife bluntly told him that Jobs was seriously ill from cancer and that there was little time to lose. Isaacson said he hadn't known Jobs was sick; she said few people knew and that Jobs had been trying to keep it a secret.Isaacson finally agreed to write the biography, and Jobs agreed that he wouldn't have any control over the book, which was rare, considering how controlling and demanding he had been over all the various projects at Apple.I had been reluctant to read this book for several reasons. First, because Jobs was a known jackass and I wasn't that interested in reading the various examples of his jackassery. Second, I am not a techie, and while I like and use Apple products every day, I was hesitant to spend my precious reading time on a tech book. Thirdly, this bio is more than 600 pages long! That seemed excessive.A solution was found in an audiobook (read by Dylan Baker), and I am glad I gave it a chance. I was won over early on in the book, when Isaacson included a quote from Jobs in the introduction:"'I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,' he said. 'Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.' It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century."Now THAT is a theme I can get behind. I love the idea of combining artistry and technology, and it's true that Jobs and Apple excelled at creating innovative and beautiful products. Despite my hesitation, I ended up enjoying the stories of how Jobs got his start in computers, and how he met and started collaborating with Steve Wozniak, and the evolution of products at Apple over the decades. Growing up in the 80s, I frequently used those early Apple computers. My friends and I played games on them, and I wrote my school reports on them. Apple computers were just so cool. I liked learning the details of how Jobs helped design the products, including his emphasis that even the parts that are not seen should be beautiful and well-built. He had learned this at a young age from his father, who was a mechanic and a craftsman, and he taught Steve to make sure that the back of something was crafted just as well as the front, even if no one saw it. Jobs took the spirit of artistry very seriously, and always insisted that the designers at Apple were making art with their products. He even had his design team sign the inside of the computer frames, just as a painter would, even though no one but them knew it was there.Another part of the book that I found interesting was Jobs' history with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with whom he had a fiercely competitive but (mostly) respectful relationship. The two men had very different ideas about system design, and computer techies will probably enjoy the debate of open vs. closed systems. A lot has been written about what a jerk Jobs could be, including telling people to their face that they sucked, that their designs sucked, and that they should be fired for their suckitude. It is also true that he was a dirty hippie, and in the early days of Apple, colleagues had to beg him to take a shower. (Jobs thought that because he was a vegetarian, he didn't need to bathe.) At certain points, I was infuriated with Jobs, both over his treatment of others and later, over his refusal to deal with his cancer diagnosis. When he first learned he was ill, he defied his doctor's advice and delayed having surgery to remove the tumors, giving them months to spread. While impossible to prove, it is likely he could have greatly extended his life had he not been so stubborn in avoiding modern medicine.In the end, I admit I was fascinated by Steve Jobs. He had a remarkable life and career, and while it is a cliche, his products helped change the world. I would highly recommend this biography.Update April 2016Last night I watched the "Steve Jobs" movie that is based on this book (starring Michael Fassbender), and I have to give a shout-out to screenwriter Aaron Sorkin for creating such a compelling film out of this sprawling biography. I was happy I had read this book before watching the movie, because I understood more of the context of the arguments between Woz and Jobs, and Jobs and his ex-girlfriend, and Jobs and everyone else. I highly recommend the film.

As a college senior in '85, watching the iconic "1984" commercial, reading all about SJ & Woz and how they wanted to "change the world", I made it my mission to work at this amazing company. Apple hired me right after graduation and I spent the next 5+ years working with some of the most creative, bright, talented people ever. I was able to attend a few of SJ's employee meetings & product intros before he was unceremoniously "ousted" in that summer of '85, and It was amazing the power he had when he spoke in front of an audience. He's still the best, most evangelical, amazing speaker/presenter/showman I've ever seen. A master, bar none! Can't wait to finish the book and learn more about what drove this amazing man to do all that he did.

Oops! The publishers forgot to include a subtitle, so I've taken the liberty of helping them come up with one. May I suggest:Steve Jobs: Unrelenting Narcissist, Suspected Sociopath and Giant Fucking AssholeIsaacson writes a great biography: He tells a coherent, cohesive story, he interviews all the players and most important he doesn't feel the need to hoist his subject on a pedestal with his pen. When it comes to carrying a story, our author did all the right things.His subject, however, left much to be desired. It's startling to see how someone can be so immensely successful in one aspect of his life and such a complete, utter failure in virtually every other. To illuminate just a few of the many failings of Steve Jobs, allow me to expound upon my proposed subtitle:Unrelenting Narcissist: It's true that if you're going to launch a business in a cutthroat industry and be willing to fight to the death to succeed, you gotta believe in yourself. Jobs, however, took a little positive self-esteem to a whole new level and chose to recreate truth to position himself in the best light. He steals the concept of the GUI from Xerox and it's collaborative sharing, but Microsoft does, well, anything and it's because they're thieves, and we have no respect for thieves. Good ideas? He took credit for them, even if he would veto them upon first review. The man truly believed he could do no wrong, and I can't help but think he probably, just before taking his last breath, was thinking, "Well there goes the future of Apple." Suspected Sociopath: To be clear, I'm using the term "sociopath" like I would if I were Wong's junior psychologist on SVU: that is, to define someone with an anti-social personality disorder. The man - Jobs, not Wong; Wong is amazing - fit the profile to a T: Despite having the ability to charm someone's head off when he needed to, Jobs had an absolute lack of genuine regard for almost everyone around him - his wife, his employees, his poor, cast-aside daughters (his son seemed to escape his scorn, which is a charmingly sexist detail), even his supporters (I can't bring myself to call them friends) who were there for him from the beginning. If a person could not - or could no longer - provide a benefit to Jobs, he would cast them aside...but not before cruelly shitting mounds of aggression and abuse all over their bare heads. See? Sociopath. Giant Fucking Asshole: There are seriously almost too many examples of this to count, but let me curate a sample for your consideration. 1). He screwed one of the founding members of Apple out of founders stock that would now be practically priceless. 2). He thinks he can explain away the abuse he doled out to employees by saying that was "just who I am." Seriously? Do you not think that the people around you want to rip your head off every single day? They do, I assure you. But you know what? They hold it in, because collaborative, encouraging environments are better for everyone (unless you're a narcissist and/or a sociopath, in which case, see above). 3). There's something atrocious about a multi-multi-multi-billionaire who can envision how personal computers/GUIs/the mouse/touchscreens/computer animation/digital music/tablets/etc. can change the world for rich consumers, but who can't see that a fraction of his wealth could have changed the world for people who don't have water. It's undeniable that Jobs was fantastically talented and will go down in the books as one of the great visionaries in history. I'm writing my review on my MacBook, and both my iPhone and my iPad (as well as a slew of iPods, Nanos and Shuffles) are nearby, so I guess the guy was doing something right. Still, I don't believe that being an asshole is the answer, and I don't believe it gets better results; it may not get worse results, but if today's Apple is what he created with vinegar, then I'd love to see what he could have done with honey.

I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss. He was always such a warrior for technological evolution, conceiving products that we didn't know we needed until we held them in our hands. I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket. I now have a playlist for any situation, a wedding, a long drive, robbing a bank, meditation etc. What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative p
I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss. He was always such a warrior for technological evolution, conceiving products that we didn't know we needed until we held them in our hands. I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket. I now have a playlist for any situation, a wedding, a long drive, robbing a bank, meditation etc. What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative person who also had the power to bring a progressive product to life. Good ideas did not die in committee at Apple or Pixar. For some reason conservative leaning people elevate to the highest positions in business in this country. Apple also went through a period of time when Jobs was too radical for a board of directors who wanted to make Apple more like other companies. After reading this biography, I know now that Jobs deserved to be ousted, and what a great occurrence for the world because Pixar would have never been created. He benefited from his time away, learning lessons of consolidating power. When Apple floundered and Jobs was brought back he was much better equipped to lead a company I have always been mystified by the divisions in the country between Apple and Microsoft. I have owned a lot more Apple products than I have PC based products. So without even realizing I guess at some point I joined team Jobs. I used Apples and PCs without really thinking I was being disloyal to a brand, but I have been on the periphery of many heated arguments discussing the merits of PC versus the merits of Macs. I always felt that Jobs was the guy with the concepts and ideas and Gates was sitting around twiddling his thumbs waiting for Jobs to come up with the next "great thing" so he could clone it. There is more truth in that statement than fervent PC believers would like to admit.One of Jobs ex-girlfriends happened to read in a psychiatric manual about Narcissistic personality Disorder and decided that Jobs perfectly met the criteria. "It fit so well and explained so much of what we had struggled with, that I realized expecting him to be nicer or less self-centered was like expecting a blind man to see." Jobs was brutal to his employees, to his family, and to his business partners. One of his favorite lines when looking at a new concept was to say "this is shit". He was a ranter, skilled with skewering insults, contemptuously rude, and yet so sensitive to any slight. When faced with a fond memory or a beautiful concept that he loved he would burst into tears. To say the least, being in the Steve Jobs orbit would have been not only stressful, but confusing. The people that did the best with him were the people that pushed through the "distortion field" that Jobs was nestled in his whole life. For all his failings as a human being and as a boss he was also a talented communicator inspiring people way beyond what they thought they were capable of accomplishing. He firmly believed that nothing was worth doing unless it was going to change the world and that belief was infectious to those that worked with him. When Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer I can remember thinking to myself that no one had ever beaten that form of cancer, but I also thought to myself if anyone can it would be Steve Jobs. His money bought him time. They were able to map the gene of the cancer that was trying to kill him and better target chemo and drugs that would most effectively control the growth of the cancer. "One of his doctors told him that there was hope that his cancer, and others like it, would soon be considered a manageable chronic disease, which could be kept at bay until the patient died of something else." As Jobs said, "I'm either going to be one of the first to be able to outrun a cancer like this, or I'm going to be one of the last to die from it." As we know he lost his battle with cancer, but certainly the money he threw at the disease will end up benefiting all of us. Walter Isaacson is an excellent biographer, I enjoyed his Benjamin Franklin bio very much and intend to read the Einstein biography as well. Steve approached Isaacson to write his biography and Isaacson asked him if he wanted him to write it because he associated himself with Einstein and Franklin. Jobs didn't deny it. He was well aware of his place in history. I liked Steve Jobs more before reading this biography. I have a deeper understanding of how and why he was so successful. I can not emulate his management style nor would I ever want to. He was a destructive personality that inspired creativity. I feel we are diminished by his absence from the ranks and I can only hope there is a young person in a messy garage, tinkering with the concept that will be the next "thing" that will change our lives.

I'm still not entirely sure what to think. I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired.I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there. I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or
I'm still not entirely sure what to think. I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired.I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there. I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or another.On the other hand, I like my personal heroes to have a smidgen of friendly and positive virtues like courtesy and generosity. This book blows away many times over any idea I had that Steve might have been a nice guy at heart with occasional and sometimes very public extremism. The stories related to his daughters and many other women in his personal life nauseated me. I'm frustrated that what I already knew to be his horrifying but effective work attitude also crossed over to his personal life. I appreciate his work and his efforts and he is singlehandedly responsible for me being what I am today, but I despise myself at the moment for having thought this dickless asshole as an awesome role model when I was younger. I wasn't expecting perfection in this regard since we are all human after all, but it was eye opening to see the whole picture in a single book.But that is what I signed up for when I decided to read a no holds barred official bio of Steve, I suppose. Good and bad and worse, all packaged together in a book that is no less beautiful than the products Apple puts out. Tomorrow, I will probably feel bad about this review and feel more inspired by the positive aspects of this bio to push myself harder to work better and to do what is right, like Steve would have done. Then the next day I will be frustrated that he didn't have surgery sooner and think about the what ifs. Rinse, repeat.edit: Tomorrow is today... and Mona's eulogy for her brother is in the NYT (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opi...). I think that wonderful eulogy brought more tears to my eyes than this bio or even his death did. Short, simple but beautiful, and more importantly, shows me another side of Steve that is more like the person I thought he was before I read the bio. The side that cared about his family but was hindered by the cancer, spreading and getting worse. Thanks for restoring my faith, Mona.

Well, The mighty Steve Jobs that we have so much to learn from.The bookWalter Isaacson the author is a well-know writer (Einstein, Franklin are his other biography books) has covered all the aspects of Job's life from his childhood, family, friends, to founding apple with Wozniak, each product design (Macintosh, iphone etc.) and venture (Next, Pixar) he conveyed. The book has benefited a lot from articulation of Walter Isaacson and the content are precise with rich details as he has interviewed all the people he's named in the book as well as Steve Job.The best thing about reading biographies and the very reason why I love biographies is the lessons you can learn from the bests. Having a business guru like jobs as a mentor is a blessing not everyone can have and fortunately enough, biographies makes this dream come close to reality. So here are the best things I've learned about Jobs:Jobs Core Personality Traits and Management Ethics1. Jobs was an abandoned child, and when he asked his mom and dad if his real parents didn't want him, they repeated slowly: "We specifically picked you out". So, abandoned, chosen, special, became part of what Jobs regarded himself of. 2. From early in childhood, his dad who was a skilled mechanic would take him to show him how repairing is done. He would point out to him the detailing of the designs, lines, vents etc. Jobs also watched his father a lot using his skills in negotiations when bargaining the parts he wanted to purchase. These experience with his father instilled within him persuasion skills and attention to details that came in handy later in his career.3. Another impacting force on Jobs views was his childhood search of neighborhood exposing him to simple, smart, cheap houses that were build by Joseph Eichler. From these exposures and later his Zen practices, he developed an orientation towards simplicity that influenced later all his ideas and designs. 4. A core personality trait of Jobs which had a significant impact on all his achievements was him being relentless on getting what he needed or what he deemed to be right:That summer of 1972, after his graduation, he and Brennan moved to a cabin in the hills above Los Altos. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go live in a cabin with Chrisann,‚Äù he announced to his parents one day. His father was furious. ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOver my dead body.‚Äù They had recently fought about marijuana, and once again the younger Jobs was willful. He just said good-bye and walked out.One day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and wanted to be hired there, and told the personnel director, who was startled by his unkempt hair and attire, that he wouldn‚Äôt leave until they gave him a job. :D 5. Perhaps the boldest of Jobs traits was his Reality Distortion Field which made him believe what seemed utterly impossible to others and he would always persist that something odd could be done and interestingly enough, he would be often right. 6. He would refuse to accept automatically received truths, and he wanted to examine everything himself. 7. Jobs had came to belief that he could impart his feeling of confidence to others and thus push them to do things they hadn't thought possible8. A remarkable thing that helped Jobs what he eventually became was his engagement with many great people and mentors and getting into different businesses and careers. For instance:The Atari experience helped shape Jobs‚Äôs approach to business and design. He appreciated the user friendliness of Atari‚Äôs insert-quarter-avoid-Klingons games. ‚ÄúThat simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person,‚Äù said Ron Wayne. Jobs also absorbed some of Bushnell‚Äôs take-non-prisoners attitude. ‚ÄúNolan wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer,‚Äù according to Alcorn, ‚Äúand this was Steve‚Äôs first impression of how things got done. Nolan was never abusive, like Steve sometimes is. But he had the same driven attitude. It made me cringe, but dammit, it got things done. In that way Nolan was a mentor for Jobs.‚Äù 9. Bushnell tought Jobs:I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, ‚ÄòPretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.10. Mark Markukula another mentor of Jobs taught him:You should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last. And that is precisely what Job did with apple. He always thought product not profit. Markulla instilled in Jobs the apple philosophy which revolves around three core principles as follows:I. Empathy: an intimate connection with the feelings of customers and understanding their needs.II. Focus: To do what must be done, every other unimportant opportunities must me eliminated. III. Impute: People from an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it onveys. "People DO judge a book by its cover." If you present your great product in a slipshod manner, it they will be perceived as slipshod.11. From Alan Kay a Xerox mighty scientist Jobs embraced and applied two Maxims:I. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.II. People who are serious about software should make their own hardware.12. A great thing I've noticed being the root of many extraordinary feats has been this:Because I didn't know how it couldn't be done, I was enabled to do it.13. Jobs has been an all-time perfectionist and always complaint that young generation has no such quality ingrained in them.14. Jobs would never compromise quality and perfection in favor of lowering the costs, nor would he care about how much longer the project would be delayed to meet his expectations.15. Jobs would always argue that "By expecting people to do great things, you can get them to do great things." This actually has proven psychological roots. 16. From Bill Atkinson: "Great art stretches the taste, it doesn't follow the tastes."17. "No, because customers don't know what they want until we've shown them", this is what Jobs kept replying whoever suggested doing some market research.18. The journey is the reward. Jobs favorite maxim which too has proven neuropsychological roots. As soon as you reach your goal, the joy vanishes. (Look up dopamine working mechanism and its effects if interested).19. Another Job's favorite maxim was: "It's better to be a pirate than to join te navy." He wanted to instill a rebel spirit in his team to have them behave like swashbucklers who were proud of their work but willing to commandeer from others.20. Sculley former PEPSI, the first apple CEO had a weakness to manage a dysfunctional company was his desire to please other people, one of many traits that he did not share with Jobs:We would go to the Mac building at eleven at night,‚Äù Sculley recalled, ‚Äúand they would bring Jobs code to show. In some cases he wouldn‚Äôt even look at it. He would just take it and throw it back at them. I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHow can you turn it down?‚Äô And he would say, ‚ÄòI know they can do better.‚Äô‚Äù21. Microsoft followed a different philosophy, their initial products were often clumsy, but they were extremely persistent, so they kept improving and improving their works.22. Jobs had a profound emphasis on recruiting only and only A players:Jobs had latched onto what he believed was a key management lesson from his Macintosh experience: You have to be ruthless if you want to build a team of A players. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too easy, as a team grows, to put up with a few B players, and they then attract a few more B players, and soon you will even have some C players,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúThe Macintosh experience taught me that A players like to work only with other A players, which means you can‚Äôt indulge B players.‚Äù23. As I traversed through the book, I noticed several things contributing to Jobs ability to come up with ideas:I. He always have been on the edge of the technology and art, aware what's the latest achievements of scientific and artistic communities.II. He actively would canvass academics to inquire them on their needs and shortcoming to see if he could come up with a solution.III. Part of his routines what holding occasional retreats with top 100 managers to a resort and keep brainstorming ideas and selecting top 3 out of n+1 proposed ones. 24. What prepared Jobs for great success was getting fired from apple in act I, starting the "Next" venture and indulging and failing in any type of projects he desire. In short, his failures made him the "Steve" we know on act III (which is returning to apple).25. This one is a bit dark: When he wanted to acquire something that others wouldn't let go of (like his daughter Lisa from his ex-wife) he would spark off a destructive route of ignorance. In case of his daughter, he undermined his ex's effectiveness and her well being to get Lisa to move into his house. 26. A lesson Jobs learned from his Buddhist days was that material possessions often cluttered life than enriched it. 27. One thing the Jobs believed lead to the down fall of apple after he left the company with Sculley was that "Sculley destroyed apple by bringing in corrupt people and corrupt values," "They cared about making money for themselves mainly, and also for apple, rather than making great products. 28. If Jobs new for sure a course of action was right, he was unstoppable. But if he had doubts, he sometimes withdrew, preferring not to thinking about things that did not perfectly suit him.29. Job's ambition was to build a company that would endure, and he asked Markulla what the formula for that would be. Markulla replied that lasting companies know ho to reinvent themselves.30. A beautiful phrase I read was Job saying: We at apple have forgotten who we were. 
One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.
31. One of Jobs greatest strength was knowing how to focus. "Deciding what not to o is as important as deciding what to do," he said. "That's true for companies, and it's true for products."After a few weeks Jobs finally had enough. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù he shouted at one big product strategy session. ‚ÄúThis is crazy.‚Äù He grabbed a magic marker, padded to a whiteboard, and drew a horizontal and vertical line to make a four-squared chart. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we need,‚Äù he continued. Atop the two columns he wrote ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù and ‚ÄúPro‚Äù; he labeled the two rows ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù and ‚ÄúPortable.‚Äù Their job, he said, was to make four great products, one for each quadrant. ‚ÄúThe room was in dumb silence,‚Äù Schiller recalled. There was also a stunned silence when Jobs presented the plan to the September meeting of the Apple board. ‚ÄúGil had been urging us to approve more and more products every meeting,‚Äù Woolard recalled. ‚ÄúHe kept saying we need more products. Steve came in and said we needed fewer. He drew a matrix with four quadrants and said that this was where we should focus.‚Äù At first the board pushed back. It was a risk, Jobs was told. ‚ÄúI can make it work,‚Äù he replied. The board never voted on the new strategy. Jobs was in charge, and he forged ahead. 32. Jobs used and benefited a lot from his tuition. In case of designs, he would point to models and sketches he liked and dump on the ones he didn't. 33. Perhaps one of the greatest maxims Jobs wove into fabric of apple's designs was Davincii's mantra: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."It take a lot of hard work He said, "to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions." As Ive remarkably uttered:  Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn‚Äôt just a visual style. It‚Äôs not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it‚Äôs manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential. 34. To make Ive's aesthetic desires and various design whims come into reality, Jobs had to fend off the objections of the manufacturing engineers. 
When we took the designs to the engineers, Jobs said, they came up with thirty-eight reasons they couldn't do it. And I said, 'No, no, we're doing this.' And they said, 'Well, why?' And I said, 'Because I'm the CEO, and I think it can be done.' And so they kind of grudgingly did it.
35. Jobs followed this strategy that made apple successful the whole time: Make hit product and promote them with terrific marketing. 36. Steve firmly deemed motivation to be crucial: The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don‚Äôt really love music or art the way we do. We won because we personally love music. We made the iPod for ourselves, and when you‚Äôre doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you‚Äôre not going to cheese out. If you don‚Äôt love something, you‚Äôre not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much. 37. One of Jobs's business rules was to never be afraid of cannibalizing yourself. If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will, he said.38. In designing products, apple would come up several models, pick one, and keep refining them till it seemed perfect. 39. He believed (and recently have been advocated by many creativity gurus) that creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they're doing, you say 'Wow,' and soon you're cooking up all sorts of ideas. So apple designed his building to promote random encounters of employees who would not be aware of each other otherwise. 40. What made iphone successful was simplifying things that was complex to deal with in other phones.41. Jobs had his theory on why great companies like IBM decline. "The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don't matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. After all as Dylan says: 
If you're not busy being born, you're busy dying.
Strange and funny facts about Jobs1. He was always walking around barefoot,‚Äù he later told a reporter. ‚ÄúThe thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.‚Äù Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. ‚ÄúOne of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.‚Äù2. Just because Jobs tells you that something is awful or great, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he‚Äôll feel that way tomorrow,‚Äù Tribble explained. ‚ÄúIf you tell him a new idea, he‚Äôll usually tell you that he thinks it‚Äôs stupid. But then, if he actually likes it, exactly one week later, he‚Äôll come back to you and propose your idea to you, as if he thought of it. :)))3. An event ran in apple to award the person who stood up to Jobs and for what he/she believes. :D4. A nice reply once Jobs gave to a reporter when was asked "Why is your Next device gonna be so late?" was: "It's not late, its gonna be five years ahead of its time."5. The "i" in apple's naming was to emphasize that the devices would be seamlessly integrated with the internet. 6. Jobs sometimes avoided the truth. Helmut Sonnenfeldt once said of Henry Kissinger, ‚ÄúHe lies not because it‚Äôs in his interest, he lies because it‚Äôs in his nature.‚Äù It was in Jobs‚Äôs nature to mislead or be secretive when he felt it was warranted. But he also indulged in being brutally honest at times, telling the truths that most of us sugarcoat or suppress. Both the dissembling and the truth-telling were simply different aspects of his Nietzschean attitude that ordinary rules didn‚Äôt apply to him.7. Jobs frequently encouraged youths to try LSD as it's been amongst his most influential experiences...Hope you enjoyed :)

In a way, I regard this book as a balanced biography. Even though Walter Isaacson is apparently unsatisfied with having gotten all of Steve Jobs's shaft into his mouth and spends a lot of time sucking on Jobs's balls, his recounting of Steve Jobs's behavior left me unavoidably with the impression that Steve Jobs was a world-class asshole. Jobs is presented as so much of a whining, pathetic bully that I find myself glad that he died of pancreatic cancer, and I also find myself regretting that he did not die sooner.[paragraph listing instances of Jobs's assholish behavior]In Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, the sentence "Glanton spat." appears almost like a refrain in a song. Glanton does a lot of spitting. In Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs, the clause "Jobs cried" appears with the same frequency. Jobs does a lot of crying. Jobs would cry any time he didn't get his way. His tendency to cry makes me wish I--as technically inept as Jobs himself--could bully someone cleverer than I into building a time machine, so I could use it to go back in time and beat the crap out of Steve Jobs.He fucked over Woz.He continually told people that they were shit.He was duped by John Sculley.He held people in contempt when they didn't behave like assholes.He demanded that a machine in a factory be painted. It fucked up the machine.On The Subject of Jobs's 30th Birthday Party--------------------------------------------"Many people had picked out special gifts for a person who was not easy to shop for. Debi Coleman, for example, found a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Last Tycoon'. But Jobs, in an act that was odd yet not out of character, left all of the gifts in a hotel room."page 189For contrast, on my 30th birthday I bought myself a dog toy in the shape of a plush shotgun shell. It squeaked when you squeezed it. My sister's then-boyfriend did some repairs on my car, which was really nice of him. My point is that Steve Jobs is an inconsiderate asshole.It's kind of fun to read this book if you think of it as a drinking game where you drink every time Steve Jobs is an asshole. You'd be dead of alcohol poisoning by page 10 if you actually drank every time Isaacson reported an instance of Steve Jobs being an asshole. But it's kind of fun to be surprised on every page by a new way in which Jobs is an asshole. Jobs is an inexhaustible genius of finding ways to be an asshole. Look at this shit, from page 188:[...] Andy Cunningham, from Regis McKenna's firm, was in charge of hand-holding and logistics at the Carlyle. When Jobs arrived, he told her that his suite needed to be completely redone, even though it was 10 p.m. and the meetings were to begin the next day. The piano was not in the right place; the strawberries were the wrong type. But his biggest objection was that he didn't like the flowers. He wanted calla lilies. "We got into a big fight on what a calla lily is," Cunningham recalled. "I know what they are, because I had them at my wedding, but he insisted on having a different type of lily and said I was 'stupid' because I didn't know what a real calla lily was." So Cunningham went out and, this being New York, was able to find a place open at midnight where she could get the lilies he wanted. By the time they got the room rearranged, Jobs started objecting to what she was wearing. "That suit's disgusting," he told her. Cunningham knew that at times he just simmered with undirected anger, so she tried to calm him down. "Look, I know you're angry, and I know how you feel," she said.""You have no fucking idea how I feel," he shot back, "no fucking idea what it's like to be me."I'll tell you what it feels like to be Steve Jobs: it feels like you're a fucking asshole.[All of page 462 should be included here, to show what an asshole Jobs is, even after he has had cancer.]This book could also have been called The Crying Asshole. See for yourself:Page 197: "Then he began to cry."Steve Jobs, a cause of crying in others as well as himself: "After Jobs stalked out, Sculley turned away from the glass wall of his office, where others had been looking in on the meeting, and wept." (page 199)Page 202: "He went back to his office, gathered his longtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff, and started to cry."Page 206: 'It finally sank in. Jobs realized there was no appeal, no way to warp the reality. He broke down in tears and started making phone calls--to Bill Campbell, Jay Elliot, Mike Murray, and others. Murray's wife, Joyce., was on an overseas call when Jobs phoned, and the operator broke in saying it was an emergency. It better be important, she told the operator. "It is," she heard Jobs say. When her husband got on the phone, Jobs was crying. "It's over," he said. Then he hung up.'See? Crying and callously breaking into someone else's expensive overseas phone call because you couldn't hack it.Page 208: Years later Jobs's eyes welled with tears as he recounted the story [...]Page 442: They all hugged, and Jobs wept.-------------------------------------------Part II of this ReviewIsaacson's biography is soft and untechnical, and that's a real shame because it's the anointed-by-Steve-Jobs-himself biography that, at least for the moment, is the Steve Jobs biography of record.Isaacson is not up to the task of explaining what Jobs did when he was at NeXT. That's a shame, because Jobs's work at NeXT forms the basis for everything that Apple is today.There are a couple of reasons an author might want to avoid trying to explain what Jobs did at NeXT. The main reason is that it's fucking complicated. The other reason is that it's boring for most people to read about. (Take it from me, a paid technical writer.) I suspect that Isaacson does not have the technical understanding necessary to explain why the NeXT years were important. It would have taken months and possibly as much as a couple of years for Isaacson to develop the understanding he would need to explain how NeXT was different, and what it made possible that wasn't possible before. Clearly Isaacson didn't find that appealing. Also, probably most of the reading public doesn't want to read a highly technical explanation of the innovations that went into the NeXT operating system.But that means that this book fails to describe the major achievement of Jobs's life. This is probably going to be the biography of record for Steve Jobs. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine how shitty this is.For comparison, Isaacson spends five pages (411-415) describing the contents of Jobs's playlist. Isaacson even talks about how he and Jobs sat around listening to the music on Jobs's iPad2, and reports things that Jobs says about the songs he's listening to. Except for when Jobs is yelling at people for stupid bullshit, he never seems more common in this biography than when he is saying dumb wistful stuff about Boomer music on his iPad2.Here's Jobs, bloviating about The Beatles while listening to the recording sessions for "Strawberry Fields Forever":It's a complex song, and it's fascinating to watch the creative process as they went back and forth and finally created it over a few months. Lennon was always my favorite Beatle. [He laughs as Lennon stops during the first take and makes the band go back and revise a chord.] Did you hear that little detour they took? It didn't work, so they went back and started from where they were. It's so raw in this version. It actually makes them sound like mere mortals. You could actually imagine other people doing this, up to this version. Maybe not writing and conceiving it, but certainly playing it. Yet they just didn't stop. They were such perfectionists they keep it going and going. This made a big impression on me when I was in my thirties. You could just tell how much they worked at this.They did a bundle of work between each of these recordings. They kept sending it back to make it closer to perfect. [As he listens to the third take, he points out how the instrumentation has gotten more complex.] The way we build stuff at Apple is often this way. Even the number of models we'd make of a new notebook or iPod. We would start off with a version and then begin refining and refining, doing detailed models of the design, or the buttons, or how a function operates. It's a lot of work, but in the end it just gets better, and soon it's like, "Wow, how did they do that?!? Where are the screws?"pp.418-419So there's Steve Jobs, convincing himself that he invented iterative design because he heard the Beatles do something like it. It's kind of like how Eddie Van Halen says that he realized he could tap when he was at a Led Zeppelin concert and he saw Jimmy Page play the open G string and then hammer on the A on the second fret over and over again. Except in this case, it has nothing to do with guitar playing and everything to do with Steve Jobs convincing himself that he invented iterative design and then cramming his own cock into his throat. The only real consolation to be had in this story is that pancreatic cancer is eating him.-----------------------Part III of this ReviewIsaacson has an easier time of explaining the end of Jobs's life, because he stays away from technical material and focuses on easy-to-understand numbers that tell easy-to-understand stories. Here's an example, from the part of the book describing when Jobs convinced Disney to buy Pixar:The deal the proposed was that Disney would purchase Pixar for $7.4 billion in stock. Jobs would thus become Disney's largest shareholder, with approximately 7% of the company's stock compared to 1.7% owned by Eisner and 1$ by Roy Disney. Disney Animation would be put under Pixar, with Lasseter and Catmull running the combined unit. Pixar would retain its independent identity, its studio and headquarters would remain in Emeryville, and it would even keep its own email addresses.(p.441)This story's pretty straightforward: Jobs is rich, and then he gets richer. That's a lot easier to understand than the technical innovations of NeXT. And it's in the book, unlike the technical part of the NeXT years.When discussing Apple's decision to dump the PowerPC and move to Intel microprocessors, Issacson gets about as technical as he ever gets:Bill Gates was amazed. Designing crazy-colored cases did not impress him, but a secret program to switch the CPU in a computer, completed seamlessly and on time, was a feat he truly admired. "If you'd said 'Okay, we're going to change our microprocessor chip, and we're not going to lose a beat,' that sounds impossible," he told me years later, when I asked him about Jobs's accomplishments. "They basically did that."(p.448)I want to make sure to point out some examples of Isaacson sucking the cock of Steve Jobs, to bolster my claim that this is less a biography and more an advertisement for Steve Jobs. So here's a paragraph lifted verbatim from a part of the book where Isaacson is reporting on Steve Jobs's 2005 Stanford commencement speech:The artful minimalism of the speech gave it simplicity, purity, and charm. Search where you will, from anthologies to YouTube, and you won't find a better commencement address. Others may have been more important, such as George Marshall's at Harvard in 1947 announcing a plan to rebuild Europe, but none has had more grace.(page 457)Slurp, slurp, slurp.---UPDATE 09 Feb 2014---Virtuous men, busy in the affairs of life, and occupied continually in the saying of virtuous words and the doing of virtuous deeds, are apt to lose track of one lone expression of virtue, however excellent and meritorious, amid the endless succession of righteous and virtuous actions of which their admirable and praiseworthy lives consist. And so it is with unfeigned gratitude that I greet the comment of Hazem Bayado, who, upon seeing my excellent review of Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs, was moved to express this:How can one hate a review here!! While the reviewer mentioned some important points, in particular the NeXT years, or the absence of them actually, I found his continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting and generally degrading for the review. Ok so Steve Jobs was an asshole in your mind, but what do you call someone who is happy and satisfied about the fact that cancer is eating another human alive? Asshole is an understatement!!!Hazem Bayado's comment brought again to my attention the nearly-forgotten review of Steve Jobs that I composed last May, and thereby afforded me the opportunity to be pleased and delighted by my assessment of the character of Steve Jobs, and to marvel at how correct I was at so tender and green an age, when my judgment was much younger and less-tried than it is today.I should like to take this opportunity to dedicate myself anew to the proposition I articulated here eight months ago to the amusement and enlightenment of so many, that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Why, just the other day, Mark Ames reported that Steve Jobs was involved in a conspiracy to drive down the wages of developers in Silicon Valley: http://goo.gl/C9FBnp. Truly, this is a genius asshole, a Tupac of assholery, to continue from beyond the grave to give reporters material for new reports of assholery of kinds heretofore undared. What fool, having been presented with this information, would gainsay the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole? What depravity could give rise to such foolishness?I am sorry that Hazem Bayado found my "continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting, and generally degrading for the review", but I do wish him well.Is it too much to hope that Hazem Bayado will be able to suck greater command of the English language out of a dick? I do hope it isn't, because all people of parts, with their faculties keen to the happenings of the world, can not fail to mark, and can probably not refrain from remaking upon, just how very much he sucks dick. I hope that he manages to suck greater command of the English language out of one of the endless parade of dicks that marches down his throat, so that he may be less a target of sport for those of us with greater command of the tongue.In closing, I can see nothing to alter my earlier judgment, and it is with a great sense of pride that I sustain that earlier judgment and re-dedicate myself to the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Thank you, Hazem Bayado, for allowing me to spend time in the company of my former self, admiring his courage and revelling in the wisdom of his superior judgment.------------------------23 Oct 2015In writing Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson has created a long, posthumous public-relations-style press release for Steve Jobs. In doing this, he has done one of two things. (1) Isaacson has acquiesced to becoming a part of Jobs's strategy to draw attention away from substantive and historical questions that show Jobs in a negative light and worked to draw attention toward easily-understood narratives that show Jobs in a positive light and that are accessible to the average reader. (2) Isaacson has cluelessly been manipulated by Steve Jobs into becoming a part of the strategy to show Jobs in a positive light, giving attention to popular matters of little substance at the expense of substantive technical questions and historically important business dealings. Neither option increases Isaacson's credibility as a biographer.Episodes 42 and 43 of the podcast "Hypercritical" by John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin discuss the technical shallowness of Isaacson's biography of Jobs: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42 http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43Mark Ames has covered "Techtopus", a wage-fixing scam orchestrated by Google and Steve Jobs. Whatever Isaacson has written in his biography about Jobs's appreciation of The Beatles or his having dating Joni Mitchell or his white-boy, tourist love of India, whatever he has written is simply public relations, and will remain hopelessly so for as long as he adds no examination of Jobs's role in wage-fixing: https://pando.com/tag/techtopus/Randall Strouss's Steve Jobs and The Next Big Thing remains the book of record for getting a foundation in the innovations of NeXT. The absence of substantive examination of NeXT in Isaacson's book combined with the attention given to Jobs's musical preferences demonstrates the unseriousness of Isaacson's biography. Here's Strouss's book, which as a kind of bonus has the best single-chapter introduction to the innovations of Xerox in the 1970s at the Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...

Update: I 'did' read this a ways back - my friend gave me her book when done--her husband is still living - a Survivor of pancreatic cancer! Doing well! At the time when I read this - I was actually wanting to read as much as I could about the his cancer -( because of my friend John).There wasn't enough to pull anything from---yet-I was fascinated with everything else. Nobody has made a bigger difference in the quality of people's lives, in my lifetime, than Steve Jobs. It bothered me though that the criticism about him was a little too repetitive for me-it kept being driven home.So... in updating this old review today, my reason in doing so, is that I just finished listening to another Steve Jobs book which I enjoyed -Becoming Steve Jobs".If there are still people who have not read any biography, or seen any movie, about Steve Jobs....I think you're missing out by not doing so. He was the visionary leader in our lifetime that made the biggest difference to the most amount of people.OLD NEWS:I'm not sure when I'll read this book ---(I've got others to read first)---but my friend has pancreatic cancer ---(the SAME TYPE as Steve Jobs). Enough inspiration to want me to read this book.John also lives in the same town as the Jobs family...(only a few miles away) ---John is another GREAT mind, ---a psychiatrist for 40 years ---(Harvard Educated) Married 40 years -- 2 adult daughters --- 2 twin grand sons. I'm sad Steve Jobs died...he was brilliant --(would have loved to see things he would have continued to create for another 40 years)

I started this book with two questions: Was Steve Jobs an asshole? And if so... did he need to be to accomplish what he did?Having just finished it, I don't have a good answer to either question. In fact both seem foolishly simplistic given this rich, sweeping, detailed, and intimate depiction a truly remarkable man's life experience.What I learned about Steve Jobs is that he was very good at some things, and very bad at others. Among the things he was very good at, his true genius lay in his ability to develop products people love at the intersection of engineering and humanities. Later in life he shifted more of his energies toward building a company that institutionalized this genius, though it will be a while before we learn whether he succeeded.What I learned about life - or about business, anyway - is that both our strengths and our weaknesses shape the things we create. What's remarkable about the life of Steve Jobs is how the psychoses and eccentricities of his personality, when channelled through his defining product genius, created the world's most valuable company. His is not the story of a man overcoming the limitations of his worldview; it's the story of a man who changed the world itself to accomodate it.You are not Steve Jobs, as Allen Kelly pointed out in his insightful blog post a few weeks back. But maybe there's a lesson for all of us in the story of a man who brought some beauty into the world not just because of the gifts that made him a genius, but because of the flaws and idiosyncrasies that made him a person.

Along with Steve the brilliant innovator who knew how to bring together an A-list team of loyal employees, we get Steve the rude man who will proclaim a product or food or wedding invitation as "shit" and then walk away with a clear conscience; Steve the man who has no qualms about crying in front of others if he doesn't get his way or is overburdened; Steve the selfish man who doesn't bother to remember birthdays or anniversaries; Steve the lousy father who denied fathering his first daughter for the first six years of her life, and who wasn't there much for his three children with Powell. I was surprised when I learned that Jobs was not only cooperating with Isaacson on this book, but sought him out. Steve explained that it was because he wanted his children to truly know their father, and I'm so glad that I got to know him, too.

Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine. I hate Time Magazine.He prefers telling to showing in his prose, reminds us of his theses whenever they apply, and conveys emotion via bludgeoning, shallow diction. It's that last point that most bothers me, since it leaked into his disappointing performance as an interviewer as well: for instance, he notes dozens of times that someone wept after some event but does not follow up with questions of "why? would you have reacted that way now? how do
Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine. I hate Time Magazine.He prefers telling to showing in his prose, reminds us of his theses whenever they apply, and conveys emotion via bludgeoning, shallow diction. It's that last point that most bothers me, since it leaked into his disappointing performance as an interviewer as well: for instance, he notes dozens of times that someone wept after some event but does not follow up with questions of "why? would you have reacted that way now? how do you think this affected others? how did that influence your decision-making? etc."When Isaacson turned‚Äîrarely‚Äîto analysis, interpretation, and abstraction, he provided little additional depth. The author rarely examined his subject's assertions and ideologies critically. This book, then, is useful not so much as a biography but rather as simply a primary source of quotations and accounts. That's tragic because it's almost certainly the best one we're going to get, yet because of its focus on products over people, it's missing so, so much.Why did Jobs seem to prefer Reed to his daughters? How did Laurene put up with his behavior, and to what extent did she think it necessary to his accomplishments? Did Jobs feel that the ends justify the means with respect to his products, or did he simply fail to notice his often-nasty means? Did he believe that one must behave interpersonally with moral disregard to achieve as he did; if so, why? How would he explain Cook's success via absolutely orthogonal style? How did Laurene feel about his lingering feeling for Redse? What would his board say to the author's implied allegation that they are essentially his puppets?There is so much fascinating depth to Jobs's story that is simply not considered. It's this depth and understanding, I feel, that matters: after all, aren't all of us reading this biography because we wish we could replicate Jobs's achievements, yearn to walk a vicarious mile in his shoes, wonder just how much it cost him? Having finished the book, I'm left wondering whether I have trouble empathizing with Jobs because I simply can't understand his moral and rational framework‚Äîor because Isaacson's account is so frustratingly impersonal and shallow.

Are you a fan of APPLE? Do you hate APPLE? Did you admire Steve Jobs? Did you hate Steve Jobs? No matter your answers, you *really* should read this book. There have been things about APPLE I always disliked. This book made me turn many of these things into things I no longer dislike, but also into things I now understand and yes, even admire. There was many many things I learned in here that I had no clue about. There is no way I think you can read this book and not just totally be in awe of Jobs. Yes, he was a total asshole. It's also clear that he never made apologizes for this. He has some very obvious personal issues. Professional issues as well. What I never understood is what drove him. After reading this, I feel very sure that money was never a driving force in his life. Instead it was always his passions. His passions for PIXAR. His passion for APPLE. His passion to always be the best. Read this book. I am not sure that I've ever read a book that showed a man with such passions. No, this book is not always a nice pretty picture of Jobs. In fact, at times you will think he is complete shit. You will hate him for how he treats his employees. You will marvel at how he justifies his backhanded business ethics. You will stare open mouthed at his tantrums....but through it all, you can't help but to marvel at the man. At all he accomplished. At how he never gave up, no matter who told him it couldn't be done. You will marvel at how he pushes others into greatness. You will wish you could have experienced his "reality distortion field". I also learned so much about APPLE.....I learned and now understand their "closed system" I used to really hate this about APPLE...now I am excited about it....You will understand why they really DID change the world that you and I now know. How many things that Jobs pushed that you don't even realize...but things you would be hard pressed to do without. I wish I had read this book years ago. I wish I had been an APPLE fanatic years ago. I wish I had bothered to learn more about Jobs before his passing. I wish everyone knew just what he did for APPLE. The story about APPLE that I really never knew when he came back to it's helm. Again, no matter what your feelings about the man or the company, this is a book worth reading. If you walk away not learning anything new....well, I would surprised. If you walk away without being a little bit awestruck with the man...well, I would be surprised. Brilliant man.....there is no question....there will never be another like him....and just one more thing.....you shall be missed......you left your mark on us all, Steve.....job well done.....RIP.....

To date all my computer fanship has been geared towards Linus Torvalds and Linux, even though (for now) I limp along grumpily with Windows. Steve Jobs and Apple? Pah! I couldn't bear the snobbish one-upmanship rantings of Apple and it's aficionados. It was therefore with some hesitancy I approached Steve Jobs's biography. Someone I follow here at GR had recommended it, plus it had been sitting on a shelf in the library forever and I kept bumping into it.So, in spite of my reservations I took it out....and it rewarded me by flying in the face my prejudice. I absolutely loved it ... Walter Isaacson is a superb writer, and in spite of the fact that Jobs was one of the most prickly and outspoken people on the planet - he has done a brilliant job in researching this abrasive genius. And it turns out, after all, that that Steve Jobs was a genius. He often talked to his staff insultingly, or treated them like idiots; he often stole their ideas, or gave them impossible deadlines - at one stage he even wanted them all to wear a uniform. But they kept coming back for more. He had such passion and drive, artistry and originality..... Nothing but perfection would do. Plus he was the ultimate iconic figure of cool. He inspired enormous loyalty in his workforce, and in all those who bought a piece of Apple magic. As Daniel Lyons of Newsweek Magazine said ""He has an uncanny ability to cook up gadgets that we didn't know we needed, but then suddenly can't live without".To read about the life, creativity and development of this man was fascinating. I'm still a Linux person. I ain't no Apple groover. But now I'm prepared to doff my hat to this extraordinary man and his mind-boggling achievements. For all his shortcomings he was a giant in our landscape. I also want to read more books by Walter Isaacson.

I am a little surprised this book ended up being such a disappointment.

I am a little surprised this book ended up being such a disappointment. Walter Isaacson just doesn't know that much about the tech industry and, despite the opportunity and access, didn't learn enough to make it interesting. The one saving grace was the participation of Steve Jobs, his friends, and family, and this alone rescues the book from a lower rating. Granted, this biography is meant for a mass audience, not someone who is a regular listener of Apple podcasts (yes, like me). The early chapters are fine, though others have pointed out it's largely cribbed from previous books. I was the least familiar with this era, and especially unaware to the extent Jobs was... sorry, it's only way to put this: a fucking whiny little bitch. Every few pages he's crying to get what he wants. Seriously.It's the second half that was a bigger letdown, at least in regard to the inside story of Apple's business decisions and where products are concerned. Sure, there's plenty here, but it's out of chronological order, difficult to follow, and there are big gaps. Isaacson is better at writing about Jobs the individual than he is about Jobs the businessman, and let's not forget that's why we know or care who Steve Jobs was. If you're looking for much more detail than the order in which Apple signed music companies to the iTunes Store, you may be similarly disappointed. If you don't know much more than the broad outlines of Steve Jobs' career, this may be a perfectly worthwhile read. That said, there's also plenty Isaacson gets wrong; I defer to John Siracusa on specific errors and omissions by Isaacson, and as of this writing he's only halfway there: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42

Walter Isaacson often uses the word "prickly" in reference to Steve Jobs's personality and management style. Remove the "ly" and you'll be closer to the truth. 'Nuff said.

Full Review
If you ask people their opinion of Steve Jobs, you may get a wide variety of answers. To many he was this brilliant innovator and designer, with a cult-like following. To me though, he's largely been an overpraised Asshole who got more credit than he deserved. This book has changed my opinions somewhat. 1) He's a larger asshole than even I thought. 2) He does deserves more of the credit that I was was willing to give him for several key impacts to technology and culture.I earn my living as a Software Engineer. My love of computers came at an early age. My first computer: An Apple IIgs. I came to learn this was basically a souped up version of the original Apple II with improvements borrowed from the Macintosh after that failed to be a success and Steve Jobs was maneuvered out of power at Apple.While to most people that will never be a device of significance, it changed my life. I still have it. I still love it. It's also the only Apple product I've ever owned, and I wasn't the one who bought it, my parents were. I've always had a hate/love relationship with Apple. I can appreciate the innovations of many Apple products: The Mac, The iPod, iPhone and iPad. But I've never wanted to own one. I find the closed nature of their products and lack of customization frustrating and a deal breaker. Steve Wozniak is my favorite Apple Steve, not Mr. Jobs.Without Steve Jobs, some of these products may never have come to be, and certainly not as early. And they certainly wouldn't have been Apple products. He didn't really design or innovate much though. What he did was push his talented engineers to innovate and accomplish things even they didn't think possible. He largely did this by being an asshole. Constantly. Calling people's ideas shit one week then taking credit for them as his own the next. Oh and that doesn't get into all the issues he had as a father or friend.I could never have worked for Apple or Jobs. I probably wouldn't have been up to his standards anyways. As a huge computer/technology fan though, this is a must read book. Like him or hate him you can't disregard his impact on not only technology but culture.My Windows PC (or Linux PC for that matter) wouldn't be the same without the Mac (although I think far too many people are unaware of the innovations of Xerox PARC engineers). My Android phone wouldn't be nearly as good without the iPhone.My favorite quote from this book came from Bill Gates who said something to the effect that a closed system can work, but only with Jobs at the helm. I think Apple without Steve Jobs isn't nearly as good. I don't think that's because Tim Cook isn't an asshole though. It's because what Steve Jobs had was vision, and good taste for design. Not to mention amazing showmanship. I just don't like his products. But Apple fans are legion, and for good reason.The Open vs. Closed debate rages on. Both sides have their merits. First it was Apple and Microsoft, now Apple and Google. I'm firmly on the open side, but understand why the closed side is so popular/successful.Now it feels like innovation has largely stalled as companies are trying to push several technologies (I'm looking at you Smart Watches) that no one seems to really want or care about, and releasing only minor upgrades in hardware and software every year, rather than doing anything groundbreaking. I just hope Apple can start innovating again soon, because we can use the competition again.Steve Jobs was a complicated person. I'm thankful for his contributions to technology. I'm also thankful I never knew him.

Since his death in October, those of us who use Apple products and/or have a strong interest in technology have read various obituaries, tributes in blogs, and reviews of the Isaacson book.

Since his death in October, those of us who use Apple products and/or have a strong interest in technology have read various obituaries, tributes in blogs, and reviews of the Isaacson book. Like other books by Isaacson I have read over the years, this book is beautifully written, very well documented, honest in its criticism and praise of Jobs, and really compelling. The end is of course very sad, no matter how you may have felt about Jobs as a human being. He was both a creative genius and a very difficult person to be around not only in the work environment, but with his own family and friends, and at the end, even his doctors and nurses. As a bonus, Isaacson also provides an excellent, well-documented, and honest description of the culture of Silicon Valley and the history of the rise, the fall, and the rise again of Apple. Having worked in Silicon Valley, I was able to have a front row seat to amazingly rapid and fascinating technological advances. I worked with very intelligent, creative, decent, incredibly hard-working people who lived in simple ranch houses and drove nondescript cars. We were never bored. We worked long hours. Eventually we may have even been rewarded financially. But there was another culture in Silicon Valley. There were the personalities, Jobs among them, who landed on the cover of Wired or Fortune. They would be interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS. Personalities such as Ellison at Oracle, Jim Clark at Silicon Graphics and Netscape, and Scott McNealy at Sun Microsystems, had very strong, notoriously difficult and demanding personalities and super inflated egos. They accumulated vast wealth. They fought with their neighbors over the height of their backyard fences. They built expensive yachts and travelled in custom designed private airplanes. Yes, some of them, such as Hewlett and Packard, or Andrew Grove at Intel, have made significant investments in philanthropic activities. Of course, Bill Gates seems now to be more respected for his global philanthropic activities than for his contributions to Microsoft Jobs personality in particular was very inconsistent, as though he possessed some sort of split personality. He and his family lived in a basic middle class neighborhood in Palo Alto (north of Apple headquarters in Cupertino). They had no security presence in their lives, unlike many. Yet Jobs regularly drove down 101 (a notoriously dangerous freeway) at 100 mph in his Mercedes AMG (a $100,000 car he replaced annually) with no license plates and, once arriving at work, deliberately parked across two handicapped spaces while declining the ‚Äústatus‚Äù of his own personal CEO parking space. When pulled over for speeding or for driving without plates, he would make an excuse to the officer, speed off again, miracuously arriving safely at his destination. Jobs read the Autobiography of a Yogi once a year and spent time at Buddhist retreats. However, these pursuits did not give him any sense of tranquillity. He could be brutal, extremely hyper-critical with his employees, his suppliers, distributors and ad agencies. He was a genius in directing the creation of remarkable technologies (Apple II, Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad,)frequently copying the work of researchers as Xerox Parc however. He founded the wildly successful Pixar Animation Studios with its long run producing blockbuster animated films. But, he made terribly wrong decisions about his own health. He dressed simply but had bizarre eating habits, eating nothing but carrot juice for months, going on fasts, and adamantly declining food that would assist in building up his immune system during his lengthy illness. I found his treatment of doctors and nurses to be outrageous, but it was very honestly conveyed to Isaacson by Jobs‚Äô wife, Laurene Powell, certain close friends, and even doctors. Waiting for death to take him, Jobs could not resist complaining about the design of his oxygen mask. What would Freud have thought? What type of behavior is this?The chapters on the design of the iPod, the MAC, and the Apple stores were fascinating and also indicative of the very demanding and obsessive nature of Jobs personality. I do appreciate the simplicity of Apple's products, the Zen-like design of devices such as the Macbook Pro and the white iPhone. However I feel guilty possessing them knowing they were produced in China in horrible sweatshop factories, such as Foxcomm, where workers have even committed suicide after working very long hours for very low wages and feeling completely hopeless of ever rising above these conditions.The corporate history of Apple is also told is a very readable and well-documented detail. His dealings with others, including executives at suppliers and distributors, tech journalists, and powerful CEO‚Äôs such as Eisner at Disney, are fascinating and provide insights into the egos behind the CEO culture. Also compelling are the background stories behind the first firing of Jobs after his fall-out with former Pepsi CEO John Scully, his failures (such as the LISA computer and the Next computer) his return and attempt to run the highly successful PIXAR Studios at the same time as he was re-energizing Apple, the controversy surrounding back-dated stock options, the secrecy surrounding his health issues, and his final months. Jobs and his team created many highly successful products. But the failures were also given their fair share of treatment. What I‚Äôm left with most is a feeling of sadness for his family, his three daughters, his wife, his son, and his sister, Mona Simpson. As his wife, Laurene Powell, discussed at the end of the book (pages 543 ‚Äì 544), ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not extraordinary in every realm‚Äù. His family was neglected, especially his daughters, even as he must have realized he was going to have only a few short months left in this world. Laurene admits to Isaacson that Steve ‚Äúdid not have social graces, such as putting himself in other people‚Äôs shoes.‚Äù I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how emotionally drained Laurene especially must feel as she recovers from the ordeal of caring for her husband during this prolonged illness. After months in denial and avoiding treatment he finally accepted various medical treatments but also insisted upon trying bizarre so-called approaches that may have served to only make his condition worse. I wonder to what degree his angry, frenetic behavior, his anger, his constant need to always be in control of everything may have contributed to the development of the cancer that ultimately killed him. What was missing from the book was a deeper look at the manufacturing processes behind the iPad, iPhone and other Apple products. I don‚Äôt fault Isaacson for this. There simply could not have been time for him to thoroughly research the issues. These can be examined in another book on the subject. China has closed these factories, such as the notorious Foxcomm, to outside visitors. Before complaining about the high price of Apple and other tech products, we should all think of the low wage Chinese factory workers who are suffering serious damage to their health and well-being, even risking their lives, putting together the products we covet. Perhaps the new management at Apple will finally address these and other social welfare issues. Overall, Apple‚Äôs products have provided great benefit to so many around the globe. Do such products have to orginate with people possessing such difficult, abusive personalities?

‚ÄúIf you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you‚Äôve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, ‚ÄúBye. I have to go. I‚Äôm going crazy and I‚Äôm getting out of here.‚Äù And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently. (Steve Jobs)‚Äù

5.0 out of 5 starsIsaacson does it again, illustrating great genius with great writing.ByDick Macgurnon March 17, 2017I bought this book, not because it was about Jobs, but because I'm a big fan of Isaacson. This work, much like his other works, was unsurprisingly of the highest caliber, but what did surprise me was that the subject matter, Jobs, was much more intriguing than I could have imagined. I was an early Apple computer owner in the 70s which had a huge impact on my life and career as a computer programmer, but I was always a Wozniak fan, and never thought anything of whoever this Jobs person was. Oh how wrong I was, and I think that's a big part about why Isaacson agreed to do this biography. Jobs turns out to be the driving force behind so many huge and successful companies that he built including Apple, Mac, Pixar, iTunes, and others. Not to take anything away from the hardware genius of the Woz, but Jobs was the smartest and most talented of them all. Having not read this book yet, I took for granted nearly all of what he accomplished. What Isaacson has done more than anything, is make us understand how all of these great accomplishments came about despite so many difficulties and obstacles, and yet once he illustrates for us who Jobs really was, his incredible success seems inevitable. Isaacson brings to light the deep artistic passion of Jobs using equally artistic prose which makes the book hard to put down at any hour.

3.0 out of 5 starsVery interesting biography - not a great book.ByZachon December 9, 2014Let me explain...The stories about Steve Jobs are great.  I loved hearing the interviews from various people who's paths have crossed with Steve over his life.  There are definitely some unique perspectives and I definitely have a new perspective on a man that is pretty well known already.However, I do have to say the writing of the book was not my cup of tea.  Too often, the interested stories of Steve Jobs life were overshadowed by Isaacson's haphazard storytelling - at times it felt all over the place.  Now I understand a biography doesn't have to be chronological, and often, it makes sense to follow an interesting arc of one's life for some depth.  However, too often, i felt lost and confused.  One moment we are talking about Steve's fight with cancer.  This led to a comment about how Steve thought the stress from the 80's may have in some way caused/encouraged his cancer to develop.  All of a sudden, Isaacson transports us back to those days - despite the fact he's already thoroughly described that portion of Steve's life in an earlier chapter.Another minor annoyance with the audiobook version - there is no signal to change CD's.  I would be listening and suddenly I would be transported back 20 years only to realize I had re-listened to the first minute of the CD.  This was made even more difficult since, as mentioned above, Isaacson tended to do this (jump around) even in the normal course of the book so i was never sure if this was his writing style or the CD had restarted.Nevertheless, Steve Jobs will always be remembered as an important business leader at, as Isaacson seemed to reiterate every third paragraph or so, the intersection of technology and humanities.

What made him great?  I really loved this book, it was emotional, it made you feel that you knew the man, and it was not full of praise, but seemed to be a real look into his life.  Jobs is an interesting character.  He was full of himself, mean, selfish, and yes, a jerk.  But he accomplished some great things.  So what made him great.  One element of his greatness was his ability to lead forward.  He did not let critics or committee influence him negatively.  Sometimes when you are right, you need to be right.  This is a hard thing for people to deal with in the church, but there are times to stand your ground.  You need to lead courageously.  You also need to look for the little improvements.  The details are important, it is better to do something right, instead of just doing it.  Too often we look for progress, but we do not look for perfection in the church.  We settle for less too often.  There was a lot of negative lessons too that I learned.  He was mean to people, and this is a leadership style I always want to avoid, he also forgot about his family, and no success is worth that.  Also, never be prideful, he was wrong a lot of times too, but his ego got in the way.  This is a great book to read, and is interesting, helpful, and well done.  If you love Apple, success, and failure, it has it all.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing story of a complex manBya New Yorkeron July 31, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseWith the exception of one laptop and 2 non-smart cell phones, in my personal and professional life since 2004 I've had nothing but Apple products - computers (both desktop and laptop), iPads, iPods, and my crown jewel:  my iPhone.  None has ever disappointed me.  I say this not to put forth a review of the Apple products but to explain that I am part of Steve Jobs's choir:  I value, respect and rely on the products that he created.  I'm sold, so to speak. And so it seemed only logical that I would eventually read this book to gain insight both in the genesis and evolution of Apple and in the person of Steve Jobs.  The book did not disappoint in either.What I found out about the early years and the development of the personal computer was fascinating.  I do remember a lot of the news articles from those years - I was living in San Francisco at the time and a good friend of mine worked for Apple - but I would not consider myself previously knowledgeable about Apple in any comprehensive way.  I learned so much of the nuts and bolts of Apple Computer, Inc., from this book.  The chapters about the creation of the iPod, iPhone and iPad were very interesting to someone who has used these products for years and years and feels she has some proficiency using what they offer me.But the insight I gained from the book on Steve Jobs the man left me very sad.  While I consider him to have been a true genius with an almost other-worldly imagination, I can't imagine that I would have liked him very much or respected him outside of his professional arena.  As the founder and developer of Apple Computer, he was spectacular.  He had an intense imagination, vision, and belief in things that had yet to be discovered. He was fortunate enough to find those people who had the same precise work ethic that he did.  To find those people and to hone the abilities of the ones who stayed, he had no reservations about crushing their substandard efforts or their feelings.  The ones who lasted were the ones who believed in his vision and their Jobs-given opportunity to indulge and demonstrate their own creativity.  The ones who lasted were the best and brightest the tech and artistic world had to offer.  The ones who lasted were the ones who took his ideas and made them into our reality.  I am profoundly grateful to them and to him for the advances they made in technology and artistry.  And I guess the one cannot exist without the other.  Without his exact personality would the tech world have been turned on its ear and eventually controlled by Apple?  I don't know.  Actually I doubt it.In terms of his family, it seemed as if his attention to them was given only when it was not required or demanded elsewhere.  His children were discussed very little; the same is true about Laurene Powell, his wife.  But it is clear that in his wife he found the one person who was his equal in intelligence and commitment. Their marriage is portrayed as strong but him as absent.The sections on his cancer and eventual death were moving but not enough to make me feel for him as a person.  I am sorry he died but my sorrow has to do with the loss of him professionally and what he might have accomplished and achieved had he lived but not with the loss of him as a man.  And yet I can recognize his genius and I'm glad I read the book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsComplicated ManBypuzzle momon April 13, 2017Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI have read several articles about Steve Jobs over the years and I have been ambivalent on how I feel about him.  No doubt a genius but as a person-I honestly did not think I would like him.  I liked that Steve and his family and co-workers participated in this book.  I really like biographies but the ones people write about themselves always leave me wondering "what did they leave out".  I did not feel that way about this book although very little comes from his family.  Most of the story surrounds the building of Apple. Steve has a sister who is not interviewed and no reason is given for this,  I am assuming she did not want to participate.  However, I cannot imagine having him as a brother.  After reading this book I see he was driven in all areas of his life, work, love, perfection, and in others-such as always wearing the same types of clothes he could care less.  (Although be assured that those turtlenecks were probably the most expensive produced at that time.)  So did i like him at the end?  No,not really but it does seem he tried to reach out and make amends to people he hurt.  He seems proud of his family and wife  and I find myself admiring him more for being so open about his life.  He had an amazing life and I thank Mr. Isaacson for sharing it with us.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsWhy Isaacson?ByJames D. Williamson November 28, 2011Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseA good biography reads like a novel.  In addition, it delves deep to provide personal details that make the subject come alive in the mind of the reader.  Examples of good biographies readily come to mind:  McCoullough's biography of John Adams, Sheaffer's biography of Eugene O'Neill, the first volume of Morris' biography of Teddy Roosevelt, Dwyer's biography of Napoleon.Sadly, Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs reads more like a People Magazine article than a novel.  Part of the problem is that Isaacson apparently rushed his research owing to Jobs' ill health.  Consider that Sheaffer spent 16 years researching his two books on O'Neill; if memory serves, Morris spent about 10 years researching the first volume of his biography of Roosevelt and an equal amount of time researching the second volume.  The result is that Isaacson's portrait of Jobs is one-dimesional.  Isaacson's account of how Jobs met his wife consists of merely a few paragraphs, and his description of her is so pedestrian that she is hard to differentiate from Jobs' other romantic partners. Although Oracle founder Larry Ellison is described as Jobs' best friend, we learn nothing about how that friendship developed or what role it played in Jobs' life.  Isaacson writes that Jobs was "complex," but he fails to show that complexity.  Instead, we are offered repeated stock images of Jobs crying and being charming one moment and distant the next.  At no point does Isaacson offer any insight into Jobs' motivations or personality; instead, he takes the sophomoric shortcut and attributes everything to Jobs being adopted.  Equally problematic from my perspective, however, is that Isaacson just isn't a good writer.  The language is flat, dull, BORING, and fails to rise to the level even of a "good turn of phrase."  Given the influence Jobs had on so many facets of modern life, his story deserved better.11 comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsWriting as  artByLiteratureTeacheron August 21, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified Purchase"Steve Jobs" is biographical writing at its best. The author has crafted a compelling, frank portrait of a man who was very complex, brilliant, and at times, not very nice. Regardless of how the reader feels about Jobs and Apple, this biography is a true pleasure to read. I immersed myself in both the audiobook and the (Kindle) book for more than two months. I savored every page because I am fascinated by how  a genius creates a work of art--specifically how Isaacson wove together the multitude of interviews, his research, and Jobs's contributions. Sentence by sentence, Isaacson reveals his subject not all at once, but in stages making it seem as if the reader is becoming Jobs as Jobs becomes Jobs as he encounters his successes and struggles.In a literary world populated with biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs, "Steve Jobs" stands out, for me, as one of the four within this genre that are truly artistic.  The other three are "Unbroken", "American Prometheus", and "Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl".  These three biographies and one autobiography are carefully crafted verbal portraits of individuals who were truly remarkable.  In each case, the authors create an ambiance that pulls in readers and compels them to take the journey with the subject as well as with the author. These authors clearly loved and admired their subjects, and that is evident in the care that they took to craft their books.Of course, it is rare that biographers get to interact with their subjects, and some readers may suspect that the authors become biased either towards or against their subject. The consequences being sugarcoating or exaggerating faults and foibles. Not so with Isaacson. He shows us Jobs as he was--the good and the not-so-good. He remains neutral and presents Jobs as Jobs represented himself, and as his family and colleagues perceived him. In conclusion, "Steve Jobs" flourishes because of this attentive integration of perspectives and analysis of an American icon. "Steve Jobs" the biography deserves a place in the American literary canon as an example of literary art.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA Passion for the Perfect ProductByDoctor Mosson November 26, 2011Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThere was a lot to Steve Jobs, despite his penchant for minimalism.  But what stands out the most to me from Isaacon's biography is Jobs' passion for making great products -- his uncompromising obsession with making everything that he touched as perfect as it could be.  That's what Jobs' legacy is for the great majority of us who didn't work with or live close to him -- he not only gave us incredible, ground-breaking products, but a model of personal passion to produce the thing that is perfect.Isaacson presents more than that one side of Jobs.  There is also Jobs the interpersonal disaster, the narcissist seemingly utterly lacking the capacity for empathy.  As Isaacson says and cites others saying, Jobs seems to actually need to tear down other people now and then, and shows little regret afterwards.  This often-public destruction of another human being can be rationalized as the need to push people to extreme accomplishments, or to separate "B players" from "A players", but it is all too-often abused as an excuse for simply being a jerk.Another side that Isaacson reveals is Jobs as complex husband and father.  Given how difficult his relationships with people in general were, it's not hard to imagine that his romantic relationships were difficult as well, or that he struggled as a parent, particularly with his daughters.  His initial denial of his first child, by his girlfriend at the time, is appalling but really not so surprising, given all that we learn about his apparent drive to unfettered self-indulgence.But all of that, as reprehensible as it is, pales in comparison to what I took away from Isaacson's book about Jobs the designer.The "product" is more than the thing, for Jobs.  It begins with the advertising, the shopping experience at the Apple store, the paying experience, the packaging, then the thing itself, how you use it, how you use it with other products, the support experience, even how you eventually replace the product with something new -- Jobs wanted every bit of it to be perfect. Hence the closed system that Apple both suffers and thrives from.  In an almost measured, wise moment, Jobs grants to Bill Gates that each pursued a profitable course, one controlling the product and the other freely licensing it for wide adoption and multiple sources of innovation.  Of course, when he comes back to himself, Jobs believes and says that what Microsoft produced, by allowing any and all to play in an uncoordinated manner, was "crap."  Openness sounds good and plays well in the technology culture, but Jobs' particular path to perfection demanded and thrived on control.What's odd is that, as a person of so little empathy, Jobs could be such a great, almost unerring, judge of what people would love in a product.  After all, "perfection" here is hardly an objective standard -- it's Jobs' own judgment.  He was wrong now and then -- the G4 Cube or that hockey puck mouse that came with the original iMac -- but his batting average was awfully good.  Isaacson provides a jaw-dropping list, from the Apple II and the Mac, through Toy Story, iTunes, the iPhone and iPod, the iPad, the Apple retail stores, and right up to iCloud.  And he did it all while disdaining customer focus groups or even customer testing.  "Our job," he said, "is to figure out what they're going to want before they do."Jobs' passion went beyond the product, too, to the company itself.  It's clear, especially later in his life, that Apple was not just a vehicle for him, that he wanted to create a great company that would continue well beyond his leadership, to go on to create great, innovative products, with that same no-compromise approach.  He may not have been a great teacher or mentor, and we'll see how that part of his legacy turns out, but the intention to create a great company that outlived him was certainly there.Jobs has sometimes been derided as simply a skilled marketer (by distinction from Steve Wozniak's technical brilliance), even as a con man, manipulating whole crowds by creating  "reality distortion fields" around him.  But I think Jobs was sincere. Even when he shilled his products, proclaiming them "the greatest thing we've done", he meant it.  Why not?  He had made sure it was great, he wouldn't stop until it was.  When he told the Cupertino City Council, while showing the drawings for Apple's proposed new headquarters, "It's like a spaceship has landed," he wasn't so much hyping as he was showing his own genuine delight with what he and his architects were creating.  That delight was the payoff for his perfectionism.Isaacson's book won't be the only biography of Jobs.  I'd be interested to read, for example, a study of Jobs as designer (or of Apple's design history under his leadership, finally giving due respect to the contributions of not only Jony Ive but the many others who contributed).  But Isaacson's is certainly a good starting point, a kind of opening to the conversation that others can now take up and hopefully will.0Comment|

I may not have liked the main character all the time but never did I not want to learn everything about Steve Jobs. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Isaacson had a major feat of writing about a complicated personality who lived more in his one life than three or four accomplished individuals put together. Thank goodness I saw the movie and decided to read the book. The movie is crap and does not do justice to his legacy. The book must be good because I like him less now than before I read about him!

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThis is a book about exceptionalismByASon May 14, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is a book about dogged perseverance. It is not that Jobs had a great model, it was that he did not relent till he got it right.  He would have made great products on open platforms - just as he with closed - if only that's what he had believe in.  The book is exceptional.  It tells a story but in a way that leads to insights. Great life. Great story. Told brilliantly.0Comment|

Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography book of Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and TIME who has written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.[1][2]
Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîin addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîIsaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life.[3] Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published.[4]
The book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.[5]
A film adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, with Michael Fassbender starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.

Appearance[edit]




The book's cover photograph is similar to one taken previously by Norman Seeff and featured on Rolling Stone.[6]


Front cover[edit]
The front cover uses a photographic portrait of Steve Jobs commissioned by Fortune magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.
When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4√ó5 camera before saying, "wow, you're shooting film."[7]

If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.
‚Äî‚ÄâAlbert Watson[7]

Jobs gave Watson an hour‚Äîlonger than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.[7]
The title font is Helvetica.[8]
Back cover[edit]
The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by TIME magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.[9]

We did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses‚Äîhe lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder‚Äîand I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here‚Äîthis was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.
‚Äî‚ÄâNorman Seeff[9]





The placeholder cover used for the book uses the working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs.


Title[edit]
The book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant."[10]
The title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.[11]
Chapters[edit]
Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.

Film adaptation[edit]
Main article: Steve Jobs (film)
Steve Jobs is a drama film based on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).
Other media[edit]
Extracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.[12]
To memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.[13] The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.[14]
Bloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.
Fortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the "friend-enemy" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]
Even after a late release that year, the book became Amazon's #1 seller for 2011.[16]

2012 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award, shortlist[17]
2011 The New York Times bestseller

Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography book of Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and TIME who has written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.[1][2]
Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîin addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîIsaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life.[3] Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published.[4]
The book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.[5]
A film adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, with Michael Fassbender starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.

Appearance[edit]




The book's cover photograph is similar to one taken previously by Norman Seeff and featured on Rolling Stone.[6]


Front cover[edit]
The front cover uses a photographic portrait of Steve Jobs commissioned by Fortune magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.
When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4√ó5 camera before saying, "wow, you're shooting film."[7]

If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.
‚Äî‚ÄâAlbert Watson[7]

Jobs gave Watson an hour‚Äîlonger than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.[7]
The title font is Helvetica.[8]
Back cover[edit]
The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by TIME magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.[9]

We did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses‚Äîhe lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder‚Äîand I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here‚Äîthis was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.
‚Äî‚ÄâNorman Seeff[9]





The placeholder cover used for the book uses the working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs.


Title[edit]
The book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant."[10]
The title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.[11]
Chapters[edit]
Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.

The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).
Other media[edit]
Extracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.[12]
To memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.[13] The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.[14]
Bloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.
Fortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the "friend-enemy" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]
Even after a late release that year, the book became Amazon's #1 seller for 2011.[16]

2011 The New York Times bestseller

Publisher's Summary

La biograf√≠a definitiva de Steve Jobs, el fundador de Apple, escrita con su colaboraci√≥n.Tras m√°s de cuarenta entrevistas con Steve Jobs y con un centenar de personas de su entorno, familiares, amigos, adversarios y colegas, esta es la biograf√≠a definitiva de uno de los iconos indiscutibles de nuestro tiempo, del genio cuya creatividad, energ√≠a y perfeccionismo revolucionaron seis industrias: inform√°tica, pel√≠culas de animaci√≥n, m√∫sica, tel√©fonos, tabletas y edici√≥n digital. Cuando el mundo buscaba c√≥mo construir las bases de una econom√≠a digital, Jobs fue un s√≠mbolo de la inventiva. Consciente de que la mejor manera de crear valor en el siglo XXI era conectar la creatividad con la tecnolog√≠a, fund√≥ una empresa en la que impresionantes saltos de la imaginaci√≥n iban de la mano con asombrosos logros tecnol√≥gicos.Aunque Jobs colabor√≥ con el libro, no pidi√≥ ning√∫n control sobre el contenido, ni siquiera el derecho a leerlo antes de la publicaci√≥n. No rehuy√≥ ning√∫n tema y anim√≥ a la gente que conoc√≠a a hablar con franqueza. ¬´He hecho muchas cosas de las que no me siento orgulloso, como dejar a mi novia embarazada a los 23 a√±os y c√≥mo me comport√© entonces, pero no hay ning√∫n cad√°ver en mi armario que no pueda salir a la luz¬ª.Jobs habla con sinceridad, a veces brutal, sobre la gente con la que ha trabajado y contra la que ha competido. De igual modo, sus amigos, rivales y colegas ofrecen una visi√≥n sin edulcorar de las pasiones, los demonios, el perfeccionismo, los deseos, el talento, los trucos y la obsesi√≥n por controlarlo todo que modelan su visi√≥n empresarial y los innovadores productos que logr√≥ crear.Jobs pod√≠a desesperar a quienes le rodeaban. Pero su personalidad y sus productos han estado siempre interrelacionados, igual que el hardware y el software de Apple. Su historia, por tanto, est√° llena de lecciones sobre innovaci√≥n, car√°cter, liderazgo y valores. La historia de un genio capaz de enfurecer y seducir a partes iguales.Please note: This audiobook is in Spanish.

"Biografia escrita como novela hist√≥rica.Muy buena!"



El autor presenta la biografia de un genio como Jobs casi como novela, pero con la profundidad y seriedad de un texto de historia. El personaje se presenta sobre todo como un ser humano, un americano de su tiempo, un artista y un visionario, con toda la carga  emocional de un adoptado, casi un desadaptado, y su peso y efectos psicol√≥gicos .  La descripcion del proceso  tecnol√≥gico es fascinante.Creo que si Steve Jobs habr√≠a podido leerlo, le hubiera encantado. Muy buen libro

"Adictivo, revelador."



fascinante del principio al final, con una narrativa tan rica y abundante que pod√≠a inmiscuirme en cada momento y visualizarlo. Ahora que lo he terminado siento el vac√≠o y quisiera que Steve Jobs estuviese vivo para seguir escribiendo p√°ginas de su vida, esa vida que ha cambiado el mundo.

"El mister universo en tecnolog√≠a!"



Would you listen to Steve Jobs. La Biograf√≠a again? Why?
No toda, por lo larga que es, pero si los Bookmarks que he marcado

Who was your favorite character and why?
Steve!  Por obvias razones<br/>Todo el libro es sobre el...

What does Roberto Medina bring to the story that you wouldn‚Äôt experience if you just read the book?
El juego de voces que realiz√≥ es muy bueno y el ritmo de la lectura y entusiasmo tambi√©n

Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?
DefinitivamenteSi no estas ocupado naciendo (creando) estas ocupado... muriendo (B. Dylan)

Any additional comments?
Un audiolibro excelente para escuchar que muestra la vida de un genio bueno y malo a la vez, cuya pasi√≥n y amor por lo que hac√≠a lo despeg√≥ del mont√≥n y dej√≥ un legado en tecnolog√≠a como referente mundial

"El personaje m√°s influyente del Siglo XXI en la cultura Pop"



Si enumeramos la cantidad de industrias transformadas por Steve Jobs por medio de Apple, nos daremos cuenta que su influencia  representa el d√≠a de hoy un legado que est√° presente la mayor√≠a de las personas de la cultura Occidental. Fue la tecnolog√≠a el veh√≠culo con el cual Jobs logr√≥ la trascendencia y su pasi√≥n por el Arte y la ciencia lo que lo llevo a crear Apple.

Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography book of Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and TIME who has written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.[1][2]
Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years‚Äîin addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues‚ÄîIsaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life.[3] Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the right to read it before it was published.[4]
The book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.[5]
A film adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, with Michael Fassbender starring in the title role, was released on October 9, 2015.

Appearance[edit]




The book's cover photograph is similar to one taken previously by Norman Seeff and featured on Rolling Stone.[6]


Front cover[edit]
The front cover uses a photographic portrait of Steve Jobs commissioned by Fortune magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.
When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4√ó5 camera before saying, "wow, you're shooting film."[7]

If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.
‚Äî‚ÄâAlbert Watson[7]

Jobs gave Watson an hour‚Äîlonger than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.[7]
The title font is Helvetica.[8]
Back cover[edit]
The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by TIME magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.[9]

We did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses‚Äîhe lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder‚Äîand I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here‚Äîthis was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.
‚Äî‚ÄâNorman Seeff[9]





The placeholder cover used for the book uses the working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs.


Title[edit]
The book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant."[10]
The title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.[11]
Chapters[edit]
Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.

Film adaptation[edit]
Main article: Steve Jobs (film)
Steve Jobs is a drama film based on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).
Other media[edit]
Extracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.[12]
To memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.[13] The issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.[14]
Bloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.
Fortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the "friend-enemy" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]
Even after a late release that year, the book became Amazon's #1 seller for 2011.[16]

2012 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award, shortlist[17]
2011 The New York Times bestseller

Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie. He didn't much like to shower or wear shoes. He believed his diet kept him from getting stinky, not true apparently. In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange.

Steve Jobs was a damn dirty hippie. He didn't much like to shower or wear shoes. He believed his diet kept him from getting stinky, not true apparently. In fact he was quite odd and obsessive about his diets, he would go on kicks where he would eat nothing but carrots for long periods of time until he turned orange. This makes me wonder if these strange eating habits brought on his cancer. Who can say?Steve Jobs was an asshat.He was an ass to everyone, even Steve Wozniak, who by everyone's standards is one of the nicest guys there is. Wozniak was Job's only friend at times, and looked up to him always, but Jobs screwed him over time and again. Jobs didn't even claim his first born daughter (until much later) as his own even though there was no doubt she belonged to him. He also was a very emotional man, lots of crying and snot when he wanted something. Impossible to please, even down to the color of things. I seriously don't know how anything got finished, I really don't.Steve Jobs was a super genius.Despite of (or because of) all this he created the most amazing things. Because he demanded the impossible, he would get it. I love my Ipod and my Ipad. I'm very attached, I don't want to live without them. I use the Ipod for my audiobook and podcast addiction. I'm even learning how to draw caricatures on the Ipad.....so frik'n cool. Thank you Steve for being a damn dirty hippie, asshat super genius. Your creations have enhanced, and changed our lives.Review also appears on Shelfinflicted....Go and visit!

There are three things necessary for a great biography:1. A compelling subject2. An engaging narrative3. AccuracyWalter Isaacson's Steve Jobs has all three.Steve Jobs was a fascinating person whose powerful personality and extraordinary life make for a very compelling read. He revolutionized many different technological and entertainment industries by successfully blending technology and the liberal arts, giving consumers products they didn't even know they wanted. He was able to defy reality by simply refusing to accept it (a phenomenon referred to as his "reality distortion field"), enabling him to do the impossible. On a personal level, Jobs was a very sensitive and emotional man, yet he was unable to empathize with the feelings of others, which, along with his "reality distortion field," led to him act in unsavory ways towards people in both his personal and professional life. After reading this book it was easy to understand why Jobs is such a polarizing figure. But whether you love or hate him, it's impossible to deny that he had a major impact on the world, or that he was an interesting person.Isaacson's narrative style is engaging. Rather than listing a bunch of facts and quotes, which would make for a very dull read, he uses them to construct a story about Jobs' life. The book is also structured in a logical fashion. Although largely chronological, the chapters do center around certain themes. Isaacson also avoids getting bogged down by technological details, which can be a temptation in a book that features a computer company. Even when the technological aspects of a product are necessary to illustrate a point, they are explained simply so that even a reader who is not tech savvy can understand.In terms of accuracy, I can only judge based on what I know from other sources as well as my impression after reading the biography. I do not have the resources or connections to go through every assertion made and verify them. I can, however, assess whether or not Isaacson appeared to be presenting an overly positive or negative picture. I believe that Isaacson presents a realistic picture of Jobs that includes both the positive and negative sides to his personality. Jobs comes across as a real person with a lot of flaws and perhaps a mental illness, but who has also accomplished some amazing things. I did not get the feeling that Isaacson was trying to whitewash or defame him. This is not to say that Isaacson is unbiased, but I have yet to find a biographer who isn't. A biographer must be passionate about his or her subject in order to devote the time needed to write a thorough biography, and with passion comes bias, whether positive or negative. Isaacson was positively biased towards Jobs, however, this did not prevent him from exposing the darker side of Jobs' personality. He also contradicts Jobs' own statements with both facts and other people's accounts. I appreciated that he included both sides of a story. However, he does tend to justify Jobs' obnoxious behavior and negative personality traits by reminding the reader that these behaviors and traits also led him to do great things, and achieve the impossible. It often seems as though Isaacson is implying that the ends justify the means, although the reader is able to form his or her own opinion. If you can ignore Isaacson's apologetic tone, which is present throughout, the biography does present a balanced picture of Jobs.Overall, I really enjoyed this biography. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Steve Jobs, Apple, or is interested in particularly influential people. Although Pixar plays a much smaller role, there are also some interesting stories about how Pixar came to be what it is today. I would not recommend this biography to Apple haters or Steve Jobs haters due to Isaacson's apologetic presentation of Jobs' negative traits, nor would I recommend it to fans who would rather remember an idealized version of Jobs. Also, I'd caution readers to remember that this is a biography about Steve Jobs, not about the history of Apple. While Apple is featured in this biography quite a bit since it was a huge part of Jobs' life, more so than his other companies or even his family, there are pieces of Apple's story that are missing or glossed over, presumably because in the grand scheme of Jobs' life, they were not that important. If you are looking for a complete profile of Apple, this is not it, although it will give you some interesting insights into the company, and provide a detailed, though incomplete, history.Disclaimer: I think it's important to note my personal history with Apple. I have been drinking the Apple koolaid for about twenty years, which is most of my life. In high school, I used to get into debates with people over whether Macs or PCs were better, often being the only Mac defender in a group arguing for PCs. Like any Apple fanatic, I've regarded Steve Jobs with a sort of reverence usually reserved for rock stars and actors. I was, therefore, deeply interested in reading about his life. Take what you will from my review given my feelings towards Apple, and the man who made the company what it is today.

Update This is a very interesting view of Steve Jobs by the mother of his daughter, Lisa (although he denied he was her father, despite paternity tests) and his childhood sweetheart. She doesn't think the film goes far enough in depicting his character truthfully. I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true. Apple's lawyers would sue her out of all existence if there was even a word that they could latch onto. But still
Update This is a very interesting view of Steve Jobs by the mother of his daughter, Lisa (although he denied he was her father, despite paternity tests) and his childhood sweetheart. She doesn't think the film goes far enough in depicting his character truthfully. I am sure that what she writes in her book The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs is absolutely true. Apple's lawyers would sue her out of all existence if there was even a word that they could latch onto. But still, her feelings and opinions are her own.____________This is a fantastically well-written and exhaustive biography of a brilliant, if flawed, man, with no holds barred. Jobs great achievement was to marry an uncompromisingly zen creativity to electronically-advanced products when all around built boxes. The art of form following function taken to its extreme, where even the innards are as beautiful as the case, has an authenticity that appeals to all (even those who won't pay for an Apple product).They say that when you are dying you regret not what you did but what you didn't do. Jobs scarcely regretted a thing, his ego was so vast he could hardly contemplate that he might actually have been wrong and since a young age, he only ever did what he wanted and could not be swayed or persuaded by anyone else to even do something as small as hold his acerbic tongue. I was once an electronics designer. I made quite a lot of money and essentially retired at 25. Sir Alan Sugar, the originator of The Apprentice and a friend and business acquaintance asked me to come to work for him as his personal assistant. I didn't, I decided to sail around the world instead. More fool me. The book made me wish, and not for the first time and not because I am now quite poor (all booksellers are, except the Amazon crew) that I hadn't left electronics, because my head is again full of ideas and that is where they will have to stay. So I have regrets even now.I took the road less travelled and it turned out to end up in a tropical mangrove swamp where I sit, pleasantly bogged down. Jobs took the highway, the one with a good surface and plenty of signs. He overtook everyone and reached his destination of unqualified success, excellence, money and credibility in a very short time, and the world would be a lot poorer without him. RIP Steve. You were a true artist and visionary.I haven't got a Mac myself. Because, as the advert said, I'm just not cool enough....Edit May 2014. I went to dinner on a 93' yacht with a chef, hostess and a couple of crew and the captain gave me an iPad for a present. He said it was only a first gen. one and I was too cool not to have a Mac :-) This is true ;-). I did't see the captain for about three or four months. We were in the same marina bar. He asked me how I liked the ipad and I said great and went to get it out of my bag. It was gone. Someone had stolen it from my bag within the last ten minutes (I'd only been there that long). But who... in a crowd how can you tell? I have a really cheap under $100 Chinese tablet now. It does everything that the ipad did but it isn't thin and cool. But then neither am I.Finished March 1, 2012

When I was at the halfway point I became struck by what a jerk SJ was. Yes, he was brilliant and all that. But he seemed to view other humans as nothing more than ants in his ant farm, sub-biologicals that he could squish whenever he felt like it. And did.Some might say that his gifts to tech development, or the fact that he changed and invented whole industries, would compensate. Maybe the two things went together, cruelty and brilliance. But the lesson to be drawn here, future CEOs, isn't that his cruelty fed his brilliance. He was brilliant, and he was cruel, and they weren't linked. He was aware of the pain he was causing other people, yet like so many other overbearing, thoughtless and petulant overlords, Jobs was thin-skinned. Also, I don't believe that his often-cited sense of abandonment, from having been put up for adoption, justifies his behavior.He was, as the author put it, "bratty." Jobs would fiddle with design changes to the point of driving his team mad. A thousand different variations of white weren't satisfactory. He wanted a new color to be invented, regardless of the damage done to the rollout of the new object. As I said, I'm only halfway through the book. Hopefully there'll be some positive info about SJ that will balance out some of the negativity I've spelled out. I'll finish this review when I finish the book.Nov. 8, 2011: I finished the book. Here are the rest of my thoughts.Isaacson makes an interesting point when he says Jobs was a genius. He means genius not in terms of a high IQ, but in terms of an ability to see things in surges of intuition, inspiration, and creativity. (BTW here's an interesting rundown of the smartest people on the planet: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-sm...) Because of his genius, I agree that Jobs deserves to be included in the company of Edison, Franklin, et al. Steve Jobs pushed everybody until they wanted to kill him, but the pushing yielded amazing, brilliant new products. His unique brainpower allowed him to see how things might align, merge, and serve each other, and how utility might be blended with art. That vision led to creations of whole industries. His obsession with perfection and control led him to flirt with emulating the Big Brother that Apple was created to bring down. One of the fascinating threads of this book was the debate between proponents of closed and open systems. Was it better to manufacture a pristine, inflexible system or the messier free thinking open system? And what were the implications of that belief on Jobs' view of his customers and his worldview?Yet he defined petulance. His food had to be just so. He would send back a glass of orange juice three times until finally satisfied it was fresh. He was vindictive, cruel and even Machiavellian. He wasn't much of a family man, and he ignored his kids to a painful extent. Isaacson mused that Jobs' meanness wasn't a critical part of his success. He was totally aware of its effect on others, yet he indulged.In spite of my aversion to the man, I actually felt empowered as I came to the end of the book. Steve Jobs had lived by certain precepts, which in the current economy we could all benefit from:---Know your value ---Have a skill you can sell. Be really, really good at something.---Things can turn around if you persevere, but don't be afraid to walk away.Unbending to the end, even the prospect of death didn't soften him up much, but he brought me up short on the last page of the book, because I am obsessed with the same question:"I like to think that something survives after you die. It's strange to think that you accumulate all this experience, and maybe a little wisdom, and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, and that maybe your consciousness endures." I closed the book with a bit more compassion for this difficult man and went outside to pick cilantro for that night's dinner. Since we'd just had a serious storm, I declined to rinse it. I simply cleaned it, thinking, ‚ÄúOrganic and pristine from the garden. Steve would‚Äôve approved.‚Äù

so, we are having the event for this book at our store tonight. the number of people calling up to ask if steve jobs will also be present to sign is staggering. in other words, "i care enough about steve jobs to want to read a 600+ page book about him, but i am somehow unaware that he is deceased."is what i hope. the alternative is ghoulish and i do not want to entertain it.

For those who are too busy to read the entire book, please try to grab a quick read of the last two chapters of the book at a book store or airport or someplace - These chapters are a concise summary of the entire book as well as the thesis Isaacson builds up to throughout the book. Besides, it will probably make you buy and read the whole thing anyway.To call this man a "Great Marketer" is probably a great disservice to him and Steve would probably have had a fit about that. I used to think of him as an epitome of modern marketing as well, but he would probably classify marketing as 'evil' in his radar. He hated the idea of any company focusing on marketing and emphatically states that is the whole problem with most companies today. This is probably a difficult idea to get to grips with, but is essential too.I hope every Management Guru and CEO is studying this book and drawing the right lessons. We could truly be in a better world if they do. Just to clarify, I am not a fanboy of all apple products though I am sure the Mac is the best tech device till date but I do I fall on the android side of the fence. But, Jobs' philosophy on running companies and driving innovation is the best in the modern age and should be copied shamelessly, if not their product features (I am looking at you Samsung).

I'd really like to know more about his family dynamic. What was his parents' parenting style? The book says NOTHING about the adopted sister he grew up with. Anyone who has grown up with siblings can attest to the influence of siblings on their personality. To me the lack of insight into his teen and pre-teen life leaves a glaring hole in understanding the man.My opinion of Steve Jobs: The ends don't justify the means. I don't care how creative or driven you are; you're not allowed to be an asshole to your fellow human beings.

Executive summary of Isaacson's "Steve Jobs":- Remove everything that is unnecessary.- Be ruthless about building an A team.- Make stuff you believe in.- Collaborate often through vigorous discussion.- Push yourself and others to do the impossible now.- Make great experiences by simplifying.- Own your work and protect it.- Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.But these are not spoilers.

Executive summary of Isaacson's "Steve Jobs":- Remove everything that is unnecessary.- Be ruthless about building an A team.- Make stuff you believe in.- Collaborate often through vigorous discussion.- Push yourself and others to do the impossible now.- Make great experiences by simplifying.- Own your work and protect it.- Live at intersection of intellect and intuition.But these are not spoilers. The drama of this biography is in the decisions Jobs' made, the way he followed through on these ideals. Read the book. In the same way that you understand a proverb much more after you've had a life a experience that demonstrates it, these will mean much, much more when you see them in the context of Steve Jobs' life.Plus, you'll also discover Jobs' equally as compelling character traits: from his idealism to his irascibility.

This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful.

This is an amazing inside view into the life of one of the great businessmen of our era. A must read. The thing that struck me most about Steve Jobs was that he was an incredible perfectionist. He was a craftsman, and wanted the computers he built to be beautiful and amazing and useful. He believed that computers were "at the intersection of technology and liberal arts" - a phrase he used a lot - because he realized computers weren't just for geeks. They are for everyone, and needed to be able to be used by everyone.Steve put design at the top of product pyramid at Apple - above engineering. This means they spent a lot of time trying to fit the hardware into the beautifully designed cases the designers came up with, and the designers and engineers had to work together closely. This can backfire (eg Antennagate), but largely it worked really well. It produced amazing computers that were visually distinct from everything else in the market, and that "just work". If I learned anything from this book, it's that Apple believed that design is paramount, and spending extra time and engineering resources to make a beautiful design work is worth it.Apple's design philosophy is to "make it simple. Really simple". You still see this today - go to Apple.com - you will see ONE product. Now try Amazon. According to the book, Jobs learned this from Markkula, who taught him that "A great company must be able to impute its values from the first impression it makes". Steve's ethos was basically that if you are going to do something, do it right. The book is full of examples of Steve doing this. When the iMac first came out it looked like no other computer. It was interesting to hear how difficult it was for the engineers to accommodate a handle on the computer - but it ended up being a defining feature of the computer. I also loved the story of how Steve was obsessed with quality glass, and ordered the highest end stuff he could find for his Apple Stores.Steve's management tactics got a lot of scrutiny in the book - and many other reviewers use words like "jerk" to describe him. It sounds like Steve could definitely be a jerk to work for. His management style was to push people as hard as he could, and to let people know when they didn't perform. When pushed like that, a person can have one of two reactions: they either resent it, and end up quitting or getting fired (B-players) - or they accept the challenge to do better, and come back the next week with something even better. Win-win for Steve - he filters out the b-players and gets his a-players to produce the best work they can. But, as was pointed out in the book, if Steve was nothing but a jerk, he wouldn't have built a company full of loyal employees - Apple has one of the lowest turnover rates in the valley. Jobs only hired people who "had a passion for the product". I also liked how he motivated by looking at the bigger picture; such as the story of how he convinced his engineer that saving 10 seconds off the boot time was worth it because across 5 million users that would save 100 lifetimes per year.The book was full of references to Steve's dynamic personality; his "reality distortion field" is a great descriptor. Steve believed he could do anything - and he was so persuasive that he could convince those around him that they could whatever it was too. I think this is one of the most defining qualities of an entrepreneur - believing something can be done against all odds. Not being afraid to tear down walls or think outside the box. I loved the description of Steve that "whatever he was touting was the best thing he ever produced." You see him do this in his keynote speeches too. He is always using words like "best", "amazing", etc to describe whatever he's launching. A big theme that the author made was that especially early on, Steve viewed Apple as "counter-culture" rebels. They were hippies who thought they could change the world. And they did - but not only that - I think they embedded their can-do attitude deep in Silicon Valley, which is probably highly correlated with why it is the center of the technology revolution today. This quote is classic:
"The people who invited the twenty-first century were pot-smoking, sandal-wearing hippies from the West Coast like Steve, because they saw differently. The hierarchical systems of the East Coast, England, Germany, and Japan do not encourage this different thinking. The sixties produced an anarchic mind-set that is great for imagining a world not yet in existence."
One of Steve's great abilities was to focus. When Jobs came back to Apple from his hiatus the biggest innovation he made was to focus the company onto just the few products that were working or had potential. 
"What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they‚Äôre dragging you down. They‚Äôre turning you into Microsoft. They‚Äôre causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great."
Steve's belief that computers need to be beautiful and easy to use basically prevented him from ever licensing his software, as then he wouldn't be able to control the user experience. Microsoft didn't have that problem, and that's why Windows dominated. I think it's also the reason that Windows is in trouble today. They have spent a decade making their code work across hundreds of different hardware configurations. Their code is now full of backwards compatibility support that just makes it messy, and bloated. Worse, their focus is on maintaining all that instead of innovating and improving it. The platform vs integrated approach is being tested again with the iphone vs android. It will be interesting to see if history replays itself, or if Apple's lead and ability to make a superior product because of their full stack control will prevail.In the end, this was the best quote of the book:
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it.Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography. Isaacson declined several times, thinking that it was too soon to write one and that it would be better to wait a few decades.

I had to be convinced by a GR friend to read this book, similarly to how Isaacson had to be convinced to write it.Back in 2004, Steve Jobs approached Isaacson and asked if he was interested in writing Jobs' biography. Isaacson declined several times, thinking that it was too soon to write one and that it would be better to wait a few decades. It wasn't until 2009 when Jobs' wife bluntly told him that Jobs was seriously ill from cancer and that there was little time to lose. Isaacson said he hadn't known Jobs was sick; she said few people knew and that Jobs had been trying to keep it a secret.Isaacson finally agreed to write the biography, and Jobs agreed that he wouldn't have any control over the book, which was rare, considering how controlling and demanding he had been over all the various projects at Apple.I had been reluctant to read this book for several reasons. First, because Jobs was a known jackass and I wasn't that interested in reading the various examples of his jackassery. Second, I am not a techie, and while I like and use Apple products every day, I was hesitant to spend my precious reading time on a tech book. Thirdly, this bio is more than 600 pages long! That seemed excessive.A solution was found in an audiobook (read by Dylan Baker), and I am glad I gave it a chance. I was won over early on in the book, when Isaacson included a quote from Jobs in the introduction:"'I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,' he said. 'Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.' It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century."Now THAT is a theme I can get behind. I love the idea of combining artistry and technology, and it's true that Jobs and Apple excelled at creating innovative and beautiful products. Despite my hesitation, I ended up enjoying the stories of how Jobs got his start in computers, and how he met and started collaborating with Steve Wozniak, and the evolution of products at Apple over the decades. Growing up in the 80s, I frequently used those early Apple computers. My friends and I played games on them, and I wrote my school reports on them. Apple computers were just so cool. I liked learning the details of how Jobs helped design the products, including his emphasis that even the parts that are not seen should be beautiful and well-built. He had learned this at a young age from his father, who was a mechanic and a craftsman, and he taught Steve to make sure that the back of something was crafted just as well as the front, even if no one saw it. Jobs took the spirit of artistry very seriously, and always insisted that the designers at Apple were making art with their products. He even had his design team sign the inside of the computer frames, just as a painter would, even though no one but them knew it was there.Another part of the book that I found interesting was Jobs' history with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with whom he had a fiercely competitive but (mostly) respectful relationship. The two men had very different ideas about system design, and computer techies will probably enjoy the debate of open vs. closed systems. A lot has been written about what a jerk Jobs could be, including telling people to their face that they sucked, that their designs sucked, and that they should be fired for their suckitude. It is also true that he was a dirty hippie, and in the early days of Apple, colleagues had to beg him to take a shower. (Jobs thought that because he was a vegetarian, he didn't need to bathe.) At certain points, I was infuriated with Jobs, both over his treatment of others and later, over his refusal to deal with his cancer diagnosis. When he first learned he was ill, he defied his doctor's advice and delayed having surgery to remove the tumors, giving them months to spread. While impossible to prove, it is likely he could have greatly extended his life had he not been so stubborn in avoiding modern medicine.In the end, I admit I was fascinated by Steve Jobs. He had a remarkable life and career, and while it is a cliche, his products helped change the world. I would highly recommend this biography.Update April 2016Last night I watched the "Steve Jobs" movie that is based on this book (starring Michael Fassbender), and I have to give a shout-out to screenwriter Aaron Sorkin for creating such a compelling film out of this sprawling biography. I was happy I had read this book before watching the movie, because I understood more of the context of the arguments between Woz and Jobs, and Jobs and his ex-girlfriend, and Jobs and everyone else. I highly recommend the film.

Isaacson's writing style is very engaging and, at least so far, he seems to be embarking on a no holds barred, honest portrayal of this very admired, feared, respected, despised, controversial titan of industry. As a college senior in '85, watching the iconic "1984" commercial, reading all about SJ & Woz and how they wanted to "change the world", I made it my mission to work at this amazing company. Apple hired me right after graduation and I spent the next 5+ years working with some of the most creative, bright, talented people ever. I was able to attend a few of SJ's employee meetings & product intros before he was unceremoniously "ousted" in that summer of '85, and It was amazing the power he had when he spoke in front of an audience. He's still the best, most evangelical, amazing speaker/presenter/showman I've ever seen. A master, bar none! Can't wait to finish the book and learn more about what drove this amazing man to do all that he did.

Oops! The publishers forgot to include a subtitle, so I've taken the liberty of helping them come up with one. May I suggest:Steve Jobs: Unrelenting Narcissist, Suspected Sociopath and Giant Fucking AssholeIsaacson writes a great biography: He tells a coherent, cohesive story, he interviews all the players and most important he doesn't feel the need to hoist his subject on a pedestal with his pen. When it comes to carrying a story, our author did all the right things.His subject, however, left much to be desired. It's startling to see how someone can be so immensely successful in one aspect of his life and such a complete, utter failure in virtually every other. To illuminate just a few of the many failings of Steve Jobs, allow me to expound upon my proposed subtitle:Unrelenting Narcissist: It's true that if you're going to launch a business in a cutthroat industry and be willing to fight to the death to succeed, you gotta believe in yourself. Jobs, however, took a little positive self-esteem to a whole new level and chose to recreate truth to position himself in the best light. He steals the concept of the GUI from Xerox and it's collaborative sharing, but Microsoft does, well, anything and it's because they're thieves, and we have no respect for thieves. Good ideas? He took credit for them, even if he would veto them upon first review. The man truly believed he could do no wrong, and I can't help but think he probably, just before taking his last breath, was thinking, "Well there goes the future of Apple." Suspected Sociopath: To be clear, I'm using the term "sociopath" like I would if I were Wong's junior psychologist on SVU: that is, to define someone with an anti-social personality disorder. The man - Jobs, not Wong; Wong is amazing - fit the profile to a T: Despite having the ability to charm someone's head off when he needed to, Jobs had an absolute lack of genuine regard for almost everyone around him - his wife, his employees, his poor, cast-aside daughters (his son seemed to escape his scorn, which is a charmingly sexist detail), even his supporters (I can't bring myself to call them friends) who were there for him from the beginning. If a person could not - or could no longer - provide a benefit to Jobs, he would cast them aside...but not before cruelly shitting mounds of aggression and abuse all over their bare heads. See? Sociopath. Giant Fucking Asshole: There are seriously almost too many examples of this to count, but let me curate a sample for your consideration. 1). He screwed one of the founding members of Apple out of founders stock that would now be practically priceless. 2). He thinks he can explain away the abuse he doled out to employees by saying that was "just who I am." Seriously? Do you not think that the people around you want to rip your head off every single day? They do, I assure you. But you know what? They hold it in, because collaborative, encouraging environments are better for everyone (unless you're a narcissist and/or a sociopath, in which case, see above). 3). There's something atrocious about a multi-multi-multi-billionaire who can envision how personal computers/GUIs/the mouse/touchscreens/computer animation/digital music/tablets/etc. can change the world for rich consumers, but who can't see that a fraction of his wealth could have changed the world for people who don't have water. It's undeniable that Jobs was fantastically talented and will go down in the books as one of the great visionaries in history. I'm writing my review on my MacBook, and both my iPhone and my iPad (as well as a slew of iPods, Nanos and Shuffles) are nearby, so I guess the guy was doing something right. Still, I don't believe that being an asshole is the answer, and I don't believe it gets better results; it may not get worse results, but if today's Apple is what he created with vinegar, then I'd love to see what he could have done with honey.

I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss. He was always such a warrior for technological evolution, conceiving products that we didn't know we needed until we held them in our hands. I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket.

I was a little surprised when Steve Jobs died that I actually had an emotional reaction of loss. He was always such a warrior for technological evolution, conceiving products that we didn't know we needed until we held them in our hands. I didn't know I needed an iPod, now I can't travel anywhere without slipping 13,000 songs into my pocket. I now have a playlist for any situation, a wedding, a long drive, robbing a bank, meditation etc. What was so unique about Jobs was that he was a creative person who also had the power to bring a progressive product to life. Good ideas did not die in committee at Apple or Pixar. For some reason conservative leaning people elevate to the highest positions in business in this country. Apple also went through a period of time when Jobs was too radical for a board of directors who wanted to make Apple more like other companies. After reading this biography, I know now that Jobs deserved to be ousted, and what a great occurrence for the world because Pixar would have never been created. He benefited from his time away, learning lessons of consolidating power. When Apple floundered and Jobs was brought back he was much better equipped to lead a company I have always been mystified by the divisions in the country between Apple and Microsoft. I have owned a lot more Apple products than I have PC based products. So without even realizing I guess at some point I joined team Jobs. I used Apples and PCs without really thinking I was being disloyal to a brand, but I have been on the periphery of many heated arguments discussing the merits of PC versus the merits of Macs. I always felt that Jobs was the guy with the concepts and ideas and Gates was sitting around twiddling his thumbs waiting for Jobs to come up with the next "great thing" so he could clone it. There is more truth in that statement than fervent PC believers would like to admit.One of Jobs ex-girlfriends happened to read in a psychiatric manual about Narcissistic personality Disorder and decided that Jobs perfectly met the criteria. "It fit so well and explained so much of what we had struggled with, that I realized expecting him to be nicer or less self-centered was like expecting a blind man to see." Jobs was brutal to his employees, to his family, and to his business partners. One of his favorite lines when looking at a new concept was to say "this is shit". He was a ranter, skilled with skewering insults, contemptuously rude, and yet so sensitive to any slight. When faced with a fond memory or a beautiful concept that he loved he would burst into tears. To say the least, being in the Steve Jobs orbit would have been not only stressful, but confusing. The people that did the best with him were the people that pushed through the "distortion field" that Jobs was nestled in his whole life. For all his failings as a human being and as a boss he was also a talented communicator inspiring people way beyond what they thought they were capable of accomplishing. He firmly believed that nothing was worth doing unless it was going to change the world and that belief was infectious to those that worked with him. When Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer I can remember thinking to myself that no one had ever beaten that form of cancer, but I also thought to myself if anyone can it would be Steve Jobs. His money bought him time. They were able to map the gene of the cancer that was trying to kill him and better target chemo and drugs that would most effectively control the growth of the cancer. "One of his doctors told him that there was hope that his cancer, and others like it, would soon be considered a manageable chronic disease, which could be kept at bay until the patient died of something else." As Jobs said, "I'm either going to be one of the first to be able to outrun a cancer like this, or I'm going to be one of the last to die from it." As we know he lost his battle with cancer, but certainly the money he threw at the disease will end up benefiting all of us. Walter Isaacson is an excellent biographer, I enjoyed his Benjamin Franklin bio very much and intend to read the Einstein biography as well. Steve approached Isaacson to write his biography and Isaacson asked him if he wanted him to write it because he associated himself with Einstein and Franklin. Jobs didn't deny it. He was well aware of his place in history. I liked Steve Jobs more before reading this biography. I have a deeper understanding of how and why he was so successful. I can not emulate his management style nor would I ever want to. He was a destructive personality that inspired creativity. I feel we are diminished by his absence from the ranks and I can only hope there is a young person in a messy garage, tinkering with the concept that will be the next "thing" that will change our lives.

I'm still not entirely sure what to think. I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired.I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there. I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or
I'm still not entirely sure what to think. I keep flipflopping between annoyed/disgusted and inspired.I applaud Isaacson for putting a masterful bio together without succumbing to the Reality Distortion Field and vomiting out a piece of Jobs-worship like some Apple/Steve-related books out there. I also really appreciate all these little anecdotes, some that I have seen before and others that are new and all the more enjoyable, that people that knew and interacted with Steve shared in one way or another.On the other hand, I like my personal heroes to have a smidgen of friendly and positive virtues like courtesy and generosity. This book blows away many times over any idea I had that Steve might have been a nice guy at heart with occasional and sometimes very public extremism. The stories related to his daughters and many other women in his personal life nauseated me. I'm frustrated that what I already knew to be his horrifying but effective work attitude also crossed over to his personal life. I appreciate his work and his efforts and he is singlehandedly responsible for me being what I am today, but I despise myself at the moment for having thought this dickless asshole as an awesome role model when I was younger. I wasn't expecting perfection in this regard since we are all human after all, but it was eye opening to see the whole picture in a single book.But that is what I signed up for when I decided to read a no holds barred official bio of Steve, I suppose. Good and bad and worse, all packaged together in a book that is no less beautiful than the products Apple puts out. Tomorrow, I will probably feel bad about this review and feel more inspired by the positive aspects of this bio to push myself harder to work better and to do what is right, like Steve would have done. Then the next day I will be frustrated that he didn't have surgery sooner and think about the what ifs. Rinse, repeat.edit: Tomorrow is today... and Mona's eulogy for her brother is in the NYT (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/opi...). I think that wonderful eulogy brought more tears to my eyes than this bio or even his death did. Short, simple but beautiful, and more importantly, shows me another side of Steve that is more like the person I thought he was before I read the bio. The side that cared about his family but was hindered by the cancer, spreading and getting worse. Thanks for restoring my faith, Mona.

Well, The mighty Steve Jobs that we have so much to learn from.The bookWalter Isaacson the author is a well-know writer (Einstein, Franklin are his other biography books) has covered all the aspects of Job's life from his childhood, family, friends, to founding apple with Wozniak, each product design (Macintosh, iphone etc.) and venture (Next, Pixar) he conveyed. The book has benefited a lot from articulation of Walter Isaacson and the content are precise with rich details as he has interviewed all the people he's named in the book as well as Steve Job.The best thing about reading biographies and the very reason why I love biographies is the lessons you can learn from the bests. Having a business guru like jobs as a mentor is a blessing not everyone can have and fortunately enough, biographies makes this dream come close to reality. So here are the best things I've learned about Jobs:Jobs Core Personality Traits and Management Ethics1. Jobs was an abandoned child, and when he asked his mom and dad if his real parents didn't want him, they repeated slowly: "We specifically picked you out". So, abandoned, chosen, special, became part of what Jobs regarded himself of. 2. From early in childhood, his dad who was a skilled mechanic would take him to show him how repairing is done. He would point out to him the detailing of the designs, lines, vents etc. Jobs also watched his father a lot using his skills in negotiations when bargaining the parts he wanted to purchase. These experience with his father instilled within him persuasion skills and attention to details that came in handy later in his career.3. Another impacting force on Jobs views was his childhood search of neighborhood exposing him to simple, smart, cheap houses that were build by Joseph Eichler. From these exposures and later his Zen practices, he developed an orientation towards simplicity that influenced later all his ideas and designs. 4. A core personality trait of Jobs which had a significant impact on all his achievements was him being relentless on getting what he needed or what he deemed to be right:That summer of 1972, after his graduation, he and Brennan moved to a cabin in the hills above Los Altos. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go live in a cabin with Chrisann,‚Äù he announced to his parents one day. His father was furious. ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOver my dead body.‚Äù They had recently fought about marijuana, and once again the younger Jobs was willful. He just said good-bye and walked out.One day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and wanted to be hired there, and told the personnel director, who was startled by his unkempt hair and attire, that he wouldn‚Äôt leave until they gave him a job. :D 5. Perhaps the boldest of Jobs traits was his Reality Distortion Field which made him believe what seemed utterly impossible to others and he would always persist that something odd could be done and interestingly enough, he would be often right. 6. He would refuse to accept automatically received truths, and he wanted to examine everything himself. 7. Jobs had came to belief that he could impart his feeling of confidence to others and thus push them to do things they hadn't thought possible8. A remarkable thing that helped Jobs what he eventually became was his engagement with many great people and mentors and getting into different businesses and careers. For instance:The Atari experience helped shape Jobs‚Äôs approach to business and design. He appreciated the user friendliness of Atari‚Äôs insert-quarter-avoid-Klingons games. ‚ÄúThat simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person,‚Äù said Ron Wayne. Jobs also absorbed some of Bushnell‚Äôs take-non-prisoners attitude. ‚ÄúNolan wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer,‚Äù according to Alcorn, ‚Äúand this was Steve‚Äôs first impression of how things got done. Nolan was never abusive, like Steve sometimes is. But he had the same driven attitude. It made me cringe, but dammit, it got things done. In that way Nolan was a mentor for Jobs.‚Äù 9. Bushnell tought Jobs:I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, ‚ÄòPretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.10. Mark Markukula another mentor of Jobs taught him:You should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last. And that is precisely what Job did with apple. He always thought product not profit. Markulla instilled in Jobs the apple philosophy which revolves around three core principles as follows:I. Empathy: an intimate connection with the feelings of customers and understanding their needs.II. Focus: To do what must be done, every other unimportant opportunities must me eliminated. III. Impute: People from an opinion about a company or product based on the signals that it onveys. "People DO judge a book by its cover." If you present your great product in a slipshod manner, it they will be perceived as slipshod.11. From Alan Kay a Xerox mighty scientist Jobs embraced and applied two Maxims:I. The best way to predict the future is to invent it.II. People who are serious about software should make their own hardware.12. A great thing I've noticed being the root of many extraordinary feats has been this:Because I didn't know how it couldn't be done, I was enabled to do it.13. Jobs has been an all-time perfectionist and always complaint that young generation has no such quality ingrained in them.14. Jobs would never compromise quality and perfection in favor of lowering the costs, nor would he care about how much longer the project would be delayed to meet his expectations.15. Jobs would always argue that "By expecting people to do great things, you can get them to do great things." This actually has proven psychological roots. 16. From Bill Atkinson: "Great art stretches the taste, it doesn't follow the tastes."17. "No, because customers don't know what they want until we've shown them", this is what Jobs kept replying whoever suggested doing some market research.18. The journey is the reward. Jobs favorite maxim which too has proven neuropsychological roots. As soon as you reach your goal, the joy vanishes. (Look up dopamine working mechanism and its effects if interested).19. Another Job's favorite maxim was: "It's better to be a pirate than to join te navy." He wanted to instill a rebel spirit in his team to have them behave like swashbucklers who were proud of their work but willing to commandeer from others.20. Sculley former PEPSI, the first apple CEO had a weakness to manage a dysfunctional company was his desire to please other people, one of many traits that he did not share with Jobs:We would go to the Mac building at eleven at night,‚Äù Sculley recalled, ‚Äúand they would bring Jobs code to show. In some cases he wouldn‚Äôt even look at it. He would just take it and throw it back at them. I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHow can you turn it down?‚Äô And he would say, ‚ÄòI know they can do better.‚Äô‚Äù21. Microsoft followed a different philosophy, their initial products were often clumsy, but they were extremely persistent, so they kept improving and improving their works.22. Jobs had a profound emphasis on recruiting only and only A players:Jobs had latched onto what he believed was a key management lesson from his Macintosh experience: You have to be ruthless if you want to build a team of A players. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too easy, as a team grows, to put up with a few B players, and they then attract a few more B players, and soon you will even have some C players,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúThe Macintosh experience taught me that A players like to work only with other A players, which means you can‚Äôt indulge B players.‚Äù23. As I traversed through the book, I noticed several things contributing to Jobs ability to come up with ideas:I. He always have been on the edge of the technology and art, aware what's the latest achievements of scientific and artistic communities.II. He actively would canvass academics to inquire them on their needs and shortcoming to see if he could come up with a solution.III. Part of his routines what holding occasional retreats with top 100 managers to a resort and keep brainstorming ideas and selecting top 3 out of n+1 proposed ones. 24. What prepared Jobs for great success was getting fired from apple in act I, starting the "Next" venture and indulging and failing in any type of projects he desire. In short, his failures made him the "Steve" we know on act III (which is returning to apple).25. This one is a bit dark: When he wanted to acquire something that others wouldn't let go of (like his daughter Lisa from his ex-wife) he would spark off a destructive route of ignorance. In case of his daughter, he undermined his ex's effectiveness and her well being to get Lisa to move into his house. 26. A lesson Jobs learned from his Buddhist days was that material possessions often cluttered life than enriched it. 27. One thing the Jobs believed lead to the down fall of apple after he left the company with Sculley was that "Sculley destroyed apple by bringing in corrupt people and corrupt values," "They cared about making money for themselves mainly, and also for apple, rather than making great products. 28. If Jobs new for sure a course of action was right, he was unstoppable. But if he had doubts, he sometimes withdrew, preferring not to thinking about things that did not perfectly suit him.29. Job's ambition was to build a company that would endure, and he asked Markulla what the formula for that would be. Markulla replied that lasting companies know ho to reinvent themselves.30. A beautiful phrase I read was Job saying: We at apple have forgotten who we were. 
One way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.
31. One of Jobs greatest strength was knowing how to focus. "Deciding what not to o is as important as deciding what to do," he said. "That's true for companies, and it's true for products."After a few weeks Jobs finally had enough. ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù he shouted at one big product strategy session. ‚ÄúThis is crazy.‚Äù He grabbed a magic marker, padded to a whiteboard, and drew a horizontal and vertical line to make a four-squared chart. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we need,‚Äù he continued. Atop the two columns he wrote ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù and ‚ÄúPro‚Äù; he labeled the two rows ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù and ‚ÄúPortable.‚Äù Their job, he said, was to make four great products, one for each quadrant. ‚ÄúThe room was in dumb silence,‚Äù Schiller recalled. There was also a stunned silence when Jobs presented the plan to the September meeting of the Apple board. ‚ÄúGil had been urging us to approve more and more products every meeting,‚Äù Woolard recalled. ‚ÄúHe kept saying we need more products. Steve came in and said we needed fewer. He drew a matrix with four quadrants and said that this was where we should focus.‚Äù At first the board pushed back. It was a risk, Jobs was told. ‚ÄúI can make it work,‚Äù he replied. The board never voted on the new strategy. Jobs was in charge, and he forged ahead. 32. Jobs used and benefited a lot from his tuition. In case of designs, he would point to models and sketches he liked and dump on the ones he didn't. 33. Perhaps one of the greatest maxims Jobs wove into fabric of apple's designs was Davincii's mantra: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."It take a lot of hard work He said, "to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions." As Ive remarkably uttered:  Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn‚Äôt just a visual style. It‚Äôs not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it‚Äôs manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential. 34. To make Ive's aesthetic desires and various design whims come into reality, Jobs had to fend off the objections of the manufacturing engineers. 
When we took the designs to the engineers, Jobs said, they came up with thirty-eight reasons they couldn't do it. And I said, 'No, no, we're doing this.' And they said, 'Well, why?' And I said, 'Because I'm the CEO, and I think it can be done.' And so they kind of grudgingly did it.
35. Jobs followed this strategy that made apple successful the whole time: Make hit product and promote them with terrific marketing. 36. Steve firmly deemed motivation to be crucial: The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don‚Äôt really love music or art the way we do. We won because we personally love music. We made the iPod for ourselves, and when you‚Äôre doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you‚Äôre not going to cheese out. If you don‚Äôt love something, you‚Äôre not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much. 37. One of Jobs's business rules was to never be afraid of cannibalizing yourself. If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will, he said.38. In designing products, apple would come up several models, pick one, and keep refining them till it seemed perfect. 39. He believed (and recently have been advocated by many creativity gurus) that creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they're doing, you say 'Wow,' and soon you're cooking up all sorts of ideas. So apple designed his building to promote random encounters of employees who would not be aware of each other otherwise. 40. What made iphone successful was simplifying things that was complex to deal with in other phones.41. Jobs had his theory on why great companies like IBM decline. "The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don't matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. After all as Dylan says: 
If you're not busy being born, you're busy dying.
Strange and funny facts about Jobs1. He was always walking around barefoot,‚Äù he later told a reporter. ‚ÄúThe thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.‚Äù Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. ‚ÄúOne of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.‚Äù2. Just because Jobs tells you that something is awful or great, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he‚Äôll feel that way tomorrow,‚Äù Tribble explained. ‚ÄúIf you tell him a new idea, he‚Äôll usually tell you that he thinks it‚Äôs stupid. But then, if he actually likes it, exactly one week later, he‚Äôll come back to you and propose your idea to you, as if he thought of it. :)))3. An event ran in apple to award the person who stood up to Jobs and for what he/she believes. :D4. A nice reply once Jobs gave to a reporter when was asked "Why is your Next device gonna be so late?" was: "It's not late, its gonna be five years ahead of its time."5. The "i" in apple's naming was to emphasize that the devices would be seamlessly integrated with the internet. 6. Jobs sometimes avoided the truth. Helmut Sonnenfeldt once said of Henry Kissinger, ‚ÄúHe lies not because it‚Äôs in his interest, he lies because it‚Äôs in his nature.‚Äù It was in Jobs‚Äôs nature to mislead or be secretive when he felt it was warranted. But he also indulged in being brutally honest at times, telling the truths that most of us sugarcoat or suppress. Both the dissembling and the truth-telling were simply different aspects of his Nietzschean attitude that ordinary rules didn‚Äôt apply to him.7. Jobs frequently encouraged youths to try LSD as it's been amongst his most influential experiences...Hope you enjoyed :)

In a way, I regard this book as a balanced biography. Even though Walter Isaacson is apparently unsatisfied with having gotten all of Steve Jobs's shaft into his mouth and spends a lot of time sucking on Jobs's balls, his recounting of Steve Jobs's behavior left me unavoidably with the impression that Steve Jobs was a world-class asshole. Jobs is presented as so much of a whining, pathetic bully that I find myself glad that he died of pancreatic cancer, and I also find myself regretting that he did not die sooner.[paragraph listing instances of Jobs's assholish behavior]In Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, the sentence "Glanton spat." appears almost like a refrain in a song. Glanton does a lot of spitting. In Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs, the clause "Jobs cried" appears with the same frequency. Jobs does a lot of crying. Jobs would cry any time he didn't get his way. His tendency to cry makes me wish I--as technically inept as Jobs himself--could bully someone cleverer than I into building a time machine, so I could use it to go back in time and beat the crap out of Steve Jobs.He fucked over Woz.He continually told people that they were shit.He was duped by John Sculley.He held people in contempt when they didn't behave like assholes.He demanded that a machine in a factory be painted. It fucked up the machine.On The Subject of Jobs's 30th Birthday Party--------------------------------------------"Many people had picked out special gifts for a person who was not easy to shop for. Debi Coleman, for example, found a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Last Tycoon'. But Jobs, in an act that was odd yet not out of character, left all of the gifts in a hotel room."page 189For contrast, on my 30th birthday I bought myself a dog toy in the shape of a plush shotgun shell. It squeaked when you squeezed it. My sister's then-boyfriend did some repairs on my car, which was really nice of him. My point is that Steve Jobs is an inconsiderate asshole.It's kind of fun to read this book if you think of it as a drinking game where you drink every time Steve Jobs is an asshole. You'd be dead of alcohol poisoning by page 10 if you actually drank every time Isaacson reported an instance of Steve Jobs being an asshole. But it's kind of fun to be surprised on every page by a new way in which Jobs is an asshole. Jobs is an inexhaustible genius of finding ways to be an asshole. Look at this shit, from page 188:[...] Andy Cunningham, from Regis McKenna's firm, was in charge of hand-holding and logistics at the Carlyle. When Jobs arrived, he told her that his suite needed to be completely redone, even though it was 10 p.m. and the meetings were to begin the next day. The piano was not in the right place; the strawberries were the wrong type. But his biggest objection was that he didn't like the flowers. He wanted calla lilies. "We got into a big fight on what a calla lily is," Cunningham recalled. "I know what they are, because I had them at my wedding, but he insisted on having a different type of lily and said I was 'stupid' because I didn't know what a real calla lily was." So Cunningham went out and, this being New York, was able to find a place open at midnight where she could get the lilies he wanted. By the time they got the room rearranged, Jobs started objecting to what she was wearing. "That suit's disgusting," he told her. Cunningham knew that at times he just simmered with undirected anger, so she tried to calm him down. "Look, I know you're angry, and I know how you feel," she said.""You have no fucking idea how I feel," he shot back, "no fucking idea what it's like to be me."I'll tell you what it feels like to be Steve Jobs: it feels like you're a fucking asshole.[All of page 462 should be included here, to show what an asshole Jobs is, even after he has had cancer.]This book could also have been called The Crying Asshole. See for yourself:Page 197: "Then he began to cry."Steve Jobs, a cause of crying in others as well as himself: "After Jobs stalked out, Sculley turned away from the glass wall of his office, where others had been looking in on the meeting, and wept." (page 199)Page 202: "He went back to his office, gathered his longtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff, and started to cry."Page 206: 'It finally sank in. Jobs realized there was no appeal, no way to warp the reality. He broke down in tears and started making phone calls--to Bill Campbell, Jay Elliot, Mike Murray, and others. Murray's wife, Joyce., was on an overseas call when Jobs phoned, and the operator broke in saying it was an emergency. It better be important, she told the operator. "It is," she heard Jobs say. When her husband got on the phone, Jobs was crying. "It's over," he said. Then he hung up.'See? Crying and callously breaking into someone else's expensive overseas phone call because you couldn't hack it.Page 208: Years later Jobs's eyes welled with tears as he recounted the story [...]Page 442: They all hugged, and Jobs wept.-------------------------------------------Part II of this ReviewIsaacson's biography is soft and untechnical, and that's a real shame because it's the anointed-by-Steve-Jobs-himself biography that, at least for the moment, is the Steve Jobs biography of record.Isaacson is not up to the task of explaining what Jobs did when he was at NeXT. That's a shame, because Jobs's work at NeXT forms the basis for everything that Apple is today.There are a couple of reasons an author might want to avoid trying to explain what Jobs did at NeXT. The main reason is that it's fucking complicated. The other reason is that it's boring for most people to read about. (Take it from me, a paid technical writer.) I suspect that Isaacson does not have the technical understanding necessary to explain why the NeXT years were important. It would have taken months and possibly as much as a couple of years for Isaacson to develop the understanding he would need to explain how NeXT was different, and what it made possible that wasn't possible before. Clearly Isaacson didn't find that appealing. Also, probably most of the reading public doesn't want to read a highly technical explanation of the innovations that went into the NeXT operating system.But that means that this book fails to describe the major achievement of Jobs's life. This is probably going to be the biography of record for Steve Jobs. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to determine how shitty this is.For comparison, Isaacson spends five pages (411-415) describing the contents of Jobs's playlist. Isaacson even talks about how he and Jobs sat around listening to the music on Jobs's iPad2, and reports things that Jobs says about the songs he's listening to. Except for when Jobs is yelling at people for stupid bullshit, he never seems more common in this biography than when he is saying dumb wistful stuff about Boomer music on his iPad2.Here's Jobs, bloviating about The Beatles while listening to the recording sessions for "Strawberry Fields Forever":It's a complex song, and it's fascinating to watch the creative process as they went back and forth and finally created it over a few months. Lennon was always my favorite Beatle. [He laughs as Lennon stops during the first take and makes the band go back and revise a chord.] Did you hear that little detour they took? It didn't work, so they went back and started from where they were. It's so raw in this version. It actually makes them sound like mere mortals. You could actually imagine other people doing this, up to this version. Maybe not writing and conceiving it, but certainly playing it. Yet they just didn't stop. They were such perfectionists they keep it going and going. This made a big impression on me when I was in my thirties. You could just tell how much they worked at this.They did a bundle of work between each of these recordings. They kept sending it back to make it closer to perfect. [As he listens to the third take, he points out how the instrumentation has gotten more complex.] The way we build stuff at Apple is often this way. Even the number of models we'd make of a new notebook or iPod. We would start off with a version and then begin refining and refining, doing detailed models of the design, or the buttons, or how a function operates. It's a lot of work, but in the end it just gets better, and soon it's like, "Wow, how did they do that?!? Where are the screws?"pp.418-419So there's Steve Jobs, convincing himself that he invented iterative design because he heard the Beatles do something like it. It's kind of like how Eddie Van Halen says that he realized he could tap when he was at a Led Zeppelin concert and he saw Jimmy Page play the open G string and then hammer on the A on the second fret over and over again. Except in this case, it has nothing to do with guitar playing and everything to do with Steve Jobs convincing himself that he invented iterative design and then cramming his own cock into his throat. The only real consolation to be had in this story is that pancreatic cancer is eating him.-----------------------Part III of this ReviewIsaacson has an easier time of explaining the end of Jobs's life, because he stays away from technical material and focuses on easy-to-understand numbers that tell easy-to-understand stories. Here's an example, from the part of the book describing when Jobs convinced Disney to buy Pixar:The deal the proposed was that Disney would purchase Pixar for $7.4 billion in stock. Jobs would thus become Disney's largest shareholder, with approximately 7% of the company's stock compared to 1.7% owned by Eisner and 1$ by Roy Disney. Disney Animation would be put under Pixar, with Lasseter and Catmull running the combined unit. Pixar would retain its independent identity, its studio and headquarters would remain in Emeryville, and it would even keep its own email addresses.(p.441)This story's pretty straightforward: Jobs is rich, and then he gets richer. That's a lot easier to understand than the technical innovations of NeXT. And it's in the book, unlike the technical part of the NeXT years.When discussing Apple's decision to dump the PowerPC and move to Intel microprocessors, Issacson gets about as technical as he ever gets:Bill Gates was amazed. Designing crazy-colored cases did not impress him, but a secret program to switch the CPU in a computer, completed seamlessly and on time, was a feat he truly admired. "If you'd said 'Okay, we're going to change our microprocessor chip, and we're not going to lose a beat,' that sounds impossible," he told me years later, when I asked him about Jobs's accomplishments. "They basically did that."(p.448)I want to make sure to point out some examples of Isaacson sucking the cock of Steve Jobs, to bolster my claim that this is less a biography and more an advertisement for Steve Jobs. So here's a paragraph lifted verbatim from a part of the book where Isaacson is reporting on Steve Jobs's 2005 Stanford commencement speech:The artful minimalism of the speech gave it simplicity, purity, and charm. Search where you will, from anthologies to YouTube, and you won't find a better commencement address. Others may have been more important, such as George Marshall's at Harvard in 1947 announcing a plan to rebuild Europe, but none has had more grace.(page 457)Slurp, slurp, slurp.---UPDATE 09 Feb 2014---Virtuous men, busy in the affairs of life, and occupied continually in the saying of virtuous words and the doing of virtuous deeds, are apt to lose track of one lone expression of virtue, however excellent and meritorious, amid the endless succession of righteous and virtuous actions of which their admirable and praiseworthy lives consist. And so it is with unfeigned gratitude that I greet the comment of Hazem Bayado, who, upon seeing my excellent review of Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs, was moved to express this:How can one hate a review here!! While the reviewer mentioned some important points, in particular the NeXT years, or the absence of them actually, I found his continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting and generally degrading for the review. Ok so Steve Jobs was an asshole in your mind, but what do you call someone who is happy and satisfied about the fact that cancer is eating another human alive? Asshole is an understatement!!!Hazem Bayado's comment brought again to my attention the nearly-forgotten review of Steve Jobs that I composed last May, and thereby afforded me the opportunity to be pleased and delighted by my assessment of the character of Steve Jobs, and to marvel at how correct I was at so tender and green an age, when my judgment was much younger and less-tried than it is today.I should like to take this opportunity to dedicate myself anew to the proposition I articulated here eight months ago to the amusement and enlightenment of so many, that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Why, just the other day, Mark Ames reported that Steve Jobs was involved in a conspiracy to drive down the wages of developers in Silicon Valley: http://goo.gl/C9FBnp. Truly, this is a genius asshole, a Tupac of assholery, to continue from beyond the grave to give reporters material for new reports of assholery of kinds heretofore undared. What fool, having been presented with this information, would gainsay the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole? What depravity could give rise to such foolishness?I am sorry that Hazem Bayado found my "continuous sexual analogies to be juvenile, distracting, and generally degrading for the review", but I do wish him well.Is it too much to hope that Hazem Bayado will be able to suck greater command of the English language out of a dick? I do hope it isn't, because all people of parts, with their faculties keen to the happenings of the world, can not fail to mark, and can probably not refrain from remaking upon, just how very much he sucks dick. I hope that he manages to suck greater command of the English language out of one of the endless parade of dicks that marches down his throat, so that he may be less a target of sport for those of us with greater command of the tongue.In closing, I can see nothing to alter my earlier judgment, and it is with a great sense of pride that I sustain that earlier judgment and re-dedicate myself to the proposition that Steve Jobs is an asshole. Thank you, Hazem Bayado, for allowing me to spend time in the company of my former self, admiring his courage and revelling in the wisdom of his superior judgment.------------------------23 Oct 2015In writing Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson has created a long, posthumous public-relations-style press release for Steve Jobs. In doing this, he has done one of two things. (1) Isaacson has acquiesced to becoming a part of Jobs's strategy to draw attention away from substantive and historical questions that show Jobs in a negative light and worked to draw attention toward easily-understood narratives that show Jobs in a positive light and that are accessible to the average reader. (2) Isaacson has cluelessly been manipulated by Steve Jobs into becoming a part of the strategy to show Jobs in a positive light, giving attention to popular matters of little substance at the expense of substantive technical questions and historically important business dealings. Neither option increases Isaacson's credibility as a biographer.Episodes 42 and 43 of the podcast "Hypercritical" by John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin discuss the technical shallowness of Isaacson's biography of Jobs: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42 http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43Mark Ames has covered "Techtopus", a wage-fixing scam orchestrated by Google and Steve Jobs. Whatever Isaacson has written in his biography about Jobs's appreciation of The Beatles or his having dating Joni Mitchell or his white-boy, tourist love of India, whatever he has written is simply public relations, and will remain hopelessly so for as long as he adds no examination of Jobs's role in wage-fixing: https://pando.com/tag/techtopus/Randall Strouss's Steve Jobs and The Next Big Thing remains the book of record for getting a foundation in the innovations of NeXT. The absence of substantive examination of NeXT in Isaacson's book combined with the attention given to Jobs's musical preferences demonstrates the unseriousness of Isaacson's biography. Here's Strouss's book, which as a kind of bonus has the best single-chapter introduction to the innovations of Xerox in the 1970s at the Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...

Update: I 'did' read this a ways back - my friend gave me her book when done--her husband is still living - a Survivor of pancreatic cancer! Doing well! At the time when I read this - I was actually wanting to read as much as I could about the his cancer -( because of my friend John).There wasn't enough to pull anything from---yet-I was fascinated with everything else. Nobody has made a bigger difference in the quality of people's lives, in my lifetime, than Steve Jobs. It bothered me though that the criticism about him was a little too repetitive for me-it kept being driven home.So... in updating this old review today, my reason in doing so, is that I just finished listening to another Steve Jobs book which I enjoyed -Becoming Steve Jobs".If there are still people who have not read any biography, or seen any movie, about Steve Jobs....I think you're missing out by not doing so. He was the visionary leader in our lifetime that made the biggest difference to the most amount of people.OLD NEWS:I'm not sure when I'll read this book ---(I've got others to read first)---but my friend has pancreatic cancer ---(the SAME TYPE as Steve Jobs). Enough inspiration to want me to read this book.John also lives in the same town as the Jobs family...(only a few miles away) ---John is another GREAT mind, ---a psychiatrist for 40 years ---(Harvard Educated) Married 40 years -- 2 adult daughters --- 2 twin grand sons. I'm sad Steve Jobs died...he was brilliant --(would have loved to see things he would have continued to create for another 40 years)

I started this book with two questions: Was Steve Jobs an asshole? And if so... did he need to be to accomplish what he did?Having just finished it, I don't have a good answer to either question. In fact both seem foolishly simplistic given this rich, sweeping, detailed, and intimate depiction a truly remarkable man's life experience.What I learned about Steve Jobs is that he was very good at some things, and very bad at others. Among the things he was very good at, his true genius lay in his ability to develop products people love at the intersection of engineering and humanities. Later in life he shifted more of his energies toward building a company that institutionalized this genius, though it will be a while before we learn whether he succeeded.What I learned about life - or about business, anyway - is that both our strengths and our weaknesses shape the things we create. What's remarkable about the life of Steve Jobs is how the psychoses and eccentricities of his personality, when channelled through his defining product genius, created the world's most valuable company. His is not the story of a man overcoming the limitations of his worldview; it's the story of a man who changed the world itself to accomodate it.You are not Steve Jobs, as Allen Kelly pointed out in his insightful blog post a few weeks back. But maybe there's a lesson for all of us in the story of a man who brought some beauty into the world not just because of the gifts that made him a genius, but because of the flaws and idiosyncrasies that made him a person.

Along with Steve the brilliant innovator who knew how to bring together an A-list team of loyal employees, we get Steve the rude man who will proclaim a product or food or wedding invitation as "shit" and then walk away with a clear conscience; Steve the man who has no qualms about crying in front of others if he doesn't get his way or is overburdened; Steve the selfish man who doesn't bother to remember birthdays or anniversaries; Steve the lousy father who denied fathering his first daughter for the first six years of her life, and who wasn't there much for his three children with Powell. I was surprised when I learned that Jobs was not only cooperating with Isaacson on this book, but sought him out. Steve explained that it was because he wanted his children to truly know their father, and I'm so glad that I got to know him, too.

Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine. I hate Time Magazine.He prefers telling to showing in his prose, reminds us of his theses whenever they apply, and conveys emotion via bludgeoning, shallow diction. It's that last point that most bothers me, since it leaked into his disappointing performance as an interviewer as well: for instance, he notes dozens of times that someone wept after some event but does not follow up with questions of "why? would you have reacted that way now? how do
Isaacson's book reads just like a Time Magazine. I hate Time Magazine.He prefers telling to showing in his prose, reminds us of his theses whenever they apply, and conveys emotion via bludgeoning, shallow diction. It's that last point that most bothers me, since it leaked into his disappointing performance as an interviewer as well: for instance, he notes dozens of times that someone wept after some event but does not follow up with questions of "why? would you have reacted that way now? how do you think this affected others? how did that influence your decision-making? etc."When Isaacson turned‚Äîrarely‚Äîto analysis, interpretation, and abstraction, he provided little additional depth. The author rarely examined his subject's assertions and ideologies critically. This book, then, is useful not so much as a biography but rather as simply a primary source of quotations and accounts. That's tragic because it's almost certainly the best one we're going to get, yet because of its focus on products over people, it's missing so, so much.Why did Jobs seem to prefer Reed to his daughters? How did Laurene put up with his behavior, and to what extent did she think it necessary to his accomplishments? Did Jobs feel that the ends justify the means with respect to his products, or did he simply fail to notice his often-nasty means? Did he believe that one must behave interpersonally with moral disregard to achieve as he did; if so, why? How would he explain Cook's success via absolutely orthogonal style? How did Laurene feel about his lingering feeling for Redse? What would his board say to the author's implied allegation that they are essentially his puppets?There is so much fascinating depth to Jobs's story that is simply not considered. It's this depth and understanding, I feel, that matters: after all, aren't all of us reading this biography because we wish we could replicate Jobs's achievements, yearn to walk a vicarious mile in his shoes, wonder just how much it cost him? Having finished the book, I'm left wondering whether I have trouble empathizing with Jobs because I simply can't understand his moral and rational framework‚Äîor because Isaacson's account is so frustratingly impersonal and shallow.

Are you a fan of APPLE? Do you hate APPLE? Did you admire Steve Jobs? Did you hate Steve Jobs? No matter your answers, you *really* should read this book. There have been things about APPLE I always disliked. This book made me turn many of these things into things I no longer dislike, but also into things I now understand and yes, even admire. There was many many things I learned in here that I had no clue about. There is no way I think you can read this book and not just totally be in awe of Jobs. Yes, he was a total asshole. It's also clear that he never made apologizes for this. He has some very obvious personal issues. Professional issues as well. What I never understood is what drove him. After reading this, I feel very sure that money was never a driving force in his life. Instead it was always his passions. His passions for PIXAR. His passion for APPLE. His passion to always be the best. Read this book. I am not sure that I've ever read a book that showed a man with such passions. No, this book is not always a nice pretty picture of Jobs. In fact, at times you will think he is complete shit. You will hate him for how he treats his employees. You will marvel at how he justifies his backhanded business ethics. You will stare open mouthed at his tantrums....but through it all, you can't help but to marvel at the man. At all he accomplished. At how he never gave up, no matter who told him it couldn't be done. You will marvel at how he pushes others into greatness. You will wish you could have experienced his "reality distortion field". I also learned so much about APPLE.....I learned and now understand their "closed system" I used to really hate this about APPLE...now I am excited about it....You will understand why they really DID change the world that you and I now know. How many things that Jobs pushed that you don't even realize...but things you would be hard pressed to do without. I wish I had read this book years ago. I wish I had been an APPLE fanatic years ago. I wish I had bothered to learn more about Jobs before his passing. I wish everyone knew just what he did for APPLE. The story about APPLE that I really never knew when he came back to it's helm. Again, no matter what your feelings about the man or the company, this is a book worth reading. If you walk away not learning anything new....well, I would surprised. If you walk away without being a little bit awestruck with the man...well, I would be surprised. Brilliant man.....there is no question....there will never be another like him....and just one more thing.....you shall be missed......you left your mark on us all, Steve.....job well done.....RIP.....

Someone I follow here at GR had recommended it, plus it had been sitting on a shelf in the library forever and I kept bumping into it.So, in spite of my reservations I took it out....and it rewarded me by flying in the face my prejudice. I absolutely loved it ... Walter Isaacson is a superb writer, and in spite of the fact that Jobs was one of the most prickly and outspoken people on the planet - he has done a brilliant job in researching this abrasive genius. And it turns out, after all, that that Steve Jobs was a genius. He often talked to his staff insultingly, or treated them like idiots; he often stole their ideas, or gave them impossible deadlines - at one stage he even wanted them all to wear a uniform. But they kept coming back for more. He had such passion and drive, artistry and originality..... Nothing but perfection would do. Plus he was the ultimate iconic figure of cool. He inspired enormous loyalty in his workforce, and in all those who bought a piece of Apple magic. As Daniel Lyons of Newsweek Magazine said ""He has an uncanny ability to cook up gadgets that we didn't know we needed, but then suddenly can't live without".To read about the life, creativity and development of this man was fascinating. I'm still a Linux person. I ain't no Apple groover. But now I'm prepared to doff my hat to this extraordinary man and his mind-boggling achievements. For all his shortcomings he was a giant in our landscape. I also want to read more books by Walter Isaacson.

The one saving grace was the participation of Steve Jobs, his friends, and family, and this alone rescues the book from a lower rating. Granted, this biography is meant for a mass audience, not someone who is a regular listener of Apple podcasts (yes, like me). The early chapters are fine, though others have pointed out it's largely cribbed from previous books. I was the least familiar with this era, and especially unaware to the extent Jobs was... sorry, it's only way to put this: a fucking whiny little bitch. Every few pages he's crying to get what he wants. Seriously.It's the second half that was a bigger letdown, at least in regard to the inside story of Apple's business decisions and where products are concerned. Sure, there's plenty here, but it's out of chronological order, difficult to follow, and there are big gaps. Isaacson is better at writing about Jobs the individual than he is about Jobs the businessman, and let's not forget that's why we know or care who Steve Jobs was. If you're looking for much more detail than the order in which Apple signed music companies to the iTunes Store, you may be similarly disappointed. If you don't know much more than the broad outlines of Steve Jobs' career, this may be a perfectly worthwhile read. That said, there's also plenty Isaacson gets wrong; I defer to John Siracusa on specific errors and omissions by Isaacson, and as of this writing he's only halfway there: http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42

Walter Isaacson often uses the word "prickly" in reference to Steve Jobs's personality and management style. Remove the "ly" and you'll be closer to the truth. 'Nuff said.

Full Review
If you ask people their opinion of Steve Jobs, you may get a wide variety of answers. To many he was this brilliant innovator and designer, with a cult-like following. To me though, he's largely been an overpraised Asshole who got more credit than he deserved. This book has changed my opinions somewhat. 1) He's a larger asshole than even I thought. 2) He does deserves more of the credit that I was was willing to give him for several key impacts to technology and culture.I earn my living as a Software Engineer. My love of computers came at an early age. My first computer: An Apple IIgs. I came to learn this was basically a souped up version of the original Apple II with improvements borrowed from the Macintosh after that failed to be a success and Steve Jobs was maneuvered out of power at Apple.While to most people that will never be a device of significance, it changed my life. I still have it. I still love it. It's also the only Apple product I've ever owned, and I wasn't the one who bought it, my parents were. I've always had a hate/love relationship with Apple. I can appreciate the innovations of many Apple products: The Mac, The iPod, iPhone and iPad. But I've never wanted to own one. I find the closed nature of their products and lack of customization frustrating and a deal breaker. Steve Wozniak is my favorite Apple Steve, not Mr. Jobs.Without Steve Jobs, some of these products may never have come to be, and certainly not as early. And they certainly wouldn't have been Apple products. He didn't really design or innovate much though. What he did was push his talented engineers to innovate and accomplish things even they didn't think possible. He largely did this by being an asshole. Constantly. Calling people's ideas shit one week then taking credit for them as his own the next. Oh and that doesn't get into all the issues he had as a father or friend.I could never have worked for Apple or Jobs. I probably wouldn't have been up to his standards anyways. As a huge computer/technology fan though, this is a must read book. Like him or hate him you can't disregard his impact on not only technology but culture.My Windows PC (or Linux PC for that matter) wouldn't be the same without the Mac (although I think far too many people are unaware of the innovations of Xerox PARC engineers). My Android phone wouldn't be nearly as good without the iPhone.My favorite quote from this book came from Bill Gates who said something to the effect that a closed system can work, but only with Jobs at the helm. I think Apple without Steve Jobs isn't nearly as good. I don't think that's because Tim Cook isn't an asshole though. It's because what Steve Jobs had was vision, and good taste for design. Not to mention amazing showmanship. I just don't like his products. But Apple fans are legion, and for good reason.The Open vs. Closed debate rages on. Both sides have their merits. First it was Apple and Microsoft, now Apple and Google. I'm firmly on the open side, but understand why the closed side is so popular/successful.Now it feels like innovation has largely stalled as companies are trying to push several technologies (I'm looking at you Smart Watches) that no one seems to really want or care about, and releasing only minor upgrades in hardware and software every year, rather than doing anything groundbreaking. I just hope Apple can start innovating again soon, because we can use the competition again.Steve Jobs was a complicated person. I'm thankful for his contributions to technology. I'm also thankful I never knew him.

Since his death in October, those of us who use Apple products and/or have a strong interest in technology have read various obituaries, tributes in blogs, and reviews of the Isaacson book. Like other books by Isaacson I have read over the years, this book is beautifully written, very well documented, honest in its criticism and praise of Jobs, and really compelling. The end is of course very sad, no matter how you may have felt about Jobs as a human being. He was both a creative genius and a very difficult person to be around not only in the work environment, but with his own family and friends, and at the end, even his doctors and nurses. As a bonus, Isaacson also provides an excellent, well-documented, and honest description of the culture of Silicon Valley and the history of the rise, the fall, and the rise again of Apple. Having worked in Silicon Valley, I was able to have a front row seat to amazingly rapid and fascinating technological advances. I worked with very intelligent, creative, decent, incredibly hard-working people who lived in simple ranch houses and drove nondescript cars. We were never bored. We worked long hours. Eventually we may have even been rewarded financially. But there was another culture in Silicon Valley. There were the personalities, Jobs among them, who landed on the cover of Wired or Fortune. They would be interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS. Personalities such as Ellison at Oracle, Jim Clark at Silicon Graphics and Netscape, and Scott McNealy at Sun Microsystems, had very strong, notoriously difficult and demanding personalities and super inflated egos. They accumulated vast wealth. They fought with their neighbors over the height of their backyard fences. They built expensive yachts and travelled in custom designed private airplanes. Yes, some of them, such as Hewlett and Packard, or Andrew Grove at Intel, have made significant investments in philanthropic activities. Of course, Bill Gates seems now to be more respected for his global philanthropic activities than for his contributions to Microsoft Jobs personality in particular was very inconsistent, as though he possessed some sort of split personality. He and his family lived in a basic middle class neighborhood in Palo Alto (north of Apple headquarters in Cupertino). They had no security presence in their lives, unlike many. Yet Jobs regularly drove down 101 (a notoriously dangerous freeway) at 100 mph in his Mercedes AMG (a $100,000 car he replaced annually) with no license plates and, once arriving at work, deliberately parked across two handicapped spaces while declining the ‚Äústatus‚Äù of his own personal CEO parking space. When pulled over for speeding or for driving without plates, he would make an excuse to the officer, speed off again, miracuously arriving safely at his destination. Jobs read the Autobiography of a Yogi once a year and spent time at Buddhist retreats. However, these pursuits did not give him any sense of tranquillity. He could be brutal, extremely hyper-critical with his employees, his suppliers, distributors and ad agencies. He was a genius in directing the creation of remarkable technologies (Apple II, Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad,)frequently copying the work of researchers as Xerox Parc however. He founded the wildly successful Pixar Animation Studios with its long run producing blockbuster animated films. But, he made terribly wrong decisions about his own health. He dressed simply but had bizarre eating habits, eating nothing but carrot juice for months, going on fasts, and adamantly declining food that would assist in building up his immune system during his lengthy illness. I found his treatment of doctors and nurses to be outrageous, but it was very honestly conveyed to Isaacson by Jobs‚Äô wife, Laurene Powell, certain close friends, and even doctors. Waiting for death to take him, Jobs could not resist complaining about the design of his oxygen mask. What would Freud have thought? What type of behavior is this?The chapters on the design of the iPod, the MAC, and the Apple stores were fascinating and also indicative of the very demanding and obsessive nature of Jobs personality. I do appreciate the simplicity of Apple's products, the Zen-like design of devices such as the Macbook Pro and the white iPhone. However I feel guilty possessing them knowing they were produced in China in horrible sweatshop factories, such as Foxcomm, where workers have even committed suicide after working very long hours for very low wages and feeling completely hopeless of ever rising above these conditions.The corporate history of Apple is also told is a very readable and well-documented detail. His dealings with others, including executives at suppliers and distributors, tech journalists, and powerful CEO‚Äôs such as Eisner at Disney, are fascinating and provide insights into the egos behind the CEO culture. Also compelling are the background stories behind the first firing of Jobs after his fall-out with former Pepsi CEO John Scully, his failures (such as the LISA computer and the Next computer) his return and attempt to run the highly successful PIXAR Studios at the same time as he was re-energizing Apple, the controversy surrounding back-dated stock options, the secrecy surrounding his health issues, and his final months. Jobs and his team created many highly successful products. But the failures were also given their fair share of treatment. What I‚Äôm left with most is a feeling of sadness for his family, his three daughters, his wife, his son, and his sister, Mona Simpson. As his wife, Laurene Powell, discussed at the end of the book (pages 543 ‚Äì 544), ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not extraordinary in every realm‚Äù. His family was neglected, especially his daughters, even as he must have realized he was going to have only a few short months left in this world. Laurene admits to Isaacson that Steve ‚Äúdid not have social graces, such as putting himself in other people‚Äôs shoes.‚Äù I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how emotionally drained Laurene especially must feel as she recovers from the ordeal of caring for her husband during this prolonged illness. After months in denial and avoiding treatment he finally accepted various medical treatments but also insisted upon trying bizarre so-called approaches that may have served to only make his condition worse. I wonder to what degree his angry, frenetic behavior, his anger, his constant need to always be in control of everything may have contributed to the development of the cancer that ultimately killed him. What was missing from the book was a deeper look at the manufacturing processes behind the iPad, iPhone and other Apple products. I don‚Äôt fault Isaacson for this. There simply could not have been time for him to thoroughly research the issues. These can be examined in another book on the subject. China has closed these factories, such as the notorious Foxcomm, to outside visitors. Before complaining about the high price of Apple and other tech products, we should all think of the low wage Chinese factory workers who are suffering serious damage to their health and well-being, even risking their lives, putting together the products we covet. Perhaps the new management at Apple will finally address these and other social welfare issues. Overall, Apple‚Äôs products have provided great benefit to so many around the globe. Do such products have to orginate with people possessing such difficult, abusive personalities?

Quotes from Steve Jobs

‚ÄúOne way to remember who you are is to remember who your heroes are.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you‚Äôve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, ‚ÄúBye. I have to go. I‚Äôm going crazy and I‚Äôm getting out of here.‚Äù And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently. (Steve Jobs)‚Äù

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
