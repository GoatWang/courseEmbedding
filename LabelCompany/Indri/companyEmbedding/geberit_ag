New Geberit products 2017











Geberit’s new or next-generation products must first meet an extensive list of requirements before they are released on the market. At the top of the list are quality and functionality, closely followed by design and ease of installation. Every Geberit product is backed by the knowledge and experience of numerous teams and accredited specialists from various disciplines.The market-specific product range can be found on the individual country pages. Geberit in your country




















Geberit AquaClean Tuma shower toiletThe shower toilet AquaClean Tuma impresses thanks to its elaborate product concept and simple, elegant design. It is available both as a WC complete solution with a rimless WC ceramic appliance and as a WC enhancement solution that can be combined with already installed ceramic appliances. The AquaClean Tuma offers a range of functions such as WhirlSpray shower technology, odour extraction, warm-air dryer and an ergonomically designed, heatable WC seat.













Roof drainage system Geberit PluviaThe well proven roof drainage system for large and very large roofs works according to the principle of negative pressure. It requires fewer outlets, pipes with smaller dimensions and fewer stacks than a conventional roof drainage system. The two most widely installed roof outlets in Europe with a discharge rate of 12 and 25 litres/second have been completely redesigned. They now have a more compact design and are easier to install. At the same time, the entire Pluvia range has been streamlined.













Shower surface SetaplanoThe Geberit Setaplano shower surface is designed for floor-even showers and is made of a high-quality solid surface material which has a smooth and warm feel and is non-slip even when wet. As many components are pre-assembled at the factory, among them the sealing foil, the time required for installation is reduced considerably. This shower surface is suitable for both new buildings and renovations.













Bathroom series AcantoThe Acanto bathroom series comprises everything that a modern bathroom has to offer nowadays: Washbasins in different sizes, rimless WC ceramic appliances, acrylic bathtubs as well as mirror cabinets, tall cabinets, washbasin cabinets and much more. The furniture elements are made from moisture-resistant materials and can be individually combined. They are highly functional and offer a lot of storage space.













Supply system Geberit VolexThe new Geberit Volex supply system combines two well established, proven and economic technologies: multilayer pipes and press connections. Volex offers a number of nifty improvements and is suitable for drinking water supply systems as well as radiator and underfloor heating systems. In addition to the multilayer pipes, Geberit also offers flexible single-layer pipes made from plastic.













Geberit tap systemElectronic washbasin taps for public sanitary facilities can be slim and elegant, yet still robust and safe to use. With the exception of the infrared sensor, all the electronic components as well as the mixer, valves and power supply are housed in a function box that is installed in the prewall in an easily accessible position underneath the washbasin. The modular tap system impresses thanks to its attractive price-performance ratio.

History[edit]




Geberit headquarters.


The Beginnings[edit]
In 1874, Caspar Melchior Gebert started a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[5] In 1905, he began to manufacture parts. His toilet tank, the Phoenix, a first, made of lead-coated wood and with lead fittings (particularly a flushing mechanism), was revolutionary and a great success. When Gebert died in 1909 his sons Albert and Leo took over the business. In the following years, the company expanded within Switzerland as well as to neighboring countries, and added new products (pipes, taps and valves). In the 1930s, the company was a pioneer of plastic parts in the sanitary industry.[6][7]
The Second World War affected the company, but it soon recovered and in 1952 introduced the first all-plastic toilet tank made of polyethylene.[8]
Expansion[edit]
In 1953, Heinrich and Klaus Gebert inherited control of the company and named it Geberit. The company opened a distribution subsidiary and new branches in Europe, which, besides parts, also offered technical services. As Germany was considered a growth market, the first international subsidiary was opened there in 1955, in Pfullendorf, which was also going to be the site of the first factory outside Switzerland. Since then, a number of subsidiaries were created in European countries, including France (1959) and Austria (1965). The company moved from Rapperswil to a larger facility in Rapperswil-Jona and introduced a concealed tank system.
In the 1970s, Geberit introduced more new products, such as full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and new components for the hygiene sector. A third plant was opened in 1972 in Pottenbrunn/Sankt Pölten, Austria. The company also created subsidiaries in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. The company made an attempt to enter the American market, creating a subsidiary in Michigan, Indiana. However, the U.S. presence remained insignificant for years.
In 1977, the company entered the installation systems market, which went on to become the most important market of the company. In 1980, the German facilities were expanded and a warehouse complex was opened at its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters. It also acquired a big German player in the installation-elements market, Sanbloc. In 1986, it began automating its production. In 1989, it acquired a stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, joining the fresh water supply systems sector.
In 1990, the facilities of Pottenbrunn were expanded. In 1994, a new plant was established in Lichtenstein in Eastern Germany to take advantage of the new markets after the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the Gebert family withdrew from managing the company and the first outsider was appointed CEO of the company: Gunter F. Kelm.[6] The company continued its expansion, with new facilities in Rapperswil-Jona, a factory for its Mepla brand in Givisiez, and new international subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.
In 1995, the Geberts sold Geberit to the British private equity firm Doughty Hanson.[6][9] With the new cash, the company started a series of acquisitions, which included Italy's Deriplast and Walking Pipe Italiana, Germany's Buchler Werkzeugbau AG and the United Kingdom's Caradon Terrain Ltd. In 1998, the company opened its first production plant in China.[8] In June 1999, Geberit was listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange.[5] In July 1999, it raised its stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001.
In 2001, the company suffered from the weakness of the German market, but soon recovered. In 2002, it acquired a majority stake in the Austrian company Huter Vorfertigung GmbH.[8] In July of that year, with the aim of strengthen its position in the American market, it purchased Chicago Faucet at a cost of 33.3 million dollars.[10]
In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012. In 2015, Geberit acquired the Finland-based bath and toilet firm Sanitec for $1.4 billion.[12]
Strategy[edit]
The company manufactures and sells its products mainly under the Geberit brand, although some subsidiaries' brands are also used. It has operations in more than 41 countries.[1][4]
Geberit’s strategy rests on four pillars: focus on sanitary technology, commitment to innovation, selective geographic expansion and continuous business process optimization.
For a number of years now, Geberit has been pursuing the three-stage sales model and the push-pull strategy. More specifically, Geberit products are distributed wholesale, with the company training over 100,000 plumbers and decision-makers a year at its 25 training centers around the world or at external training courses.
To date, Geberit has received a range of awards for the company’s innovative strength, product design and its strong focus on sustainability.[13]
Product areas[edit]
Sanitary systems[edit]
The sanitary systems area includes installation systems, cisterns, faucets and flushing systems, waste fittings and traps.[1][4]
Piping systems[edit]
This includes piping inside and outside of buildings. Product lines are building-drainage systems and supply systems.[1][4]
Bathroom ceramics[edit]
This encompasses toiled bowls, washbasins and other complementary products like furniture, showers and bathtubs.

In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012. In 2015, Geberit acquired the Finland-based bath and toilet firm Sanitec for $1.4 billion.[12]
Strategy[edit]
The company manufactures and sells its products mainly under the Geberit brand, although some subsidiaries' brands are also used. It has operations in more than 41 countries.[1][4]
Geberit’s strategy rests on four pillars: focus on sanitary technology, commitment to innovation, selective geographic expansion and continuous business process optimization.
For a number of years now, Geberit has been pursuing the three-stage sales model and the push-pull strategy. More specifically, Geberit products are distributed wholesale, with the company training over 100,000 plumbers and decision-makers a year at its 25 training centers around the world or at external training courses.
To date, Geberit has received a range of awards for the company’s innovative strength, product design and its strong focus on sustainability.[13]
Product areas[edit]
Sanitary systems[edit]
The sanitary systems area includes installation systems, cisterns, faucets and flushing systems, waste fittings and traps.[1][4]
Piping systems[edit]
This includes piping inside and outside of buildings. Product lines are building-drainage systems and supply systems.[1][4]
Bathroom ceramics[edit]
This encompasses toiled bowls, washbasins and other complementary products like furniture, showers and bathtubs.

History[edit]




Geberit headquarters.


The Beginnings[edit]
In 1874, Caspar Melchior Gebert started a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[5] In 1905, he began to manufacture parts. His toilet tank, the Phoenix, a first, made of lead-coated wood and with lead fittings (particularly a flushing mechanism), was revolutionary and a great success. When Gebert died in 1909 his sons Albert and Leo took over the business. In the following years, the company expanded within Switzerland as well as to neighboring countries, and added new products (pipes, taps and valves). In the 1930s, the company was a pioneer of plastic parts in the sanitary industry.[6][7]
The Second World War affected the company, but it soon recovered and in 1952 introduced the first all-plastic toilet tank made of polyethylene.[8]
Expansion[edit]
In 1953, Heinrich and Klaus Gebert inherited control of the company and named it Geberit. The company opened a distribution subsidiary and new branches in Europe, which, besides parts, also offered technical services. As Germany was considered a growth market, the first international subsidiary was opened there in 1955, in Pfullendorf, which was also going to be the site of the first factory outside Switzerland. Since then, a number of subsidiaries were created in European countries, including France (1959) and Austria (1965). The company moved from Rapperswil to a larger facility in Rapperswil-Jona and introduced a concealed tank system.
In the 1970s, Geberit introduced more new products, such as full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and new components for the hygiene sector. A third plant was opened in 1972 in Pottenbrunn/Sankt Pölten, Austria. The company also created subsidiaries in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. The company made an attempt to enter the American market, creating a subsidiary in Michigan, Indiana. However, the U.S. presence remained insignificant for years.
In 1977, the company entered the installation systems market, which went on to become the most important market of the company. In 1980, the German facilities were expanded and a warehouse complex was opened at its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters. It also acquired a big German player in the installation-elements market, Sanbloc. In 1986, it began automating its production. In 1989, it acquired a stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, joining the fresh water supply systems sector.
In 1990, the facilities of Pottenbrunn were expanded. In 1994, a new plant was established in Lichtenstein in Eastern Germany to take advantage of the new markets after the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the Gebert family withdrew from managing the company and the first outsider was appointed CEO of the company: Gunter F. Kelm.[6] The company continued its expansion, with new facilities in Rapperswil-Jona, a factory for its Mepla brand in Givisiez, and new international subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.
In 1995, the Geberts sold Geberit to the British private equity firm Doughty Hanson.[6][9] With the new cash, the company started a series of acquisitions, which included Italy's Deriplast and Walking Pipe Italiana, Germany's Buchler Werkzeugbau AG and the United Kingdom's Caradon Terrain Ltd. In 1998, the company opened its first production plant in China.[8] In June 1999, Geberit was listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange.[5] In July 1999, it raised its stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001.
In 2001, the company suffered from the weakness of the German market, but soon recovered. In 2002, it acquired a majority stake in the Austrian company Huter Vorfertigung GmbH.[8] In July of that year, with the aim of strengthen its position in the American market, it purchased Chicago Faucet at a cost of 33.3 million dollars.[10]
In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012.

Company History: 
Geberit AG is Europe's leading manufacturer of sanitary technology. The Jona, Switzerland-based company covers every aspect of sanitation systems and components, with products covering the entire range of building sanitation needs, from water supply to wastewater drainage. The company's products are developed along eight primary groups, divided into two major sectors. Under Sanitary Systems, which accounts for nearly 62 percent of Geberit's sales, the company's products include: Installation Systems; Flushing Systems, including water-saving technologies such as dual-volume and flush/stop systems; Public products and systems for public restroom facilities; Waste Fittings and Traps, for restrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens; Sanitary Products, including the company's "shower toilets," outfitted with bidet-like spray systems. Installation Systems represents the largest single Sanitary Systems market, with more than 37 percent of the company's total sales. Under the Piping Systems category Geberit includes: Building Drainage Systems, with complete piping and fittings assemblies for new construction and building renovations, which represents 20 percent of total group sales; Water Supply Systems; and Underground Piping Systems, which include products and systems for water and gas supply, sewage, drainage, and irrigation. Geberit operates in more than 70 countries worldwide, with eight manufacturing plants in Switzerland, Germany, the United States, Austria, Liechtenstein, Italy, Portugal, and China. Germany represents Geberit's single largest market, at 35.5 percent of sales in 2001. Italy, at 16.4 percent, and Switzerland, at 13 percent, are also major markets for the company, while the United Kingdom, Austria, the Benelux countries, and France account for nearly 24 percent of sales. Other markets, including North America, Asia, and the Middle East, added 11.5 percent to the company's sales of SFr 1.16 billion in 2001. In 2002, however, Geberit stepped up its presence in the United States, with the acquisition of The Chicago Faucet Company. Geberit's decentralized management structure typically places operational responsibility on the managers of its subsidiaries, which enables the company to remain reactive to local markets. Geberit also maintains a strong portfolio of brand names, including Hansgrohe, Balena, Geberit, Prosan, and others. Long a family-owned company, Geberit went public in 1999 on the Swiss Stock Exchange. 
Sanitary Technology Pioneer at the Dawn of the 20th Century 
Caspar Melchior Gebert started out as a plumber in Rapperswil, Switzerland, receiving a trade permit in 1874. Through the end of the century, Gebert built up his plumbing business. At the dawn of the 20th century, however, Gebert decided to enter manufacturing as well, and in 1905 began producing toilet tanks. Gebert's first tank, called the "Phoenix," was built of wood and lined with lead, and also featured a lead flush mechanism. The tank system represented somewhat of a breakthrough in the development of modern sanitary systems and the company was awarded a patent on the design in 1912. Gebert himself was not to live to see that event; upon his death in 1909, the company was taken over by his sons Albert and Leo. 
By the end of that decade, Gebert had developed markets for the company's tanks across Switzerland, as well as throughout much of the region. Gebert set up a number of production workshops in order to supply these foreign markets. Production levels began to grow again as World War I drew to a close, prompting the company to build a new production plant in Rapperswil, in 1917. The new facility included the company's own foundry. The following year, the company added a new range of products, including u-bend pipes and taps and valves, which also were used by the chemicals industry. 
In 1921, the company centralized all of its manufacturing activity into the single facility in Rapperswil. The company continued to develop its foreign markets, particularly in the German-speaking countries. By the end of the 1920s, however, the Gebert family extended the company's reach into France, with the opening of a sales office in Paris in 1929. 
The company continued to develop its product lines and in the mid-1930s the company once again placed itself at the forefront of sanitary technology. The development of plastic was to take its place among the most significant events of the 20th century, transforming nearly every aspect of people's lives. In 1935, the Gebert family company became one of the first to begin adapting the new plastic material to its toilet tank and piping systems. The noncorroding nature of the new material made it ideally suited for use in producing certain components for toilet systems, particularly in the concealed systems being developed for public facilities. 
World War II placed a halt on the company's growth. By the 1950s, however, with much of Europe undergoing a vast reconstruction and a corresponding economic boom, the company returned to its position as innovators in sanitary technology. In 1952, the company debuted its first all-plastic Geberit toilet tank. That product, produced with the newly developed polyethylene plastic, marked a new success for the company. 
International Growth in the 1950s 
The next generation of Geberts, brothers Heinrich and Klaus, took over management of the family-owned company in 1953. At that time, the company registered the Geberit trademark and adopted the slightly modified word as the new company name. Geberit then began to expand its European interests, creating a new international distribution subsidiary and opening new foreign offices offering sales and technical services. 
Germany represented the market with the largest growth potential, particularly given the vast rebuilding effort needed in the postwar years. In order to position itself in the German market, Geberit created its first foreign subsidiary in 1955 in Pfullendorf, which constructed its own production plant and began developing a dedicated network of sales and technical service offices across Germany. 
In addition to pursuing the foreign market, Geberit eyed an expansion of its product line. The flexibility of the new generation of plastics enabled the company to begin developing complementary product ranges, starting with Geberit's first drainage systems products, including u-bends and odor traps and related components, in 1956. 
Geberit launched a new foreign subsidiary in France in 1959, which was followed by the establishment of a subsidiary in Vienna, Austria, in 1965. By then the company had moved to a larger plant in Rapperswil-Jona, constructed in 1962 to meet the growing demand. In 1964, the company marked a new successful product launch when it introduced its first concealed tank system that year. 
Geberit's growth was particularly strong in Germany, and in 1967 the company built a new manufacturing facility for its Pfullendorf subsidiary. The company expanded its Jona plant and, in particular, added blow-molding production technology, reducing the cost of its toilet tank production. In 1972 Geberit added a third production plant, in Potterbrunn outside of Vienna. In that year, Geberit moved into a new market with the addition of a subsidiary in Belgium. A subsidiary was formed in The Netherlands in 1973. 
During the 1970s, Geberit continued to add new product categories, extending its product range to include full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and introducing new components for the hygiene sector. The company remained wholly focused on Europe until the mid-1970s. In 1976, however, Geberit made its first attempt to enter the U.S. market, launching a subsidiary and production plant in Michigan City, Indiana, in 1976. The United States was to remain a relatively minor market for Geberit, however. 
Sanitary Technology Leader in the New Century 
A more significant event for the company came with its move into the installation systems market in 1977. That product market became the company's single largest, accounting for more than one-third of its sales at the dawn of the 21st century. At the same time, Geberit began developing a range of other products, such as the so-called "shower toilet," which featured a bidet-like spray attachment for standard and custom-built toilets. 
The 1980s saw continued growth for the company. Geberit expanded its Pfullendorf plant again in 1980, while opening a warehouse facility at its Rapperswil-Jona site that same year. In 1984, Geberit moved into the Scandinavian market with the opening of a subsidiary in Denmark. A major step forward in the company's growing installation systems business came with the acquisition of Sanbloc GmbH, a producer of components for installation systems based in Weilheim, Germany. 
The company automated its production process in 1987. In 1989, Geberit moved into new product territories, specifically with an entry into the fresh water supply systems sector, a move accomplished in part by the acquisition of a shareholding in FAE Fluid Air Energy, which gave the company the exclusive license for marketing FAE's products. 
The company built a new, larger factory in Potterbrunn, which opened in 1990. Another production plant, placed under the company's Pretec subsidiary, was added in Liechtenstein in 1994, in order to take advantage of the newly opening markets in the eastern region of the reunified Germany as well as other Eastern European markets. By then, the company had begun to prepare its transition to a public company. In 1991, the company hired its first CEO from outside the Gebert family. Under Gunter F. Kelm, the company redeveloped its management structure, adopting a decentralized structure that gave its subsidiary greater operation control and responsibility. By 1992, the company's sales had topped SFr 785 million--a near-doubling of the company's revenues in just four years. 
Geberit continued to invest heavily, at an average rate of some SFr 80 million per year. The company opened a new production plant in its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters, and then constructed a plant for its Mepla product range in Givisiez, Switzerland. At the same time, Geberit acquired additional production capacity in Italy and Portugal. In 1994, Geberit launched a new subsidiary, Balena, as the brand for its line of toilet-showers. The company successfully developed the brand and its product line, topping 100,000 customers by the end of the decade. 
In the mid-1990s, Geberit began investigating its options for the future, and in 1995 the company announced that it was considering a public offering to enable the founding family to cash out of the business. Instead, Geberit was sold to British investment house Doughty Handson, manager of the largest private equity investment fund in Europe, in 1995. Gunter Kelm and the rest of Geberit's management team remained in place, acquiring a minority share in the company, which projected a public offering for later in the decade. 
With stronger financial backing, Geberit began a series of acquisitions, such as that of Italian PVC-pipe manufacturer Deriplast, acquired in 1995. The following year the company, through Deriplast, acquired another Italian company, Walking Pipe Italiana. In 1996, also, Geberit acquired Buchler Werkzeugbau AG, of Germany. Then, at the beginning of 1999, the company moved into the United Kingdom with the purchase of Caradon Terrain Ltd., a maker of drainage systems and other products under the Terrain brand name. Not all of the company's expansion moves came through acquisition, however; in 1998, the company prepared its drive into the Asian markets with the opening of a production plant in China. 
By the end of 1998, with sales topping SFr 1 billion for the first time, Doughty Hanson announced its intention to launch Geberit--now named Geberit AG--as a public company in 1999. That listing was accomplished in June 1999. 
The successful initial public offering gave Geberit the funds to pursue new acquisitions. In July 1999, the company acquired a further stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, raising its shareholding position to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001. 
Geberit was hit hard by a slumping German building sector in 2001, which saw the company's sales drop slightly. Yet Geberit hit back the following year with two key acquisitions. The first, made on January 1, 2002, gave the company a controlling stake of Austria's Firma Huter Vorfertigung GmbH, a company established in the 1970s specializing in installation systems. Then, in July 2002, Geberit strengthened its position in the North American market with the acquisition of The Chicago Faucet Company. The purchase of that company extended Geberit's product range to include commercial faucets and fittings, as well as four new production plants in the United States. Long established as a European sanitary technologies leader, Geberit prepared to extend its leadership to a global level in the new century.

History[edit]




Geberit headquarters.


The Beginnings[edit]
In 1874, Caspar Melchior Gebert started a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[5] In 1905, he began to manufacture parts. His toilet tank, the Phoenix, a first, made of lead-coated wood and with lead fittings (particularly a flushing mechanism), was revolutionary and a great success. When Gebert died in 1909 his sons Albert and Leo took over the business. In the following years, the company expanded within Switzerland as well as to neighboring countries, and added new products (pipes, taps and valves). In the 1930s, the company was a pioneer of plastic parts in the sanitary industry.[6][7]
The Second World War affected the company, but it soon recovered and in 1952 introduced the first all-plastic toilet tank made of polyethylene.[8]
Expansion[edit]
In 1953, Heinrich and Klaus Gebert inherited control of the company and named it Geberit. The company opened a distribution subsidiary and new branches in Europe, which, besides parts, also offered technical services. As Germany was considered a growth market, the first international subsidiary was opened there in 1955, in Pfullendorf, which was also going to be the site of the first factory outside Switzerland. Since then, a number of subsidiaries were created in European countries, including France (1959) and Austria (1965). The company moved from Rapperswil to a larger facility in Rapperswil-Jona and introduced a concealed tank system.
In the 1970s, Geberit introduced more new products, such as full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and new components for the hygiene sector. A third plant was opened in 1972 in Pottenbrunn/Sankt Pölten, Austria. The company also created subsidiaries in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. The company made an attempt to enter the American market, creating a subsidiary in Michigan, Indiana. However, the U.S. presence remained insignificant for years.
In 1977, the company entered the installation systems market, which went on to become the most important market of the company. In 1980, the German facilities were expanded and a warehouse complex was opened at its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters. It also acquired a big German player in the installation-elements market, Sanbloc. In 1986, it began automating its production. In 1989, it acquired a stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, joining the fresh water supply systems sector.
In 1990, the facilities of Pottenbrunn were expanded. In 1994, a new plant was established in Lichtenstein in Eastern Germany to take advantage of the new markets after the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the Gebert family withdrew from managing the company and the first outsider was appointed CEO of the company: Gunter F. Kelm.[6] The company continued its expansion, with new facilities in Rapperswil-Jona, a factory for its Mepla brand in Givisiez, and new international subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.
In 1995, the Geberts sold Geberit to the British private equity firm Doughty Hanson.[6][9] With the new cash, the company started a series of acquisitions, which included Italy's Deriplast and Walking Pipe Italiana, Germany's Buchler Werkzeugbau AG and the United Kingdom's Caradon Terrain Ltd. In 1998, the company opened its first production plant in China.[8] In June 1999, Geberit was listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange.[5] In July 1999, it raised its stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001.
In 2001, the company suffered from the weakness of the German market, but soon recovered. In 2002, it acquired a majority stake in the Austrian company Huter Vorfertigung GmbH.[8] In July of that year, with the aim of strengthen its position in the American market, it purchased Chicago Faucet at a cost of 33.3 million dollars.[10]
In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012. In 2015, Geberit acquired the Finland-based bath and toilet firm Sanitec for $1.4 billion.[12]
Strategy[edit]
The company manufactures and sells its products mainly under the Geberit brand, although some subsidiaries' brands are also used. It has operations in more than 41 countries.[1][4]
Geberit’s strategy rests on four pillars: focus on sanitary technology, commitment to innovation, selective geographic expansion and continuous business process optimization.
For a number of years now, Geberit has been pursuing the three-stage sales model and the push-pull strategy. More specifically, Geberit products are distributed wholesale, with the company training over 100,000 plumbers and decision-makers a year at its 25 training centers around the world or at external training courses.
To date, Geberit has received a range of awards for the company’s innovative strength, product design and its strong focus on sustainability.[13]
Product areas[edit]
Sanitary systems[edit]
The sanitary systems area includes installation systems, cisterns, faucets and flushing systems, waste fittings and traps.[1][4]
Piping systems[edit]
This includes piping inside and outside of buildings. Product lines are building-drainage systems and supply systems.[1][4]
Bathroom ceramics[edit]
This encompasses toiled bowls, washbasins and other complementary products like furniture, showers and bathtubs.

History[edit]




Geberit headquarters.


The Beginnings[edit]
In 1874, Caspar Melchior Gebert started a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[5] In 1905, he began to manufacture parts. His toilet tank, the Phoenix, a first, made of lead-coated wood and with lead fittings (particularly a flushing mechanism), was revolutionary and a great success. When Gebert died in 1909 his sons Albert and Leo took over the business. In the following years, the company expanded within Switzerland as well as to neighboring countries, and added new products (pipes, taps and valves). In the 1930s, the company was a pioneer of plastic parts in the sanitary industry.[6][7]
The Second World War affected the company, but it soon recovered and in 1952 introduced the first all-plastic toilet tank made of polyethylene.[8]
Expansion[edit]
In 1953, Heinrich and Klaus Gebert inherited control of the company and named it Geberit. The company opened a distribution subsidiary and new branches in Europe, which, besides parts, also offered technical services. As Germany was considered a growth market, the first international subsidiary was opened there in 1955, in Pfullendorf, which was also going to be the site of the first factory outside Switzerland. Since then, a number of subsidiaries were created in European countries, including France (1959) and Austria (1965). The company moved from Rapperswil to a larger facility in Rapperswil-Jona and introduced a concealed tank system.
In the 1970s, Geberit introduced more new products, such as full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and new components for the hygiene sector. A third plant was opened in 1972 in Pottenbrunn/Sankt Pölten, Austria. The company also created subsidiaries in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. The company made an attempt to enter the American market, creating a subsidiary in Michigan, Indiana. However, the U.S. presence remained insignificant for years.
In 1977, the company entered the installation systems market, which went on to become the most important market of the company. In 1980, the German facilities were expanded and a warehouse complex was opened at its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters. It also acquired a big German player in the installation-elements market, Sanbloc. In 1986, it began automating its production. In 1989, it acquired a stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, joining the fresh water supply systems sector.
In 1990, the facilities of Pottenbrunn were expanded. In 1994, a new plant was established in Lichtenstein in Eastern Germany to take advantage of the new markets after the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the Gebert family withdrew from managing the company and the first outsider was appointed CEO of the company: Gunter F. Kelm.[6] The company continued its expansion, with new facilities in Rapperswil-Jona, a factory for its Mepla brand in Givisiez, and new international subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.
In 1995, the Geberts sold Geberit to the British private equity firm Doughty Hanson.[6][9] With the new cash, the company started a series of acquisitions, which included Italy's Deriplast and Walking Pipe Italiana, Germany's Buchler Werkzeugbau AG and the United Kingdom's Caradon Terrain Ltd. In 1998, the company opened its first production plant in China.[8] In June 1999, Geberit was listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange.[5] In July 1999, it raised its stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001.
In 2001, the company suffered from the weakness of the German market, but soon recovered. In 2002, it acquired a majority stake in the Austrian company Huter Vorfertigung GmbH.[8] In July of that year, with the aim of strengthen its position in the American market, it purchased Chicago Faucet at a cost of 33.3 million dollars.[10]
In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012. In 2015, Geberit acquired the Finland-based bath and toilet firm Sanitec for $1.4 billion.[12]
Strategy[edit]
The company manufactures and sells its products mainly under the Geberit brand, although some subsidiaries' brands are also used. It has operations in more than 41 countries.[1][4]
Geberit’s strategy rests on four pillars: focus on sanitary technology, commitment to innovation, selective geographic expansion and continuous business process optimization.
For a number of years now, Geberit has been pursuing the three-stage sales model and the push-pull strategy. More specifically, Geberit products are distributed wholesale, with the company training over 100,000 plumbers and decision-makers a year at its 25 training centers around the world or at external training courses.
To date, Geberit has received a range of awards for the company’s innovative strength, product design and its strong focus on sustainability.[13]
Product areas[edit]
Sanitary systems[edit]
The sanitary systems area includes installation systems, cisterns, faucets and flushing systems, waste fittings and traps.[1][4]
Piping systems[edit]
This includes piping inside and outside of buildings. Product lines are building-drainage systems and supply systems.[1][4]
Bathroom ceramics[edit]
This encompasses toiled bowls, washbasins and other complementary products like furniture, showers and bathtubs.

History[edit]




Geberit headquarters.


The Beginnings[edit]
In 1874, Caspar Melchior Gebert started a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[5] In 1905, he began to manufacture parts. His toilet tank, the Phoenix, a first, made of lead-coated wood and with lead fittings (particularly a flushing mechanism), was revolutionary and a great success. When Gebert died in 1909 his sons Albert and Leo took over the business. In the following years, the company expanded within Switzerland as well as to neighboring countries, and added new products (pipes, taps and valves). In the 1930s, the company was a pioneer of plastic parts in the sanitary industry.[6][7]
The Second World War affected the company, but it soon recovered and in 1952 introduced the first all-plastic toilet tank made of polyethylene.[8]
Expansion[edit]
In 1953, Heinrich and Klaus Gebert inherited control of the company and named it Geberit. The company opened a distribution subsidiary and new branches in Europe, which, besides parts, also offered technical services. As Germany was considered a growth market, the first international subsidiary was opened there in 1955, in Pfullendorf, which was also going to be the site of the first factory outside Switzerland. Since then, a number of subsidiaries were created in European countries, including France (1959) and Austria (1965). The company moved from Rapperswil to a larger facility in Rapperswil-Jona and introduced a concealed tank system.
In the 1970s, Geberit introduced more new products, such as full drainage systems, flush-mounted systems, and new components for the hygiene sector. A third plant was opened in 1972 in Pottenbrunn/Sankt Pölten, Austria. The company also created subsidiaries in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. The company made an attempt to enter the American market, creating a subsidiary in Michigan, Indiana. However, the U.S. presence remained insignificant for years.
In 1977, the company entered the installation systems market, which went on to become the most important market of the company. In 1980, the German facilities were expanded and a warehouse complex was opened at its Rapperswil-Jona headquarters. It also acquired a big German player in the installation-elements market, Sanbloc. In 1986, it began automating its production. In 1989, it acquired a stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy, joining the fresh water supply systems sector.
In 1990, the facilities of Pottenbrunn were expanded. In 1994, a new plant was established in Lichtenstein in Eastern Germany to take advantage of the new markets after the end of the Cold War. In 1991, the Gebert family withdrew from managing the company and the first outsider was appointed CEO of the company: Gunter F. Kelm.[6] The company continued its expansion, with new facilities in Rapperswil-Jona, a factory for its Mepla brand in Givisiez, and new international subsidiaries in Italy and Portugal.
In 1995, the Geberts sold Geberit to the British private equity firm Doughty Hanson.[6][9] With the new cash, the company started a series of acquisitions, which included Italy's Deriplast and Walking Pipe Italiana, Germany's Buchler Werkzeugbau AG and the United Kingdom's Caradon Terrain Ltd. In 1998, the company opened its first production plant in China.[8] In June 1999, Geberit was listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange.[5] In July 1999, it raised its stake in FAE Fluid Air Energy to 70 percent, with an agreement to take full control of FAE by 2001.
In 2001, the company suffered from the weakness of the German market, but soon recovered. In 2002, it acquired a majority stake in the Austrian company Huter Vorfertigung GmbH.[8] In July of that year, with the aim of strengthen its position in the American market, it purchased Chicago Faucet at a cost of 33.3 million dollars.[10]
In 2004, it purchased the leading German metal pipe manufacturer Mapress Holding from Lindsay Goldberg & Bessemer at a cost of 372.5 million euros.[11] The Geberit share was included in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in 2012. In 2015, Geberit acquired the Finland-based bath and toilet firm Sanitec for $1.4 billion.[12]
Strategy[edit]
The company manufactures and sells its products mainly under the Geberit brand, although some subsidiaries' brands are also used. It has operations in more than 41 countries.[1][4]
Geberit’s strategy rests on four pillars: focus on sanitary technology, commitment to innovation, selective geographic expansion and continuous business process optimization.
For a number of years now, Geberit has been pursuing the three-stage sales model and the push-pull strategy. More specifically, Geberit products are distributed wholesale, with the company training over 100,000 plumbers and decision-makers a year at its 25 training centers around the world or at external training courses.
To date, Geberit has received a range of awards for the company’s innovative strength, product design and its strong focus on sustainability.[13]
Product areas[edit]
Sanitary systems[edit]
The sanitary systems area includes installation systems, cisterns, faucets and flushing systems, waste fittings and traps.[1][4]
Piping systems[edit]
This includes piping inside and outside of buildings. Product lines are building-drainage systems and supply systems.[1][4]
Bathroom ceramics[edit]
This encompasses toiled bowls, washbasins and other complementary products like furniture, showers and bathtubs.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
