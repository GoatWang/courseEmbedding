Sustainable Development Investments 
“We invest in solutions that contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These investments meet our financial risk and return requirements and support the generation of positive social and/or environmental impact through their products and services, or at times through acknowledged transformational leadership. We distinguish between investments where impact has and those where it has not been measured, and stimulate the latter to report on measurable impacts.” Download the taxonomies about how we do this.


APG Groep N.V. 2016 Annual Report
In general, 2016 was an eventful year with a number
of global developments such as Brexit, the Ukraine
referendum in the Netherlands and the presidential
election in the United States. 
The pension markets were in flux. Throughout the year, APG actively participated in a constructive dialogue on a
new pension system, in which the topics of transparency,
freedom of choice, and risk sharing were high
on the agenda.


Brochure Pension in progress
Governing a pension fund is an important responsibility. Your participants and stakeholders are counting on meticulousness, transparency and good performance throughout the years. Good and bad times alike.With APG you build a solid foundation for your pension administration.




Responsible Investment Report 2015

Dutch pension system and solidarity pension

We concur with our clients: we believe in the power of the Dutch pension system. Making collective agreements on a solidarity basis and proportionally distributing the costs and risks affords millions of Dutch people higher financial security on retirement.










Dutch pension system and solidarity pension

Solidarity between co-workers and generations is the power of the pension system. The costs and risks are shared by a large group. Our ambition is to support this system with our knowledge and expertise. We actively assist in developing its innovation, ensuring that the system continues to benefit future generations, for example by supporting four professorships.
APG is a pension provider organizing the pensions for 4.5 million people on behalf of its clients. For our clients, we provide the retirement plans of one in every five families in the Netherlands. A responsible task that we are aware of every day. In everything we do, we keep our final goal in mind: realizing a good and affordable pension at a reasonable rate for as many people as possible. Now and in the future.

Pension funds and participants are central

Our mission as a pension asset manager
Your pension fund and your participants are central in our thoughts and actions. We make a maximum effort to invest the pension assets available in a responsible and cost-effective way.










Pension funds and participants are central

Our missi​on is:
"We are investors of pension money. Our clients and their participants are at the forefront of our thoughts and actions. We use all of our experience, expertise and innovative power to invest the pension premiums in a sound, responsible and cost effective way.
We contribute to a high quality and affordable pension for the participants of our clients, by realizing a stable, long term return on investment, while taking measured and controlled risks.
To help achieve a sustainable world, is an inherent part of our investment process.”

Employer Services offers more

Above statutory minimum benefit schemes, redundancy pay, General Pensions (Holders of Political Office) Act (APPA), reintegration obligations: all of these things are the employer’s responsibility.










Employer Services offers more

And rightly so. However, that does not mean that you need to free up your own people and resources for this specialized work. APG’s clear recommendations and punctual administration provide you with the peace of mind and space needed to focus on your core business. We alleviate you from any concerns across the full breadth of the administrative services. Including effective information and feedback, enabling you to assume your responsibility without any concerns.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
