 https://lnkd...William likedSummaryWilliam is a human behaviour, innovation and technology addict. This social butterfly can be found at many meetups, movie nights and the odd Global Jam of design thinking. He is known for immersing and swimming in the world human behaviours and deep diving into the latest topic… , even if there is a book club on it! His journey has taken him deep into the world of meteorology, (Bureau of Meteorology) health behaviour change (Quit Victoria, Heart Foundation, Vic Health), Real Estate (REA, Ray White, realcommercial.com.au) Sport (Cricket Australia, AFL), Cars (Mazda), banking, retail and many others. Will’s passion extends beyond the 9-5 where the social butterfly becomes active, presents and creates all round havoc locally and internationally. Whether it is facilitating workshops, Global Service and Sustainability Jams or speaking on innovation in product and service design especially the future of digital where he loves working with teams to discover new ideas and opportunities. Also, he is your ‘crash test dummy’ for a new product or service. From following the ‘I Quit Sugar’ (#IQS) program to empathise health behaviour change to purchasing new cars, to his wife’s dismay when she realised it was only for research (UPDATE: she got the car) all with the aim to discover what it is like to live in someone else’s shoes.Here is a snapshot of past activities facilitating design thinking methods and service design workshops across Australia and Internationally. With Hub Melbourne, Ideas for Melbourne with Adam Bandt, the Victoria-India Service Design Jam for the Victoria State of Design Festival, the Edge of the Web Conference & Aust. Web Industry Association and of course the globally connecting Global Service, Sustainability and Gov Jams.SkillsCustomer ExperienceProduct DevelopmentInnovationService DesignUser ExperienceWeb DevelopmentRapid PrototypingConcept IdeationBehavior DesignPersuasionJavaScriptHTML + CSSInteraction DesignMobileDesignsSee 31+Usability TestingWorkshop FacilitationUser Centred DesignUsabilityUser-centered DesignSocial MediaDesign ThinkingMobile DevicesStrategyCMSWireframesInformation ArchitectureProject ManagementSEOHTMLUser ResearchUser Interface DesignAgile MethodologiesDigital StrategyInformation DesignManagementE-commerceUser Experience DesignWeb DesignUser InterfaceBusiness StrategyDigital MarketingEntrepreneurshipLeadershipOnline MarketingSocial Media MarketingSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!ExperienceOnline UX ManagerMYOBApril 2017  –  Present (4 months)Melbourne, AustraliaCustomer Experience Practice LeadAPD.January 2016  –  April 2017 (1 year 4 months)APD is a full-service digital agency that provides strategic advice, technical development and delivery of performance-based marketing strategies to solve business problems, develop technical solutions and improve the customer acquisition and engagement strategies.As the lead of the Customer Experience Practice, I am responsible for the delivery of creative approaches that address a business' challenges and develop the services and strategies that positively impact the whole customer experience.

We bring people together from various disciplines to improvise (Jam!) ideas, using Play, Service Design tools and Design Thinking. Jams provide safe, experiential learning environments that cultivate an active approach to problem solving. Jams are hands on and require participants to take ideas to concept and prototype stages. This rapid testing and iteration provides an understanding of the value of simple, cheap prototypes for the validation of ideas. Jam Melboure is a non-profit collaboration between service designers, innovators and entrepreneurs in Melbourne who co-design, co-create and curate the Melbourne Chapter of these events yearly global events. http://planet.globalservicejam.org/Team members: William Donovan, Murali Maheswaran, Fabio Oliveira, Carl Turner, Janine Sisson, Simon LawryVictoria India Service Design JamJuly 2011  –  July 2011First Victoria India Service design Jam, Exhibition Buildings CarltonDesign VictoriaTeam members: William Donovan, Janine Sisson, Mark Watson MDIA, Lee Ryan, Alice Howard-VyseVictoria India Service Design JamJuly 2011  –  July 2011First Victoria India Service design Jam, Exhibition Buildings CarltonDesign VictoriaTeam members: William Donovan, Janine Sisson, Mark Watson MDIA, Lee RyanMelbourne Global Service Jam 2013Starting November 2012The Global Service Jam is an event that occurs over the same weekend in over 100 cities across the globe.

He is an absolute LEGEND! Will just loves rapid prototyping and service design and he's been kind enough to run three service design workshops with me. Each time, the participants got an incredible amount out of it. 

The last one started at 6PM after the participants had already spent a whole day training. They were completely ZONKED, falling asleep at their tables and only sitting there because I forced them to:P Within 5 minutes of Will arriving, they were WIRED. His energy is infectious. In only a 2 hour workshop, he taught them the rudiments of service design and then helped them to collaboratively generate service plans for six different projects. 

Afterwards the feedback was that this workshop had helped them gain clarity on their projects for the first time in ages. They'd been feeling stuck: many of them had spent months planning what they would do, and they were not much closer to implementing anything than before they began. But through Will's workshop, they began to see with crystal clarity, what they could start doing now. They were lifted out of analysis paralysis and into action. 

Will encouraged them to think in different ways to what they were used to. If they were hyperactive normally (like me), he asked them to lay down and meditate. If they were quiet, contemplative types, he got them to walk up and down the stairs while talking about their ideas.

Will's workshop stirred up so much creative energy, that it was a wonder the building didn't set on fire!

If you ever want to get your team charged up, living their vision and coming up with creative solutions to problems that have stumped them for years, bring in Will Donovan. His superhero name is Mr Electricity - everything he touches gets BZZZED! (But don't worry, he won't zap you! He's the nicest guy around)See moreSee lessWilliam's personality shines through in his first class approach to client projects.

 William Donovan, the Office of Strategic Services, and Catholic Intelligence Sources during World War II
      
      

Michael Graziano


From:  
          U.S. Catholic HistorianVolume 33, Number 4, Fall 2015

          pp. 79-103 | 10.1353/cht.2015.0030



Abstract
Abstract:
	The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), an American intelligence agency during World War II, demonstrates the changing nature of anti-Catholicism within the American national security state during and after the war. Led by the Catholic lawyer, soldier, and politician William J. Donovan (1883−1959), the OSS eagerly sought to utilize Catholic individuals, ideas, and institutions as part of the war effort. The OSS worked with prominent Catholic leaders at home and abroad in an attempt to both guide Catholic perceptions of the war and leverage Catholic institutions as sources of strategic information. Somewhat paradoxically, the OSS and Donovan were interested in this information at least in part because of anti-Catholic assumptions then prevalent within the defense community and broader American culture. These anti-Catholic ideas shaped American intelligence operations during World War II and inadvertently increased demand for Catholic and other minority religious expertise within the post-war American intelligence system. The OSS’s success in working with Catholic institutions, including the Holy See, helped convince American defense and intelligence leaders of the strategic necessity of religious toleration and contributed to the growing pluralist discourse within the domestic United States.

 https://lnkd...William likedSummaryWilliam is a human behaviour, innovation and technology addict. This social butterfly can be found at many meetups, movie nights and the odd Global Jam of design thinking. He is known for immersing and swimming in the world human behaviours and deep diving into the latest topic… , even if there is a book club on it! His journey has taken him deep into the world of meteorology, (Bureau of Meteorology) health behaviour change (Quit Victoria, Heart Foundation, Vic Health), Real Estate (REA, Ray White, realcommercial.com.au) Sport (Cricket Australia, AFL), Cars (Mazda), banking, retail and many others. Will’s passion extends beyond the 9-5 where the social butterfly becomes active, presents and creates all round havoc locally and internationally. Whether it is facilitating workshops, Global Service and Sustainability Jams or speaking on innovation in product and service design especially the future of digital where he loves working with teams to discover new ideas and opportunities. Also, he is your ‘crash test dummy’ for a new product or service. From following the ‘I Quit Sugar’ (#IQS) program to empathise health behaviour change to purchasing new cars, to his wife’s dismay when she realised it was only for research (UPDATE: she got the car) all with the aim to discover what it is like to live in someone else’s shoes.Here is a snapshot of past activities facilitating design thinking methods and service design workshops across Australia and Internationally. With Hub Melbourne, Ideas for Melbourne with Adam Bandt, the Victoria-India Service Design Jam for the Victoria State of Design Festival, the Edge of the Web Conference & Aust.

We bring people together from various disciplines to improvise (Jam!) ideas, using Play, Service Design tools and Design Thinking. Jams provide safe, experiential learning environments that cultivate an active approach to problem solving. Jams are hands on and require participants to take ideas to concept and prototype stages. This rapid testing and iteration provides an understanding of the value of simple, cheap prototypes for the validation of ideas.

He is an absolute LEGEND! Will just loves rapid prototyping and service design and he's been kind enough to run three service design workshops with me. Each time, the participants got an incredible amount out of it. 

The last one started at 6PM after the participants had already spent a whole day training. They were completely ZONKED, falling asleep at their tables and only sitting there because I forced them to:P Within 5 minutes of Will arriving, they were WIRED. His energy is infectious. In only a 2 hour workshop, he taught them the rudiments of service design and then helped them to collaboratively generate service plans for six different projects. 

Afterwards the feedback was that this workshop had helped them gain clarity on their projects for the first time in ages. They'd been feeling stuck: many of them had spent months planning what they would do, and they were not much closer to implementing anything than before they began. But through Will's workshop, they began to see with crystal clarity, what they could start doing now. They were lifted out of analysis paralysis and into action. 

Will encouraged them to think in different ways to what they were used to. If they were hyperactive normally (like me), he asked them to lay down and meditate. If they were quiet, contemplative types, he got them to walk up and down the stairs while talking about their ideas.

Will's workshop stirred up so much creative energy, that it was a wonder the building didn't set on fire!

If you ever want to get your team charged up, living their vision and coming up with creative solutions to problems that have stumped them for years, bring in Will Donovan. His superhero name is Mr Electricity - everything he touches gets BZZZED! (But don't worry, he won't zap you! He's the nicest guy around)See moreSee lessWilliam's personality shines through in his first class approach to client projects.
