Avista Advantage Acquisition of TelAssess Bolsters Product Offering
Company strengthens commitment to telecom expense management

SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 10 // -- Avista Advantage, a subsidiary of Avista Corp. (NYSE: AVA), has acquired telecom consulting firm TelAssess, Inc. as a part of its ongoing expansion into the telecom expense management (TEM) service market.
(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20040128/SFW031LOGO )
Enhancing service and product offerings is primary among Avista Advantage's corporate initiatives, leading to the acquisition of a successful telecom expense management company with expertise in telecom network design, inventory control, contract negotiation and RFPs, as well as TEM solutions and audits. The acquisition of TelAssess enhances Avista Advantage's telecom service offering through advanced automation and tracking of audit functions, deeper analysis of long distance and data services, and the addition of wireless management. Much like its core utility service, Avista Advantage's telecom expense management services enable clients to proactively plan and better manage telecom costs, more easily identify areas for cost savings, and benefit from our reporting tools.
"It was a logical step to expand the company's success in utility expense management to the telecom arena," said Stu Stiles, Avista Advantage president and chief executive officer. "Avista Advantage, with the acquisition of TelAssess, now delivers a more expanded product set, enabling clients to operate their telecom departments with a higher level of information and increase their savings opportunities."
Avista Advantage has a client base of more than 350 of the largest organizations in America, representing over 160,000 locations nationally. Advantage continues to add to its customer base with an overall growth rate of 38 percent over the past year, including significant additions in the food service, entertainment and retail service sectors.
About Avista Advantage

Through process and pay, audit, reporting and consulting services, our patented technology and services provide multi- site companies with critical, yet easy-to-access information, enabling them to proactively manage and reduce facility-related expenses. Avista Advantage's patented Facility IQ™ System provides online access to consolidated costs as well as powerful analytical consulting services and real-time, flexible reporting tools.

NEW ORLEANS, July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Former Attorney General of Louisiana Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq. and the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC ("KSF") are investigating the proposed sale of Avista Corporation ("Avista" or the "Company") (NYSE:    AVA) to Hydro One Limited (TSX: H). Under the terms of the proposed transaction, shareholders of Avista will receive only $53.00 in cash for each share of Avista that they own. KSF is seeking to determine whether this consideration and the process that led to it are adequate, or whether the consideration undervalues the Company.








If you believe that this transaction undervalues the Company and/or if you would like to discuss your legal rights regarding the proposed sale, you may, without obligation or cost to you, e-mail or call KSF Managing Partner Lewis S. Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com) toll free at any time at 855-768-1857.

Avista Utilities is a U.S. energy company. Avista generates and transmits electricity and distributes natural gas, while providing energy solutions for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Approximately 1,550[citation needed] employees provides electricity, natural gas, and other energy services to 359,000 electric and 320,000 natural gas customers[citation needed] in three western states. The service territory covers 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2) in eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and parts of southern and eastern Oregon, with a population of 1.5 million.[2]
Avista Utilities is the regulated business unit of Avista Corp., an investor-owned corporation headquartered in Spokane, Washington. Avista Corp.'s primary, non-utility subsidiary was Ecova, an energy and sustainability management company with over 700[citation needed] expense management customers, representing more than 600,000[citation needed] sites. In 2014, Ecova was sold to Cofely, a subsidiary of GDF Suez.[3]
The company was founded in 1889[4] as Washington Water Power Company. The board of directors approved a name change to Avista Corporation, effective January 1, 1999. The company began trading under the Avista name on January 4, 1999.[5]
At that time, the company also bought naming rights for Spokane's minor league baseball park, Avista Stadium.

History[edit]
Washington Water Power was founded in 1889 helping the new and booming city of Spokane Falls to have more power. Using the Spokane River,[6][7] the idea was that the town could use water power. Trustees of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company asked for people to back them up in their project from New York to build a power station on the river. The people in New York refused saying that water power had little to no value. Defying the people in New York, 10 stockholders stepped up to support the project themselves and formed Washington Water Power to build it.[8]
Washington Water Power expanded in Oregon and into California by acquiring the natural gas operations of CP National from Alltel in 1989.[9] The California operations were sold to Southwest Gas in 2005.[10]
In 2014, Avista acquired Alaska Electric Light & Power, the electric utility for Juneau.[11]
In 2017, Ontario-based electrical utility Hydro One agreed to purchase Avista.[12]
Lawsuits[edit]
On September 27, 2002, Avista was sued for issuing false and misleading statements concerning its business and financial condition, including failing to disclose that Avista was engaged in highly risky energy trading activities with Enron and Portland General Electric.[13] On December 20, 2007, Avista agreed to a $9.5 million settlement.
Restatement[edit]
On February 20, 2002, the company had voluntarily adjusted the amount originally allocated to IPR&D and will restate its third quarter 1998 consolidated financial statements accordingly.[14]

The service territory covers 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2) in eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and parts of southern and eastern Oregon, with a population of 1.5 million.[2]
Avista Utilities is the regulated business unit of Avista Corp., an investor-owned corporation headquartered in Spokane, Washington. Avista Corp.'s primary, non-utility subsidiary was Ecova, an energy and sustainability management company with over 700[citation needed] expense management customers, representing more than 600,000[citation needed] sites. In 2014, Ecova was sold to Cofely, a subsidiary of GDF Suez.[3]
The company was founded in 1889[4] as Washington Water Power Company. The board of directors approved a name change to Avista Corporation, effective January 1, 1999. The company began trading under the Avista name on January 4, 1999.[5]
At that time, the company also bought naming rights for Spokane's minor league baseball park, Avista Stadium.

History[edit]
Washington Water Power was founded in 1889 helping the new and booming city of Spokane Falls to have more power. Using the Spokane River,[6][7] the idea was that the town could use water power. Trustees of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company asked for people to back them up in their project from New York to build a power station on the river. The people in New York refused saying that water power had little to no value. Defying the people in New York, 10 stockholders stepped up to support the project themselves and formed Washington Water Power to build it.[8]
Washington Water Power expanded in Oregon and into California by acquiring the natural gas operations of CP National from Alltel in 1989.[9] The California operations were sold to Southwest Gas in 2005.[10]
In 2014, Avista acquired Alaska Electric Light & Power, the electric utility for Juneau.[11]
In 2017, Ontario-based electrical utility Hydro One agreed to purchase Avista.[12]
Lawsuits[edit]
On September 27, 2002, Avista was sued for issuing false and misleading statements concerning its business and financial condition, including failing to disclose that Avista was engaged in highly risky energy trading activities with Enron and Portland General Electric.[13] On December 20, 2007, Avista agreed to a $9.5 million settlement.
Restatement[edit]
On February 20, 2002, the company had voluntarily adjusted the amount originally allocated to IPR&D and will restate its third quarter 1998 consolidated financial statements accordingly.[14]

Avista Utilities is a U.S. energy company. Avista generates and transmits electricity and distributes natural gas, while providing energy solutions for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Approximately 1,550[citation needed] employees provides electricity, natural gas, and other energy services to 359,000 electric and 320,000 natural gas customers[citation needed] in three western states. The service territory covers 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2) in eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and parts of southern and eastern Oregon, with a population of 1.5 million.[2]
Avista Utilities is the regulated business unit of Avista Corp., an investor-owned corporation headquartered in Spokane, Washington. Avista Corp.'s primary, non-utility subsidiary was Ecova, an energy and sustainability management company with over 700[citation needed] expense management customers, representing more than 600,000[citation needed] sites. In 2014, Ecova was sold to Cofely, a subsidiary of GDF Suez.[3]
The company was founded in 1889[4] as Washington Water Power Company. The board of directors approved a name change to Avista Corporation, effective January 1, 1999. The company began trading under the Avista name on January 4, 1999.[5]
At that time, the company also bought naming rights for Spokane's minor league baseball park, Avista Stadium.

History[edit]
Washington Water Power was founded in 1889 helping the new and booming city of Spokane Falls to have more power. Using the Spokane River,[6][7] the idea was that the town could use water power. Trustees of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company asked for people to back them up in their project from New York to build a power station on the river. The people in New York refused saying that water power had little to no value. Defying the people in New York, 10 stockholders stepped up to support the project themselves and formed Washington Water Power to build it.[8]
Washington Water Power expanded in Oregon and into California by acquiring the natural gas operations of CP National from Alltel in 1989.[9] The California operations were sold to Southwest Gas in 2005.[10]
In 2014, Avista acquired Alaska Electric Light & Power, the electric utility for Juneau.[11]
In 2017, Ontario-based electrical utility Hydro One agreed to purchase Avista.[12]
Lawsuits[edit]
On September 27, 2002, Avista was sued for issuing false and misleading statements concerning its business and financial condition, including failing to disclose that Avista was engaged in highly risky energy trading activities with Enron and Portland General Electric.[13] On December 20, 2007, Avista agreed to a $9.5 million settlement.
Restatement[edit]
On February 20, 2002, the company had voluntarily adjusted the amount originally allocated to IPR&D and will restate its third quarter 1998 consolidated financial statements accordingly.[14]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
