There are also special risk considerations associated with international and global investing (especially emerging markets), small and mid-capitalization companies, or other growth and/or concentrated investment strategies. 											
2.  DSM, located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, managing separate accounts, pooled investment vehicles and wrap accounts for both institutional and high net worth investors. 											
3.  DSM primarily manages equities in a model portfolio method and therefore presents a single Global Focus Growth composite return for managed accounts.  In general, the Global Focus Growth strategy will invest in equity securities of large and mid capitalization companies.  Equity securities, as determined by DSM in its discretion include, but are not limited to, common stocks, preferred stocks, securities convertible into common stocks, rights and warrants.  The Global Focus Growth strategy has no limit on the proportion of assets it can invest in the equity securities of domestic versus foreign companies.  The Global Focus Growth strategy will generally will contain 12 or fewer equity securities.  DSM historically purchased non-US securities (otherwise known as local shares) for this model investment strategy. As of March 31, 2017, clients may specifically authorized DSM to purchase American Depository Receipts or similar securities and accept that the price of American Depository Receipts and similar securities may materially differ from the price of the non-US securities (local shares).  The investment objective is to provide capital appreciation through investment in a concentrated portfolio. 											
4.  DSM claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards.  DSM has been independently verified for the periods January 2002 to December 2015. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards.  The Global Focus Growth composite has been examined for the periods July 2009 to December 2015. The verification and performance examination reports are available upon request. Benchmark returns are not covered by the report of independent verifiers.											
5.   DSM’s performance composite includes all discretionary Global Focus Growth managed accounts.  The composite was created July 1, 2009.  Policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request.  A complete list and description of composites is available upon request to Russell Katz, DSM Capital Partners, 7111 Fairway Drive, Suite 350, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33418.  Phone: 561-618-4000; email: rkatz@dsmcapital.com.											
6.   DSM first offered the Global Focus Growth strategy to clients during July of 2009.  There was one client account in the composite for the full period from 2009-2011.											
7.  Performance is presented in US Dollars.  Results are time-weighted and asset-weighted based on beginning-of-period asset values.  Valuation is on a trade-date basis.  Results include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.  Dividends are realized on an accrual basis; cash equivalent dividends are realized on a cash basis.  Composite returns are net of withholding taxes on foreign dividends.  As of March 2017, reclaimed withholding taxes are recognized as income when received.  Pre-fee results include the effect of commissions; post-fee results include the effect of commissions and management fees.  Custody charges, where applicable, are not deducted from gross and net-of-fee performance.  The 36-month annualized standard deviation measures the variability of the composite and the benchmark returns over the preceding 36-month period.  The 36-month standard deviation is not shown for periods comprising fewer than 36 monthly returns.  Dispersion between accounts is the asset-weighted standard deviation of gross returns for active accounts with DSM for the entirety of a given year.  Dispersion is only reported for years having five or more such accounts.  Additional information regarding policies for calculating and reporting returns is available upon request.											
8.   DSM’s management fee is generally 1.0% per annum on the assets.  DSM’s advisory fees are fully detailed in Part 2A of its Form ADV. This fee is charged quarterly in advance.  Certain accounts in the composite may have different fee structures (including performance fees) and certain accounts may involve non-fee expenses not included above.   The performance figures presented do not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees actually charged to the account in the composite.  Rather, the performance results presented reflect the deduction of a model advisory fee.  From inception of the composite on July 1, 2009, a model advisory fee of 1.0% per annum for Global Focus has been  used.  From inception through December 31, 2016 DSM calculated monthly post-fee performance by applying one-third of the quarterly model fee to each month of a quarter.  As of January 1, 2017, DSM calculates post-fee returns by deducting the entire quarterly model fee in the first month of the quarter, with no fee deduction in the second and third month of the quarter.  Quarterly post-fee returns based on beginning-of-quarter market values may compound to more or less than monthly post-fee returns based on beginning-of-month market values.   											
9.  The MSCI ACWI Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. The MSCI ACWI consists of 45 country indices comprising 24 developed and 21 emerging market country indices. This index includes dividends reinvested net of withholding taxes.  MSCI uses the withholding tax rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors that do not benefit from double taxation treaties.  DSM uses the MSCI ACWI Index as a benchmark because it is a global industry standard.  Characteristics of any benchmark may differ materially from accounts managed by DSM. The volatility of a benchmark may be materially different from the individual performance attained by a specific client investing within this strategy, and the holdings of the accounts contained within the composite may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the benchmark.  Indices are not assessed a management fee and investors cannot directly invest in an index.  In September of 2013, DSM retroactively changed the benchmark for the composite from the MSCI ACWI IMI Index to the MSCI ACWI Index.  The MSCI ACWI Index is more representative of the strategy’s market capitalization range. 											
10.  Leveraged accounts, if any, in the composite involve non-discretionary leverage only.  In such cases, per GIPS recommendations, the effect of leverage is removed by treating borrowing as a cash flow and adding back margin interest. 											
11.  There have been no material changes in the persons responsible for the investment management of the Global Focus Growth since its inception.

CINCINNATI, June 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Touchstone Advisors Inc. has entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of U.S. mutual funds managed by DSM Capital Partners LLC (DSM). As part of the agreement, Touchstone, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Financial Group, will acquire roughly $208 million in assets and add DSM as its newest sub-advisor.

The DSM Large Cap Growth Fund will be reorganized into the Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund. The DSM Global Growth Fund and the DSM Global Growth & Income Fund will be reorganized into the Touchstone Global Growth Fund. The new funds will adhere to similar investment goals and strategies, while retaining the investment team of DSM with Daniel Strickberger, co-managing partner and chief investment officer of DSM, as the portfolio manager. The reorganizations are contingent upon DSM shareholder approval.  
"We were determined to make this acquisition a reality because these funds offer expert management and strong, long-term performance records. The DSM investment team relies on extensive experience to combine intensive fundamental research with a rigorous valuation methodology to seek long-term returns with reduced risk," said Steven M. Graziano, president of Touchstone Investments. "The firm has also played a critical role in running actively managed, concentrated portfolios for investors and will boost our lineup of highly active strategies with holdings that are differentiated from their benchmarks."
The changes will include the creation of new share classes for the funds, which currently only offer an institutional share class. The reorganization, contingent upon shareholder approval, is expected to be completed later this summer.
"We look for companies with growing businesses, attractive returns, solid business fundamentals and intelligent management. We believe the research and stock selection process must be fast, flexible, and opportunistic," Strickberger said. "With this acquisition, our shareholders will gain access to Touchstone's larger distribution platform, which could lead to more growth opportunities, greater economies of scale and lower overall costs."
Touchstone Advisors had roughly $15.8 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2016.
