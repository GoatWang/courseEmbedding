Maximum loan amount: $417,000*The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is subject to change without notice. The APR is based upon an 80% loan-to-value ratio and a sample loan amount of $200,000. All loans are subject to application and approval. The monthly payment does not reflect amounts to be paid into escrow, such as insurance or taxes, and the actual payment obligation will be  greater. Property insurance is required. Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) are subject to rate changes after the loan has closed. The 5/1 ARM interest rate is subject to increase at the end of the 5-year fixed rate period. Your interest rate may be adjusted annually thereafter and will be based on an index plus a margin. The interest rate will be based on the weekly average yield of the United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of 1 year (your index), plus our margin. These rates depend on your individual credit history and specific loan transaction. The loan pricing (rate and points) may only be locked in by the mortgage department upon approval.

(1) All closing costs are waived on the condition that the Home Equity Line/Loan remains open for three years. (If the Bank attorneys require Title Insurance, you will pay the cost.)

All or part of the interest on a Home Equity Line/Loan may be tax deductible under the Tax Reform Law. We suggest you consult your tax advisor regarding the deductibility of the interest. Property insurance is required, which includes, if required, flood insurance.(2) Home Equity Line of Credit* NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY: The Home Equity Line for an 80% Loan to Value has an initial rate of 2.750% for 12 months, thereafter a variable rate with the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculated by adding 0% to the highest Prime Rate published by the Wall Street Journal.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. 

Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

Adirondack Trust Company



05/22/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 06/15/2017 03:42
The Adirondack Trust Company Announces New Student Checking Product








Saratoga Springs, New York...The Adirondack Trust Company announced today that it has launched ATC Free Student Checking, the newest deposit product designed to help students reach their financial goals and to help them manage their money while developing basic money management skills.


Charles V. Wait, Jr., Executive Vice President of The Adirondack Trust Company said, 'By opening an ATC Free Student Checking account, students will benefit from the ease and convenience of tracking their money that they have worked so hard to earn. Students will have immediate access to their account information and for example, will learn firsthand how to use an ATM or deposit a check.  At The Adirondack Trust Company we believe that by providing them the opportunity to learn about the basics of money at an early age, they will in turn become financially responsible adults.'


The ATC Free Student Checking account is available to individuals who are ages 13 through 23 and will require those under the age of 18 to have a parent/guardian listed on the account. The account is tailored to help keep track of their money anytime, anywhere by using the bank's WebWise Online Banking Services or the Mobile Banking app, as well as accessing their account at any Adirondack Trust branch and ATM. The account is structured so there are no minimum balance requirements, no monthly maintenance fee and a refund of up to (4) or $15 of non-ATC ATM surcharges monthly.

The Adirondack Trust Company is an independent, locally owned and operated, community bank offering a wide variety of business and personal financial services. The bank has more than $1 billion in assets and twelve branch offices. The bank offers banking, trust, insurance, and investment management services, and originates real estate mortgages, both residential and commercial, and commercial business loans throughout its primary market area. The bank is a Bauer 5 Star Rated Superior bank.  The bank's website is AdirondackTrust.com

Saratoga Springs, New York...The Adirondack Trust Company announced today that it has launched ATC Free Student Checking, the newest deposit product designed to help students reach their financial goals and to help them manage their money while developing basic money management skills.


Charles V. Wait, Jr., Executive Vice President of The Adirondack Trust Company said, 'By opening an ATC Free Student Checking account, students will benefit from the ease and convenience of tracking their money that they have worked so hard to earn. Students will have immediate access to their account information and for example, will learn firsthand how to use an ATM or deposit a check.  At The Adirondack Trust Company we believe that by providing them the opportunity to learn about the basics of money at an early age, they will in turn become financially responsible adults.'


The ATC Free Student Checking account is available to individuals who are ages 13 through 23 and will require those under the age of 18 to have a parent/guardian listed on the account. The account is tailored to help keep track of their money anytime, anywhere by using the bank's WebWise Online Banking Services or the Mobile Banking app, as well as accessing their account at any Adirondack Trust branch and ATM. The account is structured so there are no minimum balance requirements, no monthly maintenance fee and a refund of up to (4) or $15 of non-ATC ATM surcharges monthly.

The Adirondack Trust Company is an independent, locally owned and operated, community bank offering a wide variety of business and personal financial services. The bank has more than $1 billion in assets and twelve branch offices. The bank offers banking, trust, insurance, and investment management services, and originates real estate mortgages, both residential and commercial, and commercial business loans throughout its primary market area. The bank is a Bauer 5 Star Rated Superior bank.  The bank's website is AdirondackTrust.com

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. 

Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. 

Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. 

Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.

This is yet another satellite office for Adirondack Trust complete with friendly tellers. Compared, for example, to the one on Church Street, this one opens and closes earlier. 

Be a little careful pulling in here from the side streets (Brainard and Charof). There are quite a few cars pulling in and out, especially complicated by the heavy traffic at the intersection and folks going to Target, for example.
