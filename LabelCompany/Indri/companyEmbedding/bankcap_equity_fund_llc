Joseph M. (Jody) Grant, Chairman and Partner of BankCap Partners, has over 40 years of experience (principally in banking) and is Chairman Emeritus of Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (TCBI).  Prior to this, he served as Chairman and CEO of TCBI, positions he held since he founded the bank in 1998.  At the time, TCBI was believed to be the largest start-up in banking history.  From 1990 to 1998, Mr. Grant served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and a member of the board of directors of Electronic Data Systems (EDS).  From 1975 to 1989, Mr. Grant served in various positions at Texas American Bancshares, Inc., including Chairman and CEO from 1986 to 1989.  His book, The Great Texas Banking Crash – An Insider’s Account, documents the struggles during his time as Chairman and CEO at Texas American and the demise of banks in Texas in the late 1980s.
In December 2001, the American Banker named Mr. Grant “Community Banker of the Year,” a category including all banks in the U.S. of less than $10 billion.  In 2002, Ernst & Young named him “Entrepreneur of the Year” for the financial services sector, and SMU recognized him in 2003 with its Silver Anniversary Mustang Award.  In 2010, he was named a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award.  Mr. Grant is a 2011 Laureate of the Junior Achievement Dallas Business Hall of Fame.  He was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame in 2013 and currently serves on the board of the DCCCD Foundation.  Mr. Grant spearheaded the drive to create Klyde Warren Park, an urban park in Dallas and is the former Chairman of the Communities Foundation of Texas.
Mr. Grant has served as international president of Young Presidents’ Organization and has served on the boards of trustees of S.M.U. and T.C.U.  He has an undergraduate degree from S.M.U., where he was an All-American swimmer.  He received a Ph.D. in finance and economics from the University of Texas.  A San Antonio native, he and his wife Sheila reside in Dallas.
