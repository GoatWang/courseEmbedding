"Ive been using 
                                      the CEntrance Dacport for listen to music 
                                      when Im on the road. I really love 
                                      the warmth and depth of the sound. In fact, 
                                      I love it so much that Ive recently 
                                      put a DACmini in my recording studio as 
                                      a monitor controller and headphone amp. 
                                      The layout is fantastic and the converters 
                                      and headphone amp are second to none. What 
                                      a great product!"
