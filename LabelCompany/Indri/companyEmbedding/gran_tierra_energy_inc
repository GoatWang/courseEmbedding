About Us













Gran Tierra Energy Inc. together with its subsidiaries (“Gran Tierra”) is a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia.
The Company's common shares trade on the NYSE MKT, and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols GTE.
Gran Tierra believes in creating value for all of our stakeholders through oil and gas exploration and production, capitalizing on the global operating experience of our team. We are building a record of success in Colombia in a transparent, safe, secure and responsible way.
Strategy
During 2016, Gran Tierra successfully transformed its portfolio by delivering on our strategy of building a high-quality, diversified suite of assets in Colombia with high netback production, low base production declines, an expanded drilling inventory and a large resource base.
Now that we have transformed the portfolio, our focus is on execution. With our delivery of strong production growth in fourth quarter 2016, we are demonstrating that Gran Tierra has created a sustainable business model which we expect to be fully funded point-forward by forecasted cash from operating activities. Since we operate over 90% of our production, Gran Tierra also has significant control and flexibility on capital allocation and timing.

“We believe that our focused strategy is delivering results on several fronts and that Gran Tierra is well positioned for an exciting year of growth in 2017 and beyond as we efficiently create value in the multi-horizon, proven hydrocarbon producing basins of Colombia.”
Gary Guidry, President and CEO, March 2017

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: November 28, 2014

 The CEO of Gran Tierra Energy (GTE) had to prepare for an upcoming strategy session with senior executives. GTE's investments in Peru looked promising, as recent exploration well tests indicated large oil reserves with significant production potential that could transform the company. However, the company's Brazil operations continued to encounter challenges, such as setbacks in applying new technologies. The CEO had had high hopes when GTE entered Brazil in 2009 and thought that he and his team had carefully considered the risks. Given the increasingly positive developments in Peru, was dedicating the resources of GTE - a somewhat small energy firm by global standards - to Brazil operations still worth the risk? Could GTE turn the situation around or should the CEO recommend a divestment of the Brazilian assets? Birgitte Grøgaard is affiliated with University of Calgary.

Announces Sale of Brazil BusinessMarketwiredFebruary 6, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Feb 6, 2017) -  Gran Tierra Energy Inc. ("Gran Tierra" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT:GTE)(GTE.TO), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia, is pleased to announce that a purchase and sale agreement (the "Agreement") was executed pursuant to which Maha Energy AB ("Maha") has agreed to purchase Gran Tierra's Brazil business unit through the acquisition of all of the equity interests in one of Gran Tierra's indirect subsidiaries, and the assignment of certain debt owed by the corporate entities comprising Gran Tierra's Brazil business unit to the Gran Tierra group of companies (the "Brazil Divestiture").Upon completion of the Brazil Divestiture, Maha will acquire all of Gran Tierra's assets in Brazil, including its 100% working interest in the Tiê Field and all of Gran Tierra's interest in exploration rights and obligations held pursuant to concession agreements granted by the Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis of Brazil ("ANP").The completion of the Brazil Divesture is subject to Maha obtaining financing, as well as customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approval from the ANP. The consideration to be received by Gran Tierra on the completion of the Brazil divestiture is US$35 million, subject to adjustments, plus the assumption by Maha of certain existing and potential liabilities of Gran Tierra's Brazil business unit. Pursuant to the Agreement, Maha will pay a deposit US$3.5 million by February 9, 2017, which is not refundable in the event Maha is not successful in obtaining financing to complete the Brazil Divestiture.As previously disclosed, the Company's assets in Brazil are not considered core to Gran Tierra's Colombia growth strategy, and we believe this divestiture allows Gran Tierra a significant advantage by reallocating resources (people and money) to our core Colombian exploration, development and production operations.The economic effective date of the transaction will be on or before August 1, 2017, and Gran Tierra will continue to operate its Brazil business unit until the completion of the Brazil Divestiture.About Gran Tierra Energy Inc.Gran Tierra Energy Inc. is an international oil and gas exploration and production company, headquartered in Calgary, Canada, incorporated in the United States, trading on the NYSE MKT (GTE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (GTE), and operating in South America. Gran Tierra holds interests in producing and prospective properties in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. Gran Tierra has a strategy that focuses on establishing a portfolio of producing properties, plus production enhancement and exploration opportunities to provide a base for future growth. Additional information concerning Gran Tierra is available at www.grantierra.com. Investor inquiries may be directed to info@grantierra.com or (403) 265-3221.Gran Tierra's Securities and Exchange Commission filings are available on a website maintained by the Securities and Exchange Commission at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com.Forward Looking Statements and Legal Advisories:This press release contains opinions, forecasts, projections, and other statements about future events or results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and financial outlook and forward looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (collectively, "forward-looking statements"). The use of the words "will" and "believes", derivations thereof and similar terms identify forward-looking statements. In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, this news release contains forward-looking statements regarding: our ability to complete the Brazil Divestiture, the ability of Maha to raise the remainder of the funds required to complete the Brazil Divestiture; the anticipated benefits of the transaction to Gran Tierra Energy and its shareholders and the anticipated receipt of approvals for the Brazil Divestiture.The forward-looking statements contained in this news release are based on certain assumptions made by Gran Tierra based on management's experience and other factors believed to be appropriate. Gran Tierra Energy believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time, but the forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Gran Tierra's control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include the factors discussed or referenced in Gran Tierra's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, under the caption "Risk Factors" in Gran Tierra's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 29, 2016 and its subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These filings are available on a Web site maintained by the Securities and Exchange Commission at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.Read MoreAll forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable securities laws. Gran Tierra's forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBrazil sends 1,000 additional officers to combat Rio violenceAFPHavaianas: the flip-flops emblematic of Brazil -- corruption and allAFPTrump administration pulls health law help in 18 citiesAssociated PressShort-sellers have lost $7.1 billion betting against this year's hottest tech stocksYahoo FinanceOne month after Tim Tebow's ridiculed promotion, he is on fireBusiness InsiderAetna CEO Bertolini: How tech plays into the future of healthcareYahoo Finance VideoStocks back off from record highsYahoo FinanceI tried the 'Atkins on steroids' diet for 2 months — and it made me feel invincibleBusiness InsiderThe pizza-making robots that want to change the worldDavid PogueThe CIA director just dropped some heavy hints that the US is looking into regime change in North KoreaBusiness InsiderAetna CEO Bertolini: Why he pays his employees to sleepYahoo Finance VideoWhat Harlem thinks about Whole Foods coming to the neighborhoodYahoo Finance2 Dudes in a Car: Blissing out in the Lincoln ContinentalYahoo FinanceCBO: Under the latest Senate healthcare bill, deductibles could be more than some people earnBusiness InsiderGM may kill 6 car models as it works with UAW to tackle sales slumpAutoblogAetna CEO Bertolini: How his own accident and son’s cancer changed his journeyYahoo Finance VideoEx-CIA Director Hayden: Russia election meddling was ‘most successful covert operation in history’Sophie11Rose: We should take this as a warning.

Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Provides Operational UpdateHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Gran Tierra Energy Inc. Provides Operational UpdateMarketwiredMarch 1, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Mar 1, 2017) -  Gran Tierra Energy Inc. ("Gran Tierra" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT:GTE)(GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia, is pleased to provide today an operational update. All dollar amounts are in United States ("U.S.") dollars, unless otherwise indicated.Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, commented "2017 is off to an exciting start for Gran Tierra. We are pleased to report that the Acordionero field in the Middle Magdalena Basin continues to exceed our expectations and are encouraged by the discovery of a new and deeper 24 degree API gravity oil reservoir in the field, which we plan to effectively exploit using our existing infrastructure. We continue to see encouraging results with the A Limestone play in the Costayaco field in the Putumayo Basin, with a recent third recompletion in the field in the CYC-2 well producing at an initial rate of 2,023 barrel of oil per day ("bopd"). In the Putumayo-7 Block ("PUT-7"), the Confianza-1 exploration/appraisal well has encountered potential oil pay in three reservoirs, two of which would be new zones for this block. We believe that our focused strategy is delivering results on several fronts in Colombia. With our positive results from development drilling in Acordionero, our exciting new A Limestone play at Costayaco, and our high potential Putumayo N Sand and A Limestone exploration program, Gran Tierra is well positioned for potential growth in 2017 and beyond."Development Program UpdateAcordionero Field Development (Gran Tierra 100% Working Interest ("WI") and Operator)The AC-8i development well was spud on December 26, 2016 and drilled to a total depth of 10,340 feet ("ft") total measured depth ("MD") and 10,028 ft true vertical depth ("TVD"). This well is planned as a water injector in the Lisama A and C reservoirs as a pilot test for enhanced oil recovery. The well was drilled in the lowest structural position to date in the field, and crossed the oil-water contact ("OWC") in the Lisama A at a depth 143 feet deeper than the previous Lowest Known Oil depth ("LKO"). Petrophysical analysis of the AC-8i's well logs indicates that the Lisama C reservoir's 2P OWC was likely found at approximately the expected depth. The AC-8i was drilled below the Lisama C in order to appraise the lower part of the Lisama interval, and an oil-bearing Lisama D sand was found. A total of 8 ft of gross pay was perforated in the Lisama D sand for testing. Over a three day period, the well flowed naturally and produced 24 degree API oil at an average rate of 144 bopd and 0.2% water cut from only 8 feet of perforated pay. The test results for the Lisama D sand at AC-8i are positive since they indicate the existence of a previously untested reservoir at the deepest position in the reservoir that has been drilled to date. The AC-8i will be completed initially as a Lisama C injector. The initial waterflood pilot for Acordionero is forecasted to be onstream in early second quarter 2017.The AC-9 development well was spud on February 6, 2017 and reached 8,929 ft MD and 8,708 ft TVD on February 23, 2017 and completion operations began on the same day. The Lisama A sand was cored and 88 ft of core was recovered. Total cost to drill, core, complete and tie-in this well is forecasted to be $4.4 million, which the lowest cost to date in Acordionero. Based on logging while drilling ("LWD") data, the following potential net pays were identified: Lisama A (240 ft); Lisama C (140 ft); and Lisama D (19 ft). The completion plan for AC-9 is to start with the lowest productive interval and conduct a short term test of the Lisama D before completing the Lisama C and equipping with an electric submersible pump ("ESP").Based on petrophysical analysis of logs, the Lisama-D is also present in the AC-3 well with 13 ft of net pay and in the AC-4 well with 18 ft of net pay. Both of these wells were drilled by the previous operator, however they were not tested.The next well, AC-10, is designed to target reserves in the Lisama A and C reservoirs. This will be the first well in the next phase of the development targeting the northern portion of the field from a pad where the existing AC-2 well is located.Costayaco Field Development (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)CYC-2 was drilled in first quarter 2008 and was producing 247 bopd at a 95% water cut (approximately 4,750 barrels of water per day) from the Caballos and T Sands. Potential pay was identified in the A Limestone and M2 Limestone and a packer was set to temporarily isolate the active Caballos and T Sands. A 36-ft interval was perforated in the lower A Limestone, with no initial pressure or fluid flow response. The lower A Limestone interval was stimulated with acid, and a pump run to clean up the well. The well cleaned up and tested 2,023 bopd of 30 degree API oil, along with a low water cut of 1.1% over a 24 hour time period on February 25, 2017. Over the past 24 hours the production from the well has averaged 2,083 bopd with a water cut of 0.6%. CYC-2 is now the third well producing from the A Limestone formation in the Costayaco field. Production from the lower A Limestone interval will continue to be evaluated before making a decision to move uphole to perforate and stimulate an additional 18 feet of pay in the upper A Limestone, and 54 feet of pay in the M2 Limestone intervals.CYC-28 was spud on December 31, 2016 and will be the first horizontal well into the A Limestone. A pilot hole was successfully drilled into the A Limestone formation where 78 feet of core was recovered. The core showed extensive fracturing and strong oil shows including visible oil not only from the fractures but also the matrix structure of the rock. Extensive core analysis is currently underway to better understand the A Limestone throughout the Costayaco field and the Putumayo basin. While oil shows were found throughout the cored interval, a specific 25-ft interval has been identified as having the best fracture density and will be the targeted zone for the 1,000-meter horizontal leg. The well has been kicked off and was landed 8 feet below the top of the targeted 25-ft zone within the A Limestone as planned. Casing is currently being set and drilling will continue within the next couple of days.The two recompleted A Limestone wells, CYC-9 and CYC-19, continue to perform well and have produced an average of 527 and 1,587 bopd respectively (2017 year to date) of 30 degree API oil along with an average gas-oil ratio ("GOR") of 201 standard cubic feet per stock tank barrel ("scf/stb") and an average water cut of 0.9%.Water injection was a key focus throughout the second half of 2016 where injection volumes were increased by 33%. Several plans are in place to continue to increase injection volumes through 2017. By converting wells to injectors, stimulating existing injectors and adding pump capacity, injection volumes should increase by another 25% through the year to provide pressure support and optimize recoveries.Moqueta Field Development (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)With the previously reported increase in water injection into Moqueta, the overall GOR in this field has started to decrease and production has started to increase in a number of wells. In particular, MQT-12 production has increased by about 400 bopd since September of 2016 and is currently producing record high volumes for that well of around 1,000 bopd. We anticipate the trend to continue and therefore, we are not forecasting any oil production decline at Moqueta in 2017, with little capital requirements.On February 1, 2017, a total of 168 ft of pay was perforated across the A and M2 Limestones in the MQT-19 wellbore. The final completion string was run in the hole to allow for selective stimulations and testing of each zone. An 84 gallon/ft concentration of hydrochloric acid was used to stimulate both zones and although injectivity plots demonstrated that the acid was effective, the stimulation volumes may not have been large enough to effectively access the fractures within the reservoir. A higher volume acid stimulation of this well is currently being evaluated and will be performed in the first half of 2017.Exploration Program UpdatePutumayo 7 ("PUT-7") Block (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)Confianza-1 is the third exploration/appraisal well drilled within the Cumplidor-Alpha field within PUT-7. This well was located on amplitudes interpreted from two dimensional ("2D") seismic between the Cumplidor-1 and Alpha-1 wells. The well was spud on January 17, 2017. In addition to serving as an appraisal well for the N Sand of the Villeta formation discovered in Cumplidor-1 and Alpha-1, the well was planned to test deeper prospective horizons including the "A" Limestone and the "U" Sand of the Villeta formation. A final depth of 12,500 ft MD and of 10,118 ft TVD was reached in the Caballos formation on February 24, 2017.Based on well logs and oil show while drilling, the well has encountered interpreted oil pay in the U Sand (6 ft), the A Limestone (50 ft of gross interval with 15 ft of net pay), and the N Sand. The N Sand shows three potential reservoir intervals totaling 24 ft of net pay. The pay thickness encountered in the N Sand based on amplitudes from 2D seismic was as expected. Therefore, our confidence continues to build in the interpretation of seismic amplitudes as correlated to pay thickness.The Confianza-1 is a significant step out from current A Limestone production in the northern portion of the Putumayo Basin at Costayaco. Testing of all three interpreted zones (U Sand, N Sand and A Limestone) is planned to begin immediately with the drilling rig onsite. Information collected from this well could be helpful with the interpretation of the evolving basin-wide A Limestone play.The Cumplidor-1 well produced 19 degree API oil with a GOR of less than 100 scf/stb and a water cut of less than 1% at a rate of 236 to 1,403 bopd. A maximum instantaneous rate of 1,900 bopd was achieved just prior to jet pump failure. Progressively larger jet pump nozzles were run in the well, and the last attempt resulted in sticking a tool string and wireline in the well. The well is on the same pad as the Confianza-1 well, and a workover will be conducted once the testing on Confianza-1 is completed.Gran Tierra has obtained the regulatory approvals to acquire 95 square kilometers of three dimensional ("3D") seismic starting in late second quarter 2017 in two separate programs, over the Cumplidor field area and the N Sand prospects in the central area of PUT-7 called Pomorroso and Northwest. The seismic fulfills the contractual commitments for the block in this phase. Acquiring 43 square kilometers of 3D seismic over the Cumplidor-field area is expected to provide high quality amplitude information to optimize potential future development well locations and for future waterflooding of the field. The seismic project timing was sequenced to locate the exploration wells to be drilled to the west at Pomorroso and Northwest based on 3D seismic amplitudes. These exploration wells are expected to be drilled in fourth quarter 2017.Putumayo 4 ("PUT-4") Block (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)On December 30, 2016, the license was granted to drill the Siriri-1 exploration well which is planned to test both N Sand amplitudes on 2D seismic and the deeper A Limestone exploration play. Civil works are forecasted to start in early March 2017 for access road and lease construction.Putumayo 1 ("PUT-1") Block (Gran Tierra 55% WI and Operator)The Vonu-1 exploration well is expected to spud during second quarter 2017. The well is planned to be a directional drill with the pad located in the adjacent Chaza Block which contains the Costayaco and Moqueta fields. Civil works preparations are underway on the existing pad site within the Costayaco field and a contracted drilling rig is planned to be mobilized to this pad after civil works are completed.The Vonu-1 is planned to target an interpreted structural prospect, similar to the Costayaco field. It is a multi-zone prospect with potential in the Caballos formation, the Villeta U and T Sands, the A Limestone and the N Sand.Nancy-Burdine-Maxine ("NBM") BlockGran Tierra announced the acquisition of this block from Ecopetrol late fourth quarter 2016. This block is strategic for both its infrastructure and prospective resource potential. Existing drilling pads may be used to test some of the potential exploration upside in this new block.The planned near term exploration program calls for permitting, followed by acquisition of approximately 100 square kilometers of 3D seismic, permitting of three new drilling pad locations, and then the potential drilling of several multi-zone prospects. Similar to the northern Putumayo, Gran Tierra plans to explore for N Sand, A Limestone and deeper U, T, and Caballos Sands potential in this new block.Llanos - El Porton Block (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)The civil works for road access and pad construction have been completed for the Prosperidad-1 exploration well. The drilling rig has commenced mobilizing to the lease site. This well is planned to target a multi-zone structural exploration prospect with oil potential in the Mirador, Gacheta, and Une formations.Middle Magdalena Valley Basin - Acordionero Exploitation Area (Gran Tierra 100% WI and Operator)Progress is underway to obtain site access to drill the Totumillo-1 structural exploration prospect that is immediately south of the Acordionero field. The structural prospect is planned to target reservoirs of the Lisama Formation, as found in the Acordionero field. The prospect is within the Acordionero exploitation license, and the Totumillo-1 exploration well is planned to spud in the second quarter of 2017.Sinu-San Jacinto Basin - Sinu-Sinu-3 Block (Gran Tierra 51% WI and Operator)The recently acquired 2D seismic has been interpreted and a new prospect has been identified on this block called Tonga-1. An integrated scouting team is reviewing the existing environmental license for potential site access. The planned spud of this well is in late second quarter 2017.About Gran Tierra Energy Inc.Gran Tierra Energy Inc. is an international oil and gas exploration and production company, headquartered in Calgary, Canada, incorporated in the United States, trading on the NYSE MKT (GTE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (GTE), and operating in South America.

These filings are available on the Web site maintained by the Securities and Exchange Commission at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although the current capital spending program and long term strategy of Gran Tierra is based upon the current expectations of the management of Gran Tierra, should any one of a number of issues arise, Gran Tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and/or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed.All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable securities laws. Gran Tierra's forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.Estimates of future production may be considered to be future-oriented financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable Canadian securities laws. Financial outlook and future-oriented financial information contained in this press release about prospective financial performance, financial position or cash flows are based on assumptions about future events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on management's assessment of the relevant information currently available, and to become available in the future. In particular, this press release contains projected operational information for 2017. These projections contain forward-looking statements and are based on a number of material assumptions and factors set out above.

BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 barrel would be misleading as an indication of value.References to thickness of "oil pay" or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume. Well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. Well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery. If it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out, any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed.ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityTwitter Hack or Authentic?

Its asset portfolio includes stakes in blocks in the Marañón and Ucayali basins in Peru. In Brazil it has been involved in the Recôncavo and São Francisco basins. In Colombia, it has interests in 19 blocks and is the operator of 17, including Chaza, Guayuyaco, Llanos-22, Magdalena, Sierra Nevada, Santana, Piedemonte Sur and Putumayo. The company was incorporated in 2003, originally under the name Goldstrike Inc. After the acquisition of oil and gas producing and non-producing assets in 2005, Gran Tierra Energy became one of the major players carrying out exploration and drilling work in Peru, Brazil and Colombia. In 2014, the firm sold its interests in Argentina to fellow Canadian Madalena Energy for US$63mn in order to focus on Peru, Colombia and Brazil. In July 2015, its Santana contract in Colombia expired and all assets, staff and future liabilities were transferred to Ecopetrol. In January 2016, Gran Tierra completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Petroamerica Oil Corp., as part of the company's strategy to grow and diversify its portfolio and strengthen its position in the productive basins of Putumayo and Llanos, in Colombia. Currently, the company is evaluating exploration opportunities for a potential long-term development in Mexico.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
