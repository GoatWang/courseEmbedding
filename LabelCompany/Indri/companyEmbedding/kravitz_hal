LOS ANGELES, Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AQUAhydrate announced today that Hal Kravitz, a highly respected leader in the beverage industry formerly with the Coca-Cola Company, will assume the role as CEO of AQUAhydrate.   With over 30 years at Coke, Hal's achievements have spanned from running large regional operations on the bottling and distribution side of the business, to serving as Chief Revenue Officer, to most recently leading the Glaceau business unit, which includes Smartwater®, Vitaminwater®, Powerade®, and Fuze® post-Coca-Cola acquisition. 
Kravitz' new beginning rides the tail of great news for the AQUAhydrate business, as the brand has seen triple-digit growth at retail year-over-year since launch in 2012, quadrupling its size.  It has also recently achieved the status of the fastest growing water in the US according to AC Nielsen reporting, and is widely regarded as the leader in the alkaline water category.  Over the past twelve months, the company has significantly upgraded its sales organization and distribution network, and retailers recognize it as a very productive product offering amongst its peers.
Boasting investors Mark Wahlberg, Sean "Diddy" Combs, and The Yucaipa Companies, AQUAhydrate has pioneered a new category of Performance Lifestyle beverages, and was one of the first to introduce bottled alkaline water to the market.  Since its launch, the brand has garnered over 5 billion media impressions and become an icon for the Millennial generation of consumers.  Kravitz and AQUAhydrate's seasoned leadership team believe the brand is poised to transform the beverage category, as savvy consumers are switching away from high calorie artificial beverages and reverting back to quality performance-oriented drinking water.
"Hal's credentials and accomplishments have no comparison.  He is a seasoned executive that will add immense value to the already successful AQUAhydrate team.  I look forward to working closely with him to pioneer a new frontier in health and wellness," stated Wahlberg.   
"I strive to push and exceed boundaries, always aligning myself with the best and most talented individuals to take us to the top.  Hal's experience in building and growing innovative products and brands in the beverage category makes him uniquely qualified to take AQUAhydrate to the next level with today's new generation of consumers," said Combs.
Excited by the potential of AQUAhydrate, Kravitz states, "I believe that good-for-you products should be made available to everyone.  Leading AQUAhydrate gives me the opportunity to share a uniquely positioned product that addresses our consumers' growing need for healthy alternatives to aid their performance lifestyle.  Our commitment to quality, taste, and performance coupled with marketing assets that are unsurpassed will make AQUAhydrate a huge success with consumers in an already explosive category." 
ABOUT AQUAhydrateAQUAhydrate, Inc. is a Southern California-based performance lifestyle bottled water company geared towards the new generation of Millennial consumers.  Through a proprietary process, its water is purified to some of the most rigorous standards in the industry, supplemented with electrolytes and natural trace minerals and then raised to an alkaline pH of over 9. It is this powerful synergy between alkalinity, electrolytes and minerals which fuels ultimate hydration, balance and performance, and which has made AQUAhydrate the water of choice for myriad health/fitness authorities and professional athletes.  AQUAhydrate is proud to have Sean "Diddy" Combs and Mark Wahlberg as active investors and board members. AQUAhydrate is available at retail locations across the U.S. and at www.aquahydrate.com.  Follow on Facebook (facebook.com/AQUAhydrate) and Twitter (@AQUAhydrate).

Celsius Adds AQUAhydrate CEO Hal Kravitz to Board of Directors

Neil Martinez-Belkin May. 10, 2016 at 9:39 am

Celsius is showing no signs of slowing down its recent run of reputable additions to its senior leadership team. On Tuesday the functional beverage company announced that Hal Kravitz, CEO of high alkaline and enhanced water brand AQUAhydrate, has joined its board of directors.

In a press release, Celsius president and CEO Gerry David called Kravitz “an innovator within the beverage and consumer products industries”, adding that his experience “in beverage industry operations, business strategy and revenue management will be extremely valuable as Celsius continues to expand worldwide.”
A 30-year veteran of the Coca-Cola Company, Kravitz departed from his dual role as senior vice president of franchise and commercial operations for glaceau and director of customer governance in Coca-Cola North America’s franchise relations group in May of 2013. At the top of 2015 AQUAhydrate announced it had tapped Kravitz to lead the company as CEO.
Kravitz joining Celsius’ board of directors arrives as the latest in a string of additions to Celsius’ team. In January, the company announced the hire of former Lacroix executive Vanessa Walker as executive vice president of sales and marketing, as well as five new regional sales managers. Earlier this month the company brought on John McKillop, formerly of PepsiAmericas Beverages Company, Keurig, Javo Beverage, Core-Mark and Glanbia Performance, as national director of sales for the fitness channel.
The company’s full press release can be found below:
Boca Raton, FL (May 10, 2016) – Celsius Holdings, Inc. (OTCQX: CELH), the creator and marketer of Celsius®, the world’s first negative calorie drink, backed by clinical science, announced today the appointment of Hal Kravitz, Chief Executive Officer of AQUAhydrate, to Celsius’ board of directors. Kravitz brings a wealth of knowledge to the Celsius board, with extensive general management experience on both the brand owner and distribution sides of the beverage business including marketing and brand management, finance and revenue management, sales, and operations.
Before Kravitz joined AQUAhydrate as CEO in November 2014, he spent over 30 years as an officer and leader at Coca-Cola, earning credentials in general management, strategy and planning, operations, sales, marketing, business development and revenue management. After serving as President of The Glaceau Division, he successfully led the integration of the Division into Coca-Cola North America (a division of The Coca-Cola Company), Kravitz became Senior Vice President, Franchise and Commercial Operations for the Glacéau Division in August 2009, for brands including, Powerade®, Fuze®, Vitaminwater® and Smartwater®. In addition to his role as SVP at Glacéau, he simultaneously served as Director of Customer Governance in Coca-Cola North America’s Franchise Relations Group, where Kravitz worked with Coca-Cola Refreshments and the 69 independent Coca-Cola Bottlers on system alignment, customer management and go-to market strategy.
“In recent years, I have come to admire the Celsius brand for its innovative products and dynamic leadership team,” added Hal Kravitz. “I have a tremendous amount of respect for a brand that responds directly to consumer demand, especially within such a competitive industry. Celsius does just that, while continuing to exceed consumer and industry expectations. I am honored to be joining the Celsius board, and look forward to contributing to the company’s ongoing success.”
“Like Celsius, Kravitz is an innovator within the beverage and consumer products industries, and we’re thrilled to welcome him as a member of our board of directors,” said Gerry David, President and CEO of Celsius. “Especially during the midst of a tremendous growth period for our company, we believe his unmatched experience in beverage industry operations, business strategy and revenue management will be extremely valuable as Celsius continues to expand worldwide.”
Kravitz joins the existing board whose members include, William Milmoe, (CEO at CDS International Holdings), Tim Leissner (former Chairman Goldman Sachs, SE Asia), Kevin Harrington (SharkTank alumni and CPG Visionary), Nick Castaldo (former VP Marketing, Denny’s), Chris Lai (Horizon Ventures) and Thomas Lynch (Insurance Industry Executive).
Celsius is named for its correlating ability to raise heat production in the body, a process known as thermogenesis. Powered by a proprietary MetaPlus Blend® of ingredients, drinking Celsius will trigger the body’s ability to effectively burn fat and calories, accelerate metabolism, boost endurance and drive, while providing lasting energy.
