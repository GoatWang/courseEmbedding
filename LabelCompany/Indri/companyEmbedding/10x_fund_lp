Pro-Pharmaceuticals Closes $310,000 Tranche From 10X Fund






Business Wire




May 4, 2010 7:15 AM EDT













 


















































  Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: PRWP) (the “Company”), today announced that it has closed a $310,000 tranche of a private placement of up to $6.0 million with 10X Fund, L.P., which is purchasing unregistered Series B convertible preferred stock and warrants. This tranche brings the total raised to date from the 10X Fund to approximately $5.4 million.  At the 10X Fund closing, which occurred on April 30, 2010, the Company issued and sold 155,000 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock convertible into 620,000 shares of common stock, a Class A-1 and a Class A-2 warrant each exercisable to purchase 310,000 shares of common stock and a Class B warrant exercisable to purchase 1,240,000 shares of common stock, for a gross purchase price of $310,000. Net proceeds were approximately $297,000.  The Company expects to use the proceeds from the financing for the commercialization and development of its lead compound DAVANAT ®, as well as for general corporate purposes.  The Series B Preferred Stock, the Class A-1 Warrants, the Class A-2 Warrants and the Class B Warrants, including the common stock underlying the Series B Preferred Stock and warrants, have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  About DAVANAT  ®   DAVANAT ®, the Company's lead product candidate, is a polysaccharide polymer that targets Galectin receptors that are over-expressed on cancer cells. Peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated that Galectins affect cell development and play important roles in cancer, including tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, tumor metastasis and give the tumor the ability to evade the immune system. To date, DAVANAT ® has been administered to approximately 100 cancer patients. Data from a Phase II trial for end-stage colorectal cancer patients showed that DAVANAT ® in combination with 5-FU extended median survival to 6.7 months with reduced side effects, as compared to 4.6 months for best standard of care as determined by the patients’ physicians. These clinical trials also showed that patients experienced fewer serious adverse side effects of the chemotherapy and required less hospitalization.  Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Pro-Pharmaceuticals, OTCBB: PRWP, is a pioneer in the field of Galectin Therapeutics and is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic compounds that target Galectin receptors for advanced treatment of cancer and fibrosis. Initially, the product pipeline is focused on increasing the efficacy and decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs. The Company is headquartered in Newton, Mass. Additional information is available at www.pro-pharmaceuticals.com.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: Any statements in this news release about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, including without limitation statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. We caution investors that actual results or business conditions may differ materially from those projected or suggested in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, the following: uncertainties as to the utility and market for our potential products; uncertainties associated with pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates; and uncertainties as to the results of the financing. More information about those risks and uncertainties is contained in the Company’s most recent quarterly or annual report and in the Company’s other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events may cause the Company’s views to change, the Company disclaims any obligation to update such forward-looking statements.  DAVANAT is a registered trademark of Pro-Pharmaceuticals.

More Moneywhen it matters most



                    Our low fees and award-winning investment strategy mean more money for you at retirement.
                

Get the facts


⇣





10X Investments manages over R7bn in assets for industry-leading clients













Here’s how we get you more

                    No matter who you are or how much money you invest with us, we use one, simple investment strategy.
                    Why? Because it works. No confusing choices, no extra costs. Just four core principles proven to get
                    you more:
                









Index Tracking
It’s impossible to predict the market. Instead of trying to pick
                            winning stocks, we deliver the returns of the market as a whole, at a fraction of the
                            cost.







Low fees
Our total fees are less than half the industry average – and the
                            difference is invested on your behalf to compound over time.







Diversified Portfolio
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. We invest your money locally
                            and offshore, in a diversified portfolio of shares, property, bonds and cash.







Life Stage Investing
We automatically adjust your portfolio based on your retirement date. The result? Maximised returns and minimised risk. No difficult or costly decisions.

Low Fees

High fees can cost you 40% of your retirement


                        All 10X funds are index funds.
                        And because index funds don’t need expensive fund managers or the structures
                        needed to support them, we can charge you less than 1% in total fees excl. VAT.
                        The industry average is 3%. Paying that higher fee, compounded over time,
                        means you could end up with 40% less money at retirement.

Returns are based on R100 lump sum invested on 31 December 2007 to 30 November
                                2016.Source: 10X Investments, Alexander Forbes Large Manager Watch.




Superior Returns

If you invested R100 in 2007, would you rather have R202 or R257
                                today?


                            Our approach delivers superior long-term returns at a fraction of the cost. In fact, since
                            its inception in 2008, the 10X High Equity portfolio has consistently outperformed the
                            average return of large fund managers.* And over a forty-year working life, that can mean as
                            much as 60% more money at retirement.

Transparency

No hidden fees, no surprises.

                        language. You always know what you earn, what you pay, and where you are in relation to your
                        goals.

                                long term returns; and charge less
                                than 1% in total fees excl. VAT, maximising your savings at every turn.

10X calculator assumptions & disclaimers






Fees are the only difference between the “Industry” and 10X projections.
The fees used in the projections are inclusive of VAT. The investment referred to as “Industry” is assumed to charge total fees of 3% including VAT per annum. Morningstar’s Global Fund Investor Experience 2015 study shows that the average total expense ratio is 1.63% pa (which includes investment and performance fees), with the cost of advice and an administration platform adding an additional 1% to 1.5% pa. The investment with 10X assumes a total fee of 1% including VAT per annum and that the client comes directly to 10X (i.e. no advisor fee).  This is the maximum investment fee charged by 10X.
The calculator assumes the you save 10% of the salary you input and that this grows annually in line with inflation.
The investment term and savings period is assumed to be from your current age to age 65, unless you are over 55. If you are over 55 the investment term is assumed to be 20 years.
Your projected investment value is shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections are based on the 10X High Equity portfolio, which is designed for investors with an investment term of 5 years and longer. The portfolio may be highly volatile over shorter periods.
The projections do not account for tax in any way.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning. Although our projections take account of the historical returns earned in the South African and International markets, future market returns are uncertain. Past performance does not guarantee nor indicate future results.
The calculations provided should not be construed as financial, legal or tax advice. In addition, such information should not be relied upon as the only source of information. This information is supplied from sources we believe to be reliable but we cannot guarantee its accuracy.

Morningstar’s Global Fund Investor Experience 2015 study shows that the average total expense ratio is 1.63% pa (which includes investment and performance fees), with the cost of advice and an administration platform adding an additional 1% to 1.5% pa. The investment with 10X is assumed to charge a fee according to the 10X Living Annuity scale. The maximum fee in this scale is 0.86% including VAT per annum.
Your projected income and investment value are shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected income in the first year will be equal to your desired income provided your annual income is between the regulatory limits of 2.5% and 17.5% of your investment value. Each year your projected income will keep pace with inflation, provided that it falls within these regulatory limits. The number of years that your projected income is able to keep pace with inflation without exceeding the regulatory cap of 17.5% is displayed on the outputs.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. These returns are based on the portfolio you selected (defaulted to 10X High Equity if your term exceeds 5 year). Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning.

The investment with 10X is assumed to charge a fee according to the 10X Investment fee scale and that the client comes directly to 10X (i.e. no advisor fee). The maximum fee charged by 10X in these scales is 1.03% including VAT per annum.
Your projected benefits are shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected benefits are shown at age 65, unless you have changed the retirement age on the output page.
Where applicable, the projected monthly income assumes that you purchase an inflation-linked guaranteed annuity at retirement with your projected investment value. This estimate assumes that you use your entire projected investment value to purchase an annuity at retirement. Our estimate is based on the recent price of an inflation-linked guaranteed annuity without a spouse. An inflation-linked guaranteed annuity will provide you with an income that grows annually with inflation and pays you an income for the remainder of your life.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections above are based on the default investment strategy called the 10X default glide path, unless you changed the investment portfolio on the output page . The 10X default glide path automatically matches the investment portfolio’s asset allocation to your assumed retirement age. This ensures that when you are more than five years from retirement that you mainly own assets that are expected to deliver high returns - with expected higher volatility of returns - and that the portfolio will gradually be switched into less volatile assets - with expected lower returns - in the last five years before you retire, with the aim of preserving capital.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors.

          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
