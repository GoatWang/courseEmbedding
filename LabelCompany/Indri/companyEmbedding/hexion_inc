Hexion Inc. Key Developments

Hexion Inc. Launches New Two-Component Adhesive for Structural Engineered Wood Lamination
Jul 20 17
Hexion Inc. has introduced a new two-component adhesive system that reduces waste and cleanup costs, enhances durability and supports indoor air quality. This adhesive system, which includes the Ecobind™ 6500 resin and Wonderbond™ Hardener M650Y, is ideal for applications like cross-laminated timbers for tall wood buildings and glue-laminated wood beams. The two components are extruded separately and then mixed when the wood is pressed together. This unique feature provides the user with reduced costs for adhesive waste and cleanup off equipment. Ecobind 6500/Wonderbond M650Y also exceeds all strength, exterior exposure and high-temperature requirements of the North American Structural Wood standards (ANSI A 190.1, 'Structural Glued Laminated Timber,' PRG 320, 'Cross Laminated Timber,' and ASTM D 5456, 'Structural Composite Lumber'). In addition to structural durability, the Ecobind 6500/Wonderbond Hardener M650Y resin system has also achieved UL GREENGUARD Gold Certification. GREENGUARD Gold demonstrates that a product has met some of the world’s most rigorous and comprehensive standards for low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into indoor air and to account for sensitive individuals (such as children and the elderly). It is recognized, referenced or preferred by more than 400 federal purchasers, retailers, green building rating tools and building codes around the world, according to UL Environment, a division of UL (Underwriters Laboratories).

Hexion Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results




First Quarter 2017 Highlights



        Net sales of $870 million and net loss of $42 million
      

        Segment EBITDA of $95 million, a decrease of 11% compared with the 
        prior year period when adjusting for dispositions
      

        LTM Adjusted EBITDA of $418 million
      

        Ongoing growth in the global formaldehyde business as 
        recently-completed strategic investments contributed $4 million of 
        EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017
      

        Recently completed an amendment to our asset-based revolving credit 
        facility (“ABL Facility”) and a refinancing of our 8.875% Senior 
        Secured Notes due 2018 (“1.5 Lien Notes”)
      

        Total liquidity as of March 31, 2017 of $362 million
      








May 04, 2017 07:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”) today announced results for the 
      first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
    


      “Demand for our specialty products remained strong with overall Hexion 
      sales and volumes gains of 6% and 8%, respectively, compared to the 
      prior year and adjusted for our recent divestitures,” said Craig O. 
      Morrison, Chairman, President and CEO. “While the lead lag impact of 
      higher raw materials negatively impacted the first quarter by $5 
      million, we experienced strong momentum in our Forest Products Resins 
      segment, which was able to partially offset raw material headwinds and 
      softening market conditions in our specialty epoxy business. We expect 
      improvement in our specialty epoxy business in the second half of 2017 
      as demand increases.”
    

      Mr. Morrison added: “We also posted improved year-over-year EBITDA 
      results in our oilfield proppants and base epoxy resins businesses, 
      while our recently-completed formaldehyde plants contributed $4 million 
      in EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, we continue to 
      execute our strategic growth program, such as our recently announced new 
      European Technology Center focused on the ongoing development of 
      innovative auto composite applications. Finally, while our strong 
      volumes and seasonal net working capital build impacted our liquidity at 
      quarter-end, in aggregate, we expect to be free cash flow positive for 
      the remainder of the year.”
    

First Quarter 2017 Results


Net Sales. Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were 
      $870 million, a decrease of 4% compared with $909 million in the prior 
      year period. The decline in reported net sales was primarily driven by 
      the impact of recent divestitures. Net sales increased 6% when adjusting 
      for recent divestitures reflecting broad-based volume gains throughout 
      the product portfolio.
    

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 
      2017 was $95 million, a decrease of 22% compared with $122 million in 
      the prior year period. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter of 2017 
      decreased by $12 million, or 11%, when adjusted for divestitures. First 
      quarter 2017 results were driven by growth in our Versatic™ Acids and 
      Derivatives and global forest product businesses, as well as 
      improvements in base epoxy resins and oilfield proppants, which was 
      offset by a year-over-year decline in the specialty epoxy resins 
      business driven by temporary destocking in our Asian-based wind energy 
      business and the negative impact from raw material inflation. In 
      addition, the Company benefited from insurance proceeds in the prior 
      year period related to its Versatic™ Acids and Derivatives business that 
      did not reoccur in the first quarter of 2017.
    

Global Restructuring Programs


      In mid-2016, the Company completed the closure of its Norco, Louisiana 
      facility and began sourcing epichlorohydrin under long-term external 
      supply agreements. In total, the Company expects to achieve $20 million 
      of annualized savings from this strategic initiative and had realized 
      $18 million in savings as of March 31, 2017.
    

      In addition to the Norco closure, the Company has $13 million of 
      incremental, in-process cost savings related to manufacturing cost 
      reductions and $5 million in selling, general and administrative cost 
      savings. As of March 31, 2017, Hexion had $20 million of total 
      in-process cost savings, the majority of which it expects to be achieved 
      in 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


      At March 31, 2017, Hexion had total debt of approximately $3.6 billion 
      compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2016. In addition, at March 31, 
      2017, the Company had $362 million in liquidity comprised of $107 
      million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $235 million of 
      borrowings available under the ABL Facility and $20 million of time 
      drafts and availability under credit facilities at certain international 
      subsidiaries. Hexion expects to have adequate liquidity to fund its 
      ongoing operations for the next twelve months from cash on its balance 
      sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available 
      for borrowings under its credit facilities.
    

      In February 2017, Hexion issued $485 million aggregate principal amount 
      of 10.375% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022 and $225 million 
      aggregate principal amount of 13.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the 
      “New Senior Secured Notes”) (collectively, the “Senior Notes Offering”). 
      In March 2017, proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, along with cash 
      from Hexion’s balance sheet, were used to redeem the outstanding 1.5 
      Lien Notes. In addition, in connection with the Senior Notes Offering, 
      the Company received extended revolving facility commitments under the 
      ABL Facility in aggregate principal amount of $350 million with a 
      maturity in December 2021 and reduced the size of the ABL Facility from 
      $400 million to $350 million.

Covenant Compliance


      The instruments that govern the Company’s indebtedness contain, among 
      other provisions, restrictive covenants regarding indebtedness 
      (including an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio incurrence test), 
      dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, 
      affiliate transactions and capital expenditures.
    

      The indentures that govern the Company’s 6.625% First-Priority Senior 
      Secured Notes, 10.00% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 10.375% 
      First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 13.75% Senior Secured Notes and 
      9.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Secured 
      Indentures”) contain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio 
      incurrence test which may restrict our ability to take certain actions 
      such as incurring additional debt or making acquisitions if the Company 
      is unable to meet this ratio (measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, 
      basis) of at least 2.0:1. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio 
      under the Secured Indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) 
      Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization 
      or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. 
      See “Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” for further information regarding Adjusted 
      EBITDA and Schedule 5 to the release for a calculation of the Adjusted 
      EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio.
    

      The Company’s ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance 
      covenant other than a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 
      that would only apply if the Company’s availability under the ABL 
      Facility at any time is less than the greater of (a) $35 million and (b) 
      12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility 
      commitments at such time. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under the 
      credit agreement governing the ABL Facility is generally defined as the 
      ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and 
      cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain 
      restricted payments, each measured on an LTM basis. At March 31, 2017, 
      the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility exceeded such levels; 
      therefore, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio did not apply.
    

Non-U.S. GAAP Measures


      Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain non-cash 
      and non-recurring expenses. Segment EBITDA is an important measure used 
      by the Company's senior management and board of directors to evaluate 
      operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. 
      Corporate and Other primarily represents certain corporate, general and 
      administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments. Segment 
      EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net loss or other 
      results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See 
      Schedule 4 to this release for reconciliation of net loss to Segment 
      EBITDA.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and 
      certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro 
      forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business 
      optimization programs or other programs and the expected future impact 
      of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt 
      instrument. As the Company is highly leveraged, it believes that 
      including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate 
      Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the 
      Company’s ability to comply with its financial covenants and to obtain 
      additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges are not 
      defined terms under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of 
      financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be 
      considered as an alternative to net loss determined in accordance with 
      U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. 
      GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash 
      flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not take into 
      account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our 
      indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because the Company 
      uses capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a 
      necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working 
      capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our 
      operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to 
      operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges 
      under the Secured Indentures should not be considered an alternative to 
      interest expense. See Schedule 5 to this release for reconciliation of 
      net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and the Fixed Charges Ratio.
    

Forward Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements 
      within the meaning of and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, our 
      management may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. 
      All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified 
      by the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” 
      “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “seek” or “intend” and 
      similar expressions. Forward-looking statements reflect our current 
      expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and 
      other future events and conditions and are based on currently available 
      financial, economic and competitive data and our current business plans. 
      Actual results could vary materially depending on risks and 
      uncertainties that may affect our operations, markets, services, prices 
      and other factors as discussed in the Risk Factors section of our 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). While 
      we believe our assumptions are reasonable, we caution you against 
      relying on any forward-looking statements as it is very difficult to 
      predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to 
      anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important 
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, a 
      weakening of global economic and financial conditions, interruptions in 
      the supply of or increased cost of raw materials, the loss of, or 
      difficulties with the further realization of, cost savings in connection 
      with our strategic initiatives, including transactions with our 
      affiliate, Momentive Performance Materials Inc., the impact of our 
      substantial indebtedness, our failure to comply with financial covenants 
      under our credit facilities or other debt, pricing actions by our 
      competitors that could affect our operating margins, changes in 
      governmental regulations and related compliance and litigation costs and 
      the other factors listed in our SEC filings. For a more detailed 
      discussion of these and other risk factors, see the Risk Factors section 
      in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on 
      Form 10-Q and our other filings made with the SEC. All forward-looking 
      statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary 
      notice. The forward-looking statements made by us speak only as of the 
      date on which they are made. Factors or events that could cause our 
      actual results to differ may emerge from time to time. We undertake no 
      obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as 
      otherwise required by law.

          2.0 to 1.0. As of March 31, 2017, we did not satisfy this test. As a 
          result, we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur 
          additional indebtedness and to make investments; however, there are 
          exceptions to these restrictions, including exceptions that permit 
          indebtedness under our ABL Facility (available borrowings of which 
          were $235 at March 31, 2017).

Hexion Inc. Launches New Epoxy Resin System for SMC Manufacturing of Automotive Composites | Business Wire
























































Hexion Inc. Launches New Epoxy Resin System for SMC Manufacturing of 
      Automotive Composites






March 14, 2017 01:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”) will introduce a new specialty 
      epoxy resin system for styrene-free, sheet molding compound (SMC) 
      manufacturing of high-performance automotive composites, at the JEC 
      World 2017 composites event in Paris.
    


      The new offering - EPIKOTETM Resin TRAC 06605/EPIKURETM 
      Curing Agent TRAC 06608 - can be used to produce lightweight 
      semi-structural and structural automotive composite parts, such as 
      floors, electrical vehicle battery enclosures, spare wheel tubs, seat 
      structures, hood inners and more. Hexion’s SMC epoxy system, when 
      combined with glass and carbon fibers, results in parts with superior 
      mechanical properties to those made with standard unsaturated polyester 
      (UP) or vinyl ester (VE) SMC resin systems.
    

      Hexion’s epoxy SMC system also emits fewer volatile organic compounds 
      (VOCs) according to VDA 278 than either standard or low VOC vinyl 
      esters, with emissions well below international exposure limits. The VDA 
      278 recommendation governs organic emissions for molded compounds in 
      automobiles. Because Hexion’s epoxy SMC system is styrene-free, there is 
      no need to track worker styrene exposure to comply with European 
      workplace standard. The new epoxy system’s compatibility with equipment 
      used for other types of SMC (UP and VE) means additional capital 
      investment is often unnecessary.
    

      "This new specialty epoxy product line will help our customers 
      manufacture high performance composite parts via high-volume SMC 
      production with reduced scrap and relatively low labor costs,” said 
      Francis Defoor, Global Market Segment Leader Transportation, Hexion. “It 
      complements our full range of products for compression molding, 
      including resin transfer molding (RTM), liquid compression molding 
      (LCM), and prepreg molding.”
    

      The new epoxy SMC product is supplied as an easy-to-handle 
      resin-plus-hardener system with optional mold release agent. Customers 
      have ready access to Hexion’s comprehensive technical assistance. For 
      more information, please consult Hexion—Hall 6, Booth G54—during the JEC 
      World 2017 International Composites Event in Paris, March 14-16, or 
      visit hexion.com/automotive 
      or hexion.com/contacts.

Helping Propel Ideas Skyward

                    When Neil Armstrong took his first small step on the moon’s surface on July 20, 1969, it wasn’t just a giant leap for mankind – it was a giant leap for GE Silicones. Armstrong took that step in moon boots featuring soles made from GE’s advanced silicone rubber. And today, materials from GE Silicones – now named Momentive – are used on every manned U.S. space flight.
