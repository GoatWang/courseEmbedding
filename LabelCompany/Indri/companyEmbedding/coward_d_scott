It’s exciting to be part of an organization that is playing a major role in the eradication of colorectal cancer. And I should know: I took the test shortly after turning 50 and had a positive result. A subsequent colonoscopy confirmed that I had precancerous lesions. Cologuard made it easy for me to be screened, and as it turned out, I didn’t have time to procrastinate!
