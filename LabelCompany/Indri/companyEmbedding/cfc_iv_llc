4.61.7.1 
                                (05-01-2006)Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC) Subpart F
                           







The taxation of foreign income earned by U.S.
                              controlled foreign corporation drastically changed with the introduction of
                              Subpart F into the Internal Revenue Code in 1962. Subpart F deals with the
                              U.S. taxation of amounts earned by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs).
                              It provides that certain types of income of CFCs, though undistributed, must
                              be included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder in the year the income
                              is earned by the CFC.
                           


It is important to note that the Subpart F sections
                              of the Code take precedence over the foreign personal holding company sections.
                              Further, the rules contained in Subpart Fare to be applied after the income
                              of the CFC has been adjusted to conform to U.S. income tax concepts.
                           


Under certain circumstances, current earnings
                              of a CFC may be deferred from U.S. tax if not actually distributed to the
                              U.S. shareholder. Since domestic entities are currently taxed, it is essential
                              that the relationships between CFCs and domestic entities be at arm’s
                              length. Any allocations of income and deductions between the CFC and its related
                              organizations under IRC section 482 take precedence over the application of
                              the provisions of Subpart F.
                           


The provisions of Subpart F contain many general
                              rules, special rules, definitions, exceptions, exclusions, and limitations
                              that require careful consideration.
                           








4.61.7.2 
                                (05-01-2006)Preliminary Information Needed
                           







The first step in beginning any examination should
                              be to become familiar with the scope and mode of the taxpayer’s operations
                              (e.g., the products and entities involved, etc.). The following information
                              and documents should be secured to meet this objective.  
                           



Obtain consolidated financial statements (if available)
                                       showing balance sheets and operating results of all related and foreign entities;
                                       
                                    


Obtain certified (or other) statements of the individual
                                       foreign entities. (Remember, the regulations provide for English translations
                                       or the services of a qualified interpreter where the books or records are
                                       not maintained in English.);
                                    


Obtain a statement from the taxpayer characterizing
                                       the operations of the various related foreign entities;
                                    


Obtain corporate books (including the minutes of
                                       corporate meetings) of the domestic taxpayer and of the related foreign entities
                                       if available;
                                    


Obtain original Form 1120 and/or Form 1120–F,
                                       or copies thereof, if such returns were filed for any related foreign entity;
                                       
                                    


Obtain copies of all foreign tax returns filed by
                                       related foreign entities in which the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder;
                                    


Obtain or prepare organizational charts showing
                                       the relationship of all domestic and foreign entities. . Be sure stock ownership
                                       percentages are included;
                                    


Ask for a briefing on changes in accounting procedures
                                       designed to meet the requirements relating to IRC section 951. If possible,
                                       this should be done at the first meeting with the U.S. shareholder or his
                                       representative;
                                    


Examine copies of existing company publications,
                                       manuals, instructions, or correspondence that set forth procedures dealing
                                       with foreign income reporting.
                                    


Obtain and examine the original Forms 5471, or copies thereof, if such
                                       returns were filed.
                                    







Subpart F contains many relief provisions. The
                              early stages of the examination should be devoted to determining the applicability
                              of Subpart F and their exclusions, etc. starting with those most easily verified.
                              Audit steps requiring detailed documentation and extensive analyzes should
                              be pursued only after determining that the more apparent relief provisions
                              are not applicable.

Note there are special rules for determining whether
                              a foreign corporation is a CFC for purposes of IRC section 953(a) (insurance
                              income).
                           








4.61.7.4 
                                (05-01-2006)Identification Qualification and Guidelines
                           







Check the Foreign Information Systems (FIS) Tables
                              for names and stock ownership of U.S. shareholders.  
                           



Determine if Form 5471, Information
                                             Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations,
                                       and income statements plus balance sheets have been filed indicating the existence
                                       of a CFC;
                                    


Analyze U.S. taxpayers’ investments and stock
                                       records to detect ownership in foreign corporations;
                                    


Determine direct, indirect, and constructive ownership
                                       of voting power of stock in any foreign corporations. It is important to note
                                       that the ownership rules for defining a U.S. shareholder relate to voting
                                       power of stock. IEs should be alert to attempts to shift formal voting power
                                       to avoid qualification. See Regs. 1.951–1(g)(2) and 1.957–1(b)(2)
                                       and the examples thereunder for illustrations. For purposes of determining
                                       whether the foreign corporation is a CFC determine the value of stock, including
                                       whether any shares have different rights resulting in different values, and
                                       ownership of value of stock.
                                    


Determine who is in actual control of the foreign
                                       corporation if the U.S. shareholders appear to be in the minority;
                                    


Examine income and expense accounts on the U.S.
                                       taxpayer’s books if there is no investment account. Items that might
                                       suggest a foreign investment could include foreign source income, foreign
                                       legal fees, foreign travel expenses, foreign tax paid, and any other types
                                       of expenses suggesting foreign activity;
                                    


The CFC’s stock record books may show ownership
                                       of a subsidiary. By applying the indirect ownership rules, a subsidiary of
                                       the CFC, if ownership is sufficient, may be considered a CFC;
                                    


If the taxpayer owns 10 percent or more of a foreign
                                       corporation, an analysis of the records may indicate the existence of other
                                       U.S. shareholders. Analysis might disclose other owners of the stock that
                                       constructively or indirectly might qualify the foreign corporation as a CFC;
                                       
                                    


If the taxpayer has adopted a new accounting period
                                       verify the conditions of IRC 898, the proposed regulations thereunder and
                                       Rev. Proc. 2002-37 and 2002-39 are satisfied.
                                    


In certain instances a taxpayer may seek CFC treatment for its foreign
                                       corporation, review the corporate documents and related agreements to verify
                                       that the United States shareholder has more than 50 percent of the voting
                                       power of the CFC. See Framatone Connectors USA Inc. v. Comm'r,
                                             118 T.C. 32 (2002).
                                    







After reviewing the above data, it may be possible
                              to eliminate certain U.S. shareholders and foreign entities from consideration
                              with respect to Non-CFCs; entities that are not CFCs for an uninterrupted
                              period of 30 days or more during the taxable year; or shareholders of foreign
                              investment companies where an election under IRC section 1247(a) is in effect.
                              See IRC section 951(c).

If the taxpayer qualifies as a U.S. shareholder
                              under IRC section 951(b) and owns stock directly or indirectly in the CFC
                              under Section 958(a), and if the foreign corporation
                              in question is a CFC for the requisite period, then further analysis may be
                              necessary to determine the taxability under IRC section 951(a).

                              			 amounts, the following exclusions, limitations, etc. should
                              be noted and kept in mind during an examination. The IE can conserve audit
                              time by recognizing the applicability of these limitations early in the examination.
                              Additional discussions of certain of these items appear later in the guidelines.
                              
                           








4.61.7.7 
                                (05-01-2006)Exclusion of U.S. Source Effectively Connected Income
                           







Subpart F income does not include any item includible
                              in the CFC’s gross income as income from sources within the United States
                              that is effectively connected with the conduct by the CFC of a trade on business
                              or the U.S., unless the income is exempt from tax(or subject to a reduced
                              rate of tax) pursuant to a treaty obligation of the U.S. Section 952(b). For
                              purposes of determining exclusions of United States income under IRC section
                              952(b), any exemption (or reduction) with respect to the tax imposed by IRC
                              section 884 will not be taken into account.
                           








4.61.7.8 
                                (05-01-2006)Limitation as to Earnings and Profits
                           







Subpart F income includible in gross income by
                              a U.S. shareholder for any taxable year may not exceed the CFC's earning and
                              profits for the taxable year. IRC section 962(c)(1)(A).
                           


In the computation of earnings and profits determine
                              that earnings and profits are reported according to U.S. standards. See IRC
                              section 964(a) and the regulations thereunder. However, for purposes of IRC
                              section 952(c), earnings and profits will be determined without regard to
                              IRC section 312(n)(4), (5), or (6) (the preceding clause will not apply to
                              the extent it would increase earnings and profits by an amount which was previously
                              distributed by the CFC).

                                (05-01-2006)Certain Prior Year Deficit
                           







The amount of subpart F income included in the
                              U.S. Shareholder’s gross income may be reduced by his pro rata share
                              of the CFC’s prior year qualified deficits. IRC section 952(c)(1)(B).
                               
                           



A qualified deficit is post-1986 deficit in earnings
                                       and profits that is attributable to the same qualified activity as the activity
                                       giving rise to the income to be offset and which has not previously been taken
                                       into account. . IRC section 952(c)(1)(B)(ii).
                                    


A qualified activity is any activity giving rise
                                       to: 1) foreign base company shipping income, 2) foreign base company oil related
                                       income, 3) foreign base company sales income, 4) foreign base company services

A CFC may elect to reduce the amount of Subpart
                              F income attributable to a qualified activity by a current year qualified
                              deficit of a qualified chain member. IRC section 952(c)(1)(C).
                           








4.61.7.11 
                                (05-01-2006)Manufacturing Operations
                           







If the CFC is strictly a manufacturing operation,
                              (without a sales, purchasing or manufacturing branch in another jurisdiction)
                              then no further steps as to that entity need to be taken.
                              However, other related CFCs that purchase from a manufacturing CFC could have
                              subpart F income. If the CFC has a branch operation, it is possible that there
                              could be subpart F income. Refer to the "branch rule"
                              			 in
                              Reg. 1.954–3(b).
                           


Income of the CFC from the sale of goods manufactured in its country
                              of incorporation by anyone is not subpart F income.

                                (05-01-2006)Currency and Other Restrictions
                           







No part of the earnings and profits of a CFC for
                              any taxable year is included in earnings and profits for purposes of IRC section
                              952, IRC section 955, or IRC section 956 if such part could not have been
                              distributed by the CFC to U.S. shareholders because of currency or other restrictions
                              or limitations imposed under the laws of any foreign country. Reg. 1.964–2
                              sets forth definitions, exceptions, and limitations that should be reviewed
                              before an exception is permitted under this provision.
                           








4.61.7.13 
                                (05-01-2006)De Minimus Rule and Full Inclusion Test
                           







IRC section 954(b)(3)(A) provides a de minimus
                              rule that excludes all gross income from being considered as foreign base
                              company income or insurance income if the sum of the CFC’s gross foreign
                              base company income and gross insurance income is less than the 
                                    lesser of 5 percent of gross income or $1 million. Under the full inclusion
                              rule of IRC section 954(b)(3)(B) if more than 70 percent
                              of the CFC’s gross income is foreign base company income and insurance
                              income then all of the CFC’s gross income will
                              be treated as foreign base company income or insurance income.
                           








4.61.7.14 
                                (05-01-2006)De Minimis Rule and Full Inclusion Test Guidelines
                           







Verify the taxpayer’s determination of gross
                              income for the application of the de minimis test. Be alert to attempts to
                              reduce foreign base company income to qualify for a de minimis exception.
                              
                           


Determine that the de minimis test is applied
                              separately to each CFC.
                           


Check that when computing gross foreign base company
                              income for the de minimis test, that there are no reductions for dividends,
                              interest, or deductions allocable to foreign base company income.
                           


Determine that gross income is computed based
                              on U.S. accounting and tax standards.
                           


Determine whether, for purposes of applying the
                              de minimis test, the anti-abuse rule of Reg. 1.954–1(b)(4) applies to
                              aggregate the income of two or more CFCs.

Inspect CFC operating statements to ascertain
                              the amounts and general nature of income reported.
                           


Discuss the general pattern of foreign operations
                              with the taxpayer or representative.
                           


Determine the type of activity, physical facilities,
                              number of employees in the foreign country, products, processes, major suppliers,
                              and material customers.
                           


Analyze the nature and type of income reported
                              by each CFC to determine the correctness of the reported Subpart F income
                              (or to ascertain the existence of Subpart F income where none is reported).
                              This analysis should include the origin and destination of the products and
                              services that produce the CFC’s income.

The CFC records should set forth the basic inclusions
                              in FPHCI even though exclusions are involved. The IE should:  
                           



Determine the extent of ownership of the various
                                       foreign or domestic stocks to ascertain if the CFC owns most of other foreign
                                       corporations. Determine if its interests along with other stockholders, suggest
                                       that any of these foreign corporations are CFCs by indirect or constructive
                                       ownership by the U.S. person or perhaps another U.S. person. If investments
                                       are in U.S. assets, this fact could indicate possible income under IRC sections
                                       951(a)(1)(B) and 956 due to an increase in earnings invested in U.S. property.
                                       
                                    


Be aware that any passive income received by the
                                       CFC claimed under IRC section 954(c)(2) and (c)(3) as excluded from Subpart
                                       F should be checked against the CFC’s records to determine that the
                                       income does qualify for the exclusion as required by the regulations. To qualify
                                       for exclusion, the answer must be a "yes"
                                       			 to the following
                                       questions: If rents or royalties are excluded from this type income, did they
                                       come from the active conduct of a trade or business conducted with unrelated
                                       persons? If dividends, interests, rents, or royalties came from related persons,
                                       did the relationship qualify for exclusion under IRC section 954(c)(3) and
                                       (d)(4)? Was the export financing interest derived from the conduct of a banking
                                       business under 954(c)(2)(B)? If the CFC is a regular dealer in property described
                                       in IRC 954(c)(1)(B), forward contracts, option contracts or similar financial
                                       instruments, does the income otherwise satisfy the requirements of IRC 954(c)(2)(C)?

Foreign base company sales income is income derived
                              from the sale or purchase of personal property with a related person where
                              the property which is purchased (or sold) is manufactured outside the country
                              of incorporation and the property is sold for use (or purchased for use) outside
                              such foreign country. (IRC section 954(d)(1)). Foreign base company sales
                              income can arise in the following types of transactions:  
                           



The purchase of personal property from a related
                                       person and its sale to any person;
                                    


The sale of personal property to any person on behalf
                                       of a related person;
                                    


The purchase of personal property from any person
                                       and its sale to a related person;
                                    


The purchase of personal property from any person
                                       on behalf of a related person.

Analyze gross income figures to ensure that proper
                              costs are deducted from the gross receipts figures.  
                           



Ascertain that the costs are limited to the cost
                                       figures according to U.S. tax accounting concepts.
                                    


Determine if, in arriving at the cost of goods sold
                                       for Subpart F income sales, the taxpayer was consistent in the method of computation
                                       so the de minimis and full inclusions tests are not distorted.
                                    


Be aware that purchases or sales may be made for
                                       a related person with a commission paid to the CFC. The commission paid could
                                       be Subpart F income. The commission could come from the unrelated third party.
                                       
                                    













4.61.7.21 
                                (05-01-2006)Special Rule for Certain Branch Income
                           







A CFC may carry on procurement, manufacturing,
                              or distribution activities through branches in countries other than the CFC’s
                              country of organization. In some situations the use of a branch has substantially
                              the same tax effect as if the branch were a separate corporation. In that
                              case, the branch is treated as a separate corporation and the income attributable
                              to carrying on activities through the branch is foreign base company sales
                              income. IRC section 954(d)(2).
                           


For instance, a CFC may establish a selling branch
                              in another country to escape a 50 percent tax on manufacturing and sales income
                              in the CFC country of organization. The branch country may only tax sales
                              income at 10 percent. The tax advantage would occur only in situations where
                              the CFC country does not tax the branch income. The branch rule in Reg. §1.954–3(b)(1)
                              requires that under such conditions the branch must be treated as a separate
                              corporation. The branch’s foreign base company income, if any, must
                              be computed separately from the CFC home office income. In essence, the branch
                              rule treats the branch as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the CFC and, if it
                              is a selling branch, treats the branch as selling on behalf of the remainder
                              of the CFC, or, if the branch is a manufacturing branch, treats the CFC as
                              selling on behalf of the branch.

Determine the extent to which a CFC operates through
                              branches outside the country of organization of the CFC. This can be accomplished
                              by an examination of financial statements and by discussion with appropriate
                              shareholders or officers.
                           


Review the relevant foreign tax law to learn the
                              advantages of such branch operations.
                           


Determine whether a branch should be treated as
                              a separate corporation by comparing effective tax rates and applying the 90
                              percent, 5 percentage point tests set forth in the Regulations. (Treas Reg,
                              §1,954-3(b)(1)(i)(b) and 3(b)(1)(ii)(
                                    b).
                           


Review the manner in which branch income and expenses
                              are segregated from amounts applicable to the home office or other branches.
                              Consider reallocation if appropriate and material.

Foreign base company sales income does not include
                              income derived from property manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted in
                              the CFC’s country of incorporation. The regulations provide detailed
                              guidelines for making this determination. (See. Treas. Reg. §1.954–3(a)(2).)
                              Before pursuing this area, the IE should contact the International Technical
                              Advisor who handles the Subpart F area for guidance.

The regulations contain rules for making this
                              determination. The ultimate destination of the personal property producing
                              the income is of prime importance. (Treas. Reg. §1.954–3(a)(3).)

                              of the goods. A sale to a third party within the country of manufacture could
                              be questionable if the third party exports the good.

Or "like services"
                                       			 for or on
                                       behalf of any related person outside the country under the laws of which the
                                       CFC is created or organized.
                                    







Foreign base company services income also includes
                              services performed by a CFC in a case where substantial assistance contributing
                              to the performance of such services has been furnished by a related person.
                              Treas. Reg. §1.954–4(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(2)(ii).
                           


Exclusions from foreign base company services
                              income are provided for services that are directly related to:  
                           



The sale or exchange by the CFC of property manufactured,
                                       produced, grown, or extracted by it that are performed before the time of
                                       the sale or exchange, or
                                    


An offer or effort to sell or exchange such property.

                                (05-01-2006)Foreign Base Company Services Guidelines
                           







Ascertain whether the services are performed outside
                              the country of incorporation of the CFC for, or on behalf of, a related corporation
                              and to what extent.  
                           



Separate tests must be made to determine the Subpart F income if the CFC
                                       is both a selling and service organization.
                                    


Generally, services will be considered performed where the persons performing
                                       the services are physically located at the time services are rendered. (See
                                       Treas. Reg. §1.954-4(c)).
                                    


The regulations require an allocation when the services are performed
                                       partially within and partially without the foreign corporation’s country
                                       under the same contract or arrangement. [(See Regulation 1.954–4(c)].
                                       
                                    


Analyze service contracts performed for, or on behalf of, the related
                                       person contract by contract. Income from services performed within the country
                                       of incorporation of the CFC is not Subpart F income. Income from services
                                       performed outside the country of incorporation is Subpart F income. The term "on behalf"
                                       			, for example, means the service could be performed
                                       for an unrelated party who had purchased a machine from a related party. This
                                       service income could still be Subpart F income. [See Treas, Reg §1.954–4(b)].

The term foreign base company shipping income
                              means:  
                           



Gross income derived from, or in connection with,

                                       vessel in foreign commerce.
                                    


Gross income incidental to income described above.
                                       
                                    


Gross income derived from the sale, exchange, or
                                       other disposition of any aircraft or vessel used or held for use in foreign
                                       commerce.

For purpose of the foreign base company shipping
                              income rules, an aircraft or vessel is used in foreign commerce to the extent
                              it is used in the transportation of property or passengers between a port
                              (or airport) in U.S., or in a U.S. possession and a port (or airport) in a
                              foreign country, or between a port (or airport) in a foreign country and another
                              in the same foreign country or another foreign country (See Treas. Reg. §1.954-6(b)(3)).
                              However, foreign base company shipping income, does not include income from
                              the operation of a vessel between two points within the foreign country in
                              which the CFC is created and/or organized and the aircraft or vessel used
                              is registered. See IRC section 954(b)(7).
                           


Income of a corporation that is foreign base company
                              shipping income will not be considered as any other form of foreign base company
                              income and if distributed through a chain of ownership as described in IRC
                              Section 958(a), will not be included in foreign base company income of another
                              CFC in that chain.

Ascertain if aircraft or vessel income and related
                              service income have been properly determined.  
                           



Be aware that, although the 1986 Tax Reform Act repealed the exception
                                       for reinvested shipping income, the withdrawal of pre-1987 previously excluded
                                       investments in foreign base company shipping operations will be included in
                                       Subpart F income under IRC section 951(a)(1)(A)(iii). See Treas. Reg. §1.955A.
                                       
                                    


Remember that oil drilling ships, trawlers, and factory ships are not
                                       considered used in foreign commerce (see Treas Reg. §1.954-6(b)(3)).
                                       They are not considered as qualified investments in foreign base company shipping
                                       operations. See Regs. 1.955A–2(b)(2) and 1.9546(b)(3)(i).

The IRC section 954(b)(4) high tax exception does
                                       not apply to foreign base company oil related income.

                              exclusions, etc. as listed earlier. In addition, the following factors should
                              be considered at this point.

IRC section 959 is designed to prevent previously
                                       taxed earnings from being taxed again, when the earnings are distributed to
                                       another CFC in a chain of ownership or when the earnings are distributed to
                                       the United States shareholders of the CFC. "Previously taxed

                                       			 generally include amounts previously included in income for
                                       U.S. federal income tax purposes.

                                       of the average of the amounts of U.S. property held by the CFC as of the close
                                       of each quarter over the amount of earnings and profits that has previously
                                       been included in the U.S. shareholders gross income as a 956 amount (or that
                                       would have been included but for Section 956), or
                                    


The shareholders pro rata share of the applicable
                                       earnings of the CFC.

                              and previously taxed 956 amounts under IRC section 959(c)(1).
                           


In general, the source of CFC income considered
                              invested in U.S. property for section 956 purposes is immaterial. For example,
                              income derived from manufacturing activities would be subject to this provision.

                                (05-01-2006)Earnings Invested in U.S. Property Limitation For Tax Years Prior
                              to 1993
                           







For taxable years of a CFC beginning before September
                              30, 1993, a U.S. shareholders pro rata share of the increase for any taxable
                              year in the earnings of a CFC invested in U.S. property is the amount determined
                              by subtracting the amount of investment for the close of the preceding taxable
                              year (reduced by amounts paid to which section 959(c)(1) applies) from the
                              amount of investment for the close of the taxable year. To determine the amount
                              of the increase, see the chart in Rev. Rul. 74-436, 1974-2. C/B. 214.
                           


The amount of a CFC’s earnings invested
                              in U.S. property at the close of any taxable year is the total amount of such
                              property held, directly or indirectly, as of that date, to the extent this
                              amount would have been a dividend if it had been distributed on that date.

Where a U.S. shareholder has reduced the basis
                              of property of the CFC by the amount of a liability or excluded property by
                              reason of IRC section 954(c)(2), ascertain that the required statement is
                              attached to the return. See Treas. Reg. §1.956–1(e)(4) and §1.956–2(b)(2).
                               
                           

Example:



                                             Method of Determining Basis








Under IRC section 956 the basis of property is the adjusted basis on the
                                       applicable determination date reduced by depreciation and/or any liability
                                       specifically chargeable to it, such as a mortgage. See IRC section 956(a)
                                       and Treas. Reg. §1.956-1(e)(1) and (e)(3).
                                    


Be alert that a specific charge or liability was not created for the purpose
                                       of artificially increasing or decreasing the investment in U.S. property.
                                       See Treas. Reg. §1.956–1(e)(1) and (e)(3).
                                    


Treas. Reg. §1.956–1(e)(1) states that a liability in excess
                                       of the adjusted basis of the property subject to a liability will not be taken
                                       into account for reducing the adjusted basis of another property that is not
                                       subject to a liability.
                                    


An obligation of a U.S. person to which a CFC is a pledger or guarantor
                                       under certain conditions is considered U.S. property. See Treas. Reg. §1.956–2(c).
                                       
                                    


Receivables due from U.S. persons may constitute investments in U.S. property,
                                       If acquired directly or indirectly from a related U.S. person. See Treas.
                                       Reg. §1.956-3T.
                                    


An obligation of a U.S. person has specific definition. It does not include
                                       certain indebtedness arising out of involuntary conversions of property that
                                       is not U.S. property or any obligation arising in connection with the provision
                                       of services by the CFC to the U.S. person if the amount of the obligation
                                       doesn’t exceed the amount that is ordinary and necessary. The regulation
                                       provides a 60-day safe harbor. See Treas. Reg. §1.956–2T(d)(2)(B).
                                       
                                    


Be aware that certain financing arrangements are permitted. See the special
                                       rules contained in Reg. 1.956–2(c)(2).Be aware that certain financing

The earnings and profits of a CFC will be computed
                              substantially as if such corporation were a domestic corporation. The accounting
                              principles and standards used in foreign countries may vary greatly from those
                              used in the United States. The amounts reported in financial statements of
                              the foreign companies must be recomputed to clearly reflect income based on
                              U.S. tax accounting principles and methods. See IRC section 964 and the regulations
                              thereunder. The proper determination of earnings and property is vital in
                              the examination of a CFC.
                           


Earnings and profits calculations are required
                              for Subpart F income attributable to a U.S. shareholder, computing foreign
                              tax credits allowed to U.S. shareholders with respect to subpart F income,
                              adjustments required for withdrawals of previously excluded subpart F income
                              and investments in U.S. property.
                           


The audit of a given year may give rise to the
                              determination of correct earnings and profits at different time levels as
                              follows; current taxable year, prior years beginning after December 31, 1962,
                              for purposes of IRC section 955(a), any prior year beginning with the most
                              recent and going back as far as February 28, 1913, for purposes of IRC section
                              956(a), post 1986 pool for computing deemed paid taxes with respect to IRC
                              section 951 inclusions.

Determine that the proper books and records were
                              used to compute the profit and loss statement from which the determination
                              of earnings and profits was calculated.  
                           



Determine that the earnings and profits have not been reduced by amounts
                                       included in gross income of U.S. shareholders under IRC section 951(a).
                                    


Review the written statement constituting the elections made by the CFC
                                       shareholders. Ascertain whether there have been any subsequent modifications
                                       or revocations as to these elections.
                                    


Determine if the proper adjustments have been made to reflect U.S. accounting
                                       standards. For example: determine if accounting practices tend to clearly
                                       reflect income, scrutinize asset accounts from time of acquisition and determine
                                       method of asset acquisition to ascertain that when the assets are reflected
                                       at cost, it is historical cost. See Treas. §Reg. 1.964–1 (b)(2)
                                       for the definition of historical costs. Verify that historical cost is the
                                       basis for depreciation, depletion, or amortization, be alert to undervalued
                                       assets or overvalued liabilities that may be allowed under foreign law, scrutinize
                                       profit and loss statements for unallowable deductions, scrutinize balance
                                       sheets for arbitrary reserves and determine how they were established. Inspect
                                       income and expense accounts to verify that income and expenses have not been
                                       equalized over two or more accounting periods. For post 1986 tax years, confirm
                                       that earnings and profits are maintained in the CFC's functional currency
                                       in accordance with the rules of Treas. Reg. §1.969–1T(g).
                                    


Determine if the proper adjustments have been made to reflect U.S. tax
                                       standards such as, method of accounting provisions under IRC section 446;
                                       Inventories under IRC section 471 and 472, depreciation under IRC section
                                       167, compensation plans under IRC section 404A, and elections made under other
                                       applicable provisions of the Code.
                                    


Determine that the controlling U.S. shareholders of a CFC have complied
                                       with all the requirements for an election, adoption or change of an accounting
                                       method or period. Where the controlling U.S. shareholder is included in a
                                       U.S. consolidated return with its U.S. parent, elections, adoptions or changes
                                       of an accounting method or period must be made by the U.S. parent. Remember
                                       timely filed statements are required by the regulations. All other known U.S.
                                       shareholders must be notified with respect to any action taken.

                                (05-01-2006)Exclusion of Previously Taxed Earnings and Profits
                           







The purpose of IRC section 959 is to avoid double
                              taxation that could occur when amounts that have been previously included
                              in the gross income of a US shareholder under IRC section 951 are actually
                              distributed to such shareholders.
                           


IRC section 959 provides that for any taxable
                              year, earnings and profits of a foreign corporation attributable to amounts
                              included in gross income of a U.S. shareholder under IRC section 951 will
                              not again be included in gross income of such shareholders when distributed.
                              In addition, amounts included in gross income of a U.S. shareholder will not
                              be included in gross income of a foreign corporation when such amounts are
                              distributed through a chain of ownership.
                           


See IRC section 986(c) for calculation of exchange
                              gain or loss on a distribution of previously taxed earnings and profits.

Basis of stock should be:  



Increased by the amount of the undistributed IRC
                                       section 951 (a) income in the U.S. shareholder’s tax return, and
                                    


Decreased by a distribution previously taxed as
                                       IRC section 951(a) income.
                                    













4.61.7.43 
                                (05-01-2006)Special Rules for Foreign Tax Credit
                           







Income included in gross income under the provisions
                              of Subpart F as a deemed dividend, is eligible for the indirect foreign tax
                              credit. Credits so allowed will not be allowed again when actual distributions
                              are made. In situations where foreign taxes are imposed at the time of actual
                              distribution (a withholding tax), a foreign tax credit will be allowed, where
                              otherwise allowable, even though the amounts distributed are not taxable because
                              they were previously included in the U.S. shareholder’s income.
                           


The workings of IRC section 960 with respect to
                              the inclusion of subpart F income are generally similar to the workings of
                              IRC sections 901 and 902 with respect to a dividend distribution from a foreign
                              entity. The gross up provision of IRC section 78 similarly applies.
                           


The receipt of the funds representing previously
                              taxed earnings and profits for purposes of IRC section 951(a) does not produce
                              additional indirect foreign tax credits, but may lead to an additional direct
                              foreign tax credit or increase in limitation under IRC section 960(b). Under
                              Treas. Reg. §1.960–4, the year in which the Subpart F income was
                              reported will be called the "year of inclusion."
                              			 The year
                              in which the funds are received relative to the included income will be called
                              the "year of exclusion."
                              			
                           








4.61.7.44 
                                (05-01-2006)Foreign Tax Credit Guidelines
                           







If, in the year of exclusion, the taxpayer claims
                              a deduction for foreign taxes paid on the amount excluded under IRC section
                              959(a)(1), check the Federal income tax return of the year of inclusion to
                              verify that no foreign tax credit was claimed relative to the income included
                              under IRC section 951(a).
                           


With respect to the increase under IRC section
                              960(b)(1) in the limitation under IRC section 904(a) verify that:  
                           



the increase in the IRC section 904 limitation of
                                       the year of inclusion is correctly computed,
                                    


the amount of foreign taxes allowed as credit because
                                       of such increases in the year of inclusion is properly computed. The credit
                                       allowed may have exceeded the taxes deemed paid on the income included under
                                       IRC section 951(a),
                                    


the increase in limitation under this section for
                                       intervening years is properly computed,
                                    


the increase in limitation in the year of exclusion
                                       does not exceed the taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid for such taxable year
                                       on the amount to be excluded under IRC section 959(a)(1).
                                    






Note:
Note that if the
                                 increase in limitation under IRC section 960(b)(1) and Treas. Reg. §1.960–4
                                 for a taxable year of exclusion exceeds the tax (before any credits against
                                 tax) imposed by Code Chapter 1, such excess will be considered an overpayment
                                 of tax. The tax is refundable or creditable according to Code Chapter 65 (IRC
                                 section 6401 and following).
                              











4.61.7.45 
                                (05-01-2006)General Rules and Record Keeping Requirements of U.S. Shareholders
                              
                           







Treas. Reg. §1.964–3 describes the
                              record keeping requirements of the U.S. shareholder. The regulations specifically
                              require that a U.S. shareholder will, within a reasonable time after demand
                              by the Area Director, give the Area Director:  
                           



Such permanent books of account or records as are
                                       sufficient to satisfy the requirements of IRC section 6001 and IRC section
                                       964(c) or true copies thereof, as are reasonably demanded,
                                    


If such books and records are not maintained in
                                       the English language either an accurate English translation of such books
                                       and records or the services of a qualified interpreter satisfactory to the
                                       Director of Field Operations.
                                    







The requirements of IRC section 6001 and IRC section
                              964(c) will be considered satisfied if the books or records produced are sufficient
                              to verify for the taxable year:  
                           



The Subpart F income (and exclusions therefrom)
                                       of the CFC,
                                    


The previously excluded Subpart F income of such
                                       corporation withdrawn from qualified investment (IRC section 955),
                                    


The increase in earnings invested by such corporation
                                       in U.S. property.
                                    













4.61.7.46 
                                (05-01-2006)Special Rules and Record Keeping Requirements of U.S.Sharedholders
                              
                           







Reg. 1.964–3(c) provides special rules that
                              state that verification of the Subpart F income of the CFC for the taxable
                              year is not required if either:  
                           



It can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director
                                       of Field Operations that the locus and the nature of such corporation’s
                                       activities make it unlikely that the foreign base company income of such corporation
                                       exceeded 5 percent of its gross income for the taxable year, or
                                    


If certain conditions are met for certain insurance
                                       companies.
                                    







Remember that the burden of demonstrating that
                              these conditions exist is upon the taxpayers. If they cannot carry this burden,
                              then the general rules apply.
                           


The special rules refer solely to relief from
                              maintaining records to verify subpart F income of the CFC. The taxpayer must
                              still maintain records to verify previously excluded subpart F income, and
                              the increase in investments in U.S. property by the CFC.
                           


lEs should recognize that submission of the required
                              records can be extremely burdensome upon taxpayers if requested indiscriminately.
                              IEs should carefully consider such requests. Request only records most pertinent
                              to each particular situation.
                           


If the taxpayer has not maintained adequate records,
                              the taxpayer should be advised of the nature of the inadequacies and the requirements
                              of the regulations.
                           


Exhibits IRM 4.61.2-1 and IRM 4.61.2–2 provide
                              guidelines for obtaining information, books, and records of U.S. and foreign
                              entities.
