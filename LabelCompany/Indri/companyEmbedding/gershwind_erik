 Educational Background



Bachelor's in Economics, summa cum laude 


University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School

                  The Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wharton was the world’s first collegiate business school and the first business school in the United States. It was established in 1881 through a donation of Joseph Wharton.                




Graduate, magna cum laude 


Harvard University - Harvard Law School

                  Harvard Law School offers an energetic and creative learning environment, a diverse and dedicated faculty—whose expertise spans a broad array of legal subjects—and a student body that comes from every state in the U.S. and more than 70 countries around the world.

Approximately 1,900 students attend HLS each year: 1,680 J.D. students, 160 LL.M. students, and 50 S.J.D. candidates. The faculty includes more than 100 full-time professors and more than 150 visiting professors, lecturers on law, and instructors. The curriculum features more than 260 courses and seminars that cover a broad range of traditional and emerging legal fields.

A Harvard Law education prepares students for success in law practice, business, public service, teaching, and more. Most HLS students are pursuing a J.D. (Juris Doctor) degree, while many others are earning an LL.M. (Master of Laws) or the S.J.D. (Doctor of Juridical Science). Harvard Law School also offers many joint degree programs, coordinated programs, and concurrent degree opportunities with other schools within Harvard University. The Law School community is also home to numerous research programs and engaging publications, including books, scholarly periodicals, newsletters, and a weekly student newspaper.

	Industrial tools and supplies may not be glitzy products to sell, but selling them has added a lot of glitz to the balance sheet of MSC Industrial Direct Co., one of the largest public companies headquartered on Long Island.
	The distributor's revenue, which passed the $2-billion mark in 2011, has grown an average of 15 percent annually for the past few years. Its return on equity -- an indication of how efficiently it uses investors' money -- was an impressive 21.4 percent in its 2012 fiscal year.

	And the company has plenty of cash on hand for investments and acquisitions. Last month, it completed its biggest acquisition, the $550-million purchase of Barnes Distribution North America, a Cleveland-based industrial distributor.
	Despite its success, MSC prefers a low-key image. The business is housed in an unassuming one-story white tile and brick building in Melville. All the offices are the same size, no matter the title of the occupant, says Erik Gershwind, president and chief executive. The only reserved parking is a space set aside to honor the late founder, Sid Jacobson, Gershwind's grandfather. Jacobson started the business in Brooklyn in 1941, when it was known as Sid Tool Co.
	Gershwind, 41, who seldom wears a tie, says the informal approach helps to promote the spirit of cooperation, which he says is key to MSC's success.
	He has worked at the company since 1996 and became just the fourth chief executive in MSC's 72 years when he took the reins Jan. 1.
So you think the spirit of collaboration and cooperation contributes to morale and the bottom line?

	Having people who believe in what you believe in, value what you value and really are passionate around the mission of the organization is probably the single most important element of our business.
What's the toughest challenge facing your business?
	In North America alone, the market we compete in is about $140 billion. And the top 50 competitors, including ourselves, have only 30 percent [total] of the market. That creates an amazing growth opportunity for us. The challenge that comes with it is the need to stay disciplined. It would be easy to get sidetracked to just try to grab everything. So there is a strong sense of not just growing for the sake of growing but understanding where we want to grow.
So that means there are a lot more potential clients and a lot more opportunities for acquisitions?
	Yes. We see part of our growth coming organically, meaning on our own, and part of that coming through acquisitions. We have a very strong balance sheet. We generate a lot of cash. So definitely we have a big appetite for growth.

What challenges do you face in doing business on Long Island in particular?
	We love Long Island. I love Long Island. I have grown up here. And we've got a very strong talent base here of people who have grown up with the business. As we look to position the company in the next five years, the next 10 years, the next 15 years, the biggest challenge we saw was access to enough talent, particularly enough talent in an industrial business.
So Davidson, N.C., for example, where you will soon open a second headquarters, has a big enough industrial base that generates enough talent?
	It really does. What we decided is we can't and wouldn't abandon Long Island. It was too important, too much woven into the fabric of the company. But we needed to have an additional location for expansion.
By 2016, you hope to grow revenue to $4 billion, double the $2 billion your company first reached in 2011. What's fueling your optimism?

	No. 1 is the market that we compete in; the dynamics that I described. It's a huge market, and it's highly fragmented. There's a tremendous opportunity with those dynamics for larger companies, well-run, well-capitalized companies to take advantage of market dynamics. The second thing is we give [our customers] one-stop shopping. So we carry 600,000 items in inventory, and if a customer calls us by 8 p.m., they're going to see [their shipment] the next day. Our field sales organization is currently 1,100 people. With the Barnes acquisition, we will be at around 2,000 and will actually cover every ZIP code in the U.S.
What things do you sell the most of?
	The roots of the company and where my grandfather got started is cutting tools and metalworking supplies. That's were the bread and butter of the company has been. Within metalworking, we look at ourselves as the market leader; we have a market share of around 10 percent in the U.S. We carry 600,000 items, and around half of those are in metalworking.
Your company is growing and hiring mostly off Long Island. Is that because of business conditions on Long Island like higher costs?
	I think it's a function of where we can access the industrial talent so we can continue to grow the business.

	You have some impressive academic credentials. You graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's in economics from the Wharton School of Business and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School.
Given your outstanding academic background, are you running the company differently from the way your uncle or your immediate predecessor, David Sandler, did?
	We view this as a relay race. So I don't have to come in with any new vision. There's a lot of continuity here. We also have a strategic planning process that is grounded in principles that have survived years and years. Certainly, any of the four of us operated the business in a different time and in different conditions, and there's no question that our growth ambitions of $4 billion will require some different things than the business did at $1 billion.
What's one thing you've learned on the job that neither business school nor law school taught you?
	I would say the biggest thing is the power of a culture to drive performance, of having people who believe what you believe and value what you value. You can't overestimate that.

MSC Scours the Industrial 'Attic' for $100 Billion in Waste

The Great Recession saw manufacturing “flipped on its head,” Erik Gershwind, president and CEO of MSC Industrial Supply, tells a reporter at the IMTS trade show in Chicago. As a $2.5 billion distribution company that both buys from, and sells to, manufacturers, MSC had a close-up view of the pain inflicted on the industry, and has used the insights it gained from that experience to fuel a new sense of mission. Gershwind’s grandfather started the company in 1941, selling cutting tools from the trunk of his car to job shops around New York’s Lower East Side. MSC’s close relationship with manufacturing served it well as both grew over the ensuing decades, but that same relationship meant MSC also felt the sting of the business downturn that started in 2008. “We had quarters where revenues were down 25%, profits were down 35%,” he recalled. Though a public company, MSC has a large family ownership interest which allows it to take a longer view of its business. Wall Street wanted the company to cut personnel during the recession. Company managers saw that as a short-term fix with long-term repercussions. When business improved, they believed, it would leave them with the task of hiring inexperienced employees who did not know its customers. Instead, MSC decided to use the downturn to not only hold onto staff, but make investments in its business systems and website. Gershwind and other executives also spent a good deal of time examining the company’ strategy and how it would drive growth for the next decade. Prior to the recession, says Gershwind, manufacturer’s purchasing activities had been focused on price and global sourcing. But with the recession, he said, “Cash became paramount.” Companies began to look at their supply chains and found that they had excessive amounts of cash tied up in inventory. They were eager to find ways to reduce those non-productive assets. Yet, manufacturers frequently were operating with smaller staffs. In many cases, they didn’t have the time or expertise to root out waste. Those constraints provided an opportunity for MSC. “We rallied around the mission of improving and optimizing the plant floor,” said Gershwind. While companies had put a good deal of focus on their direct materials costs, they often gave less attention to indirect materials – everything from hand tools to cleaning supplies. Gershwind likens indirect materials to the attic in a house – out of sight, messy, neglected. MSC’s says a lack of visibility into the supply chain results in nearly $100 billion in MRO inventory waste annually for U.S. companies. The company says it can help companies clean up their “attic” in three ways:   Look for time savings. Save time and financial savings will follow. MSC worked with a packaging company that had a large plant in the southeast with a central storeroom for supplies. MSC audited the facility and found that machine operators were walking a total of a mile to the storeroom and back to get a tool – and doing it sometimes 3 to 4 times a day, at $20 per hour. MSC installed 150 industrial vending units, providing visibility into supply usage and putting the supplies close to workers, eliminating the long walks. The company saved more than $1 million with the new system.  Use technology as a flashlight. MSC offers an inventory management system called ControlPoint which provides companies better visibility into the products they purchase and where they are used. ZF, the German manufacturer of driveline and chassis parts, implemented the system. At one of the pilot plants, production increased 20%, but consumption of cutting tools dropped by 20%. Gershwind said the visibility the system provided allowed ZF to reduce their cutting tool inventory from eight weeks to two weeks. The time spent on reporting on cutting tool inventory and costs was reduced from 8 hours to 15 minutes.  Get another set of eyes. “Several hundred of our sales people are metalworking experts,” Gershwind said. “These are people with machinist backgrounds who come out of a manufacturing environment.” On one site assessment, he recalled, one of MSC’s experts watched a machine operator who was drilling and then reaming holes in parts. When asked why he was doing the extra work, the operator explained that the drill couldn’t provide the tight tolerances needed for the part. MSC’s expert contacted a supplier and found a custom drill that could do the work. The result: the machine shop saved $30,000 annually in labor and raw materials costs.

MSC Industrial, No. 14 on Industrial Distribution’s 2014 Big 50 list, has announced the promotion of several key executives.
Jim Drohan has assumed the leadership role at Class C Solutions Group (CCSG). Drohan has served as the company’s vice president of business development for the past two years.
“He brings with him a wealth of management experiences with several large industrial companies,” said Erik Gershwind, president and CEO of MSC during a conference call with financial analysts. Drohan replaces Ray Rutledge.
Gershwind also said that four internal company leaders were being promoted to senior vice presidents. They are: Steve Baruch, who leads Strategy and Marketing; Chris Davanzo, controller and a key leader within finance; Greg Polli, who runs Product Management; and Dave Wright, who leads MSC’s field sales force.
“These are four individuals who have continued to deliver strong results, and demonstrated company leadership over many years,”  he said.
The company had previously announced that Rustom Jilla has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer effective July 20. Jilla succeeds Jeff Kaczka, who is retiring.
