 Educational Background



BS in Finance & Economics 


Susquehanna University

                  Susquehanna University was founded in 1856 by Benjamin Kurtz as the Lutheran based Missionary Institute paired with a sister college, the Susquehanna Female College. When the sister college closed in 1873, the missionary institute became co-educational, and in 1895 it became a four-year school renamed Susquehanna University. The school's 325 acres sit in rural Pennsylvania and house 39 residential buildings, 6 academic buildings, a library, athletic facilities, a health center, and several administrative buildings.                




MBA 


College of William and Mary - Mason School of Business

                  The Mason School of Business has deep roots in the history and traditions that has made the College of William and Mary one of the most distinguished liberal arts universities in the nation. Founded in 1693, the College is the second oldest university in the nation-the first was Harvard-and educated many of the nation's Founding Fathers and leaders spanning five centuries, thus earning the name "alma mater of a nation." It ranks consistently among the top 10 public, undergraduate liberal arts colleges in the United States.

True to its pioneering legacy, CIT remains an agent of opportunity, providing new resources and fresh perspectives to over one million clients across thirty industries around the globe.

GTE Corporation


                  GTE Corporation ranked as the world's third-largest publicly owned telecommunications company in 1996. With over 20 million telephone access lines in 40 states, the communications conglomerate was America's leading provider of local telephone services. The $6.6 billion acquisition of Contel Corporation in 1990 nearly doubled GTE's Mobilnet cellular operations, making it the second-largest provider of cellular telephone services in the United States, with over two million customers. GTE's strategy for the mid- to late 1990s focused on technological enhancement of wireline and wireless systems, expansion of data services, global expansion, and diversification into video services. On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic Corporation (BNTR) and GTE Corporation (GTTC) merged into one company, Verizon Communications (VCTR).
