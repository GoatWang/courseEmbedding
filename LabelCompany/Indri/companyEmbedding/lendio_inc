Merchant Cash Advance vs. Small Business Loan
 

 





 
Merchant Cash Advance
You can access funding from $5,000 to $300,000. Here’s how it works:


We purchase a set dollar amount of your business’s future credit/debit sales at a discounted price, we pay you this price in a lump sum cash funding.


We collect an agreed upon percentage of each future credit/debit transaction that you process. We do this directly through your processor, or we ACH the amount from your bank.


Your future payments vary based upon your future sales volume— so payments are cash flow friendly!
More questions on a merchant cash advance? Watch this video here to find out more.  
 




 
Small Business Loans
With this solution, you can access funding $5,000 to $500,000. The steps to get funding are easy:


We review your application and your banking and credit card processing history (if applicable) and consult with you on the loan amount, payment, and funding structure


We collect a set daily payment amount from your bank account via ACH debit


Your future payments are fixed so you can plan your future cash flow.
 

 



 
The Merchant Cash Advance Solution
If you have a history of credit card acceptance, then a Merchant Cash Advance may be just what you need. Your history of credit card volume is used to determine the amount of funds that can be advanced. A Merchant Cash Advance requires a minimal operating history and the lowest possible credit requirements. Your payments fluctuate, and are dependent upon the amount of your future credit card sales. The amount that you pay is either collected directly through the daily deposits of your merchant processing account or collected by daily ACH debit to your bank account.
 




 
The Small Business Loan Solution
This solution is ideal for the stronger credit profile, and business with strong consistent cash flow that desires a fixed payment structure. Additionally, the funding amount is not limited by your credit card processing volume. If you have at least 9 months operating history in your business, and prefer a fixed payment structure, then let us quote you a Small Business Loan. Funding time is still about 3 days after submission of your complete application package!

A Business Loan That's Fast and Efficient






By Kari Luckett


































Any type of loan can be a long, drawn-out process. Most adults have had the experience of getting a mortgage, student loan or something as simple as a credit card or auto loan. Anyone that has gotten a mortgage in the last decade has experienced the task of coming up with all the proper paperwork and basically go down to their bank or their broker to provide them with that information.  Then the back and forth process ensues that can be quite lengthy, so inherently, people have this view of lending that it's terribly complicated; and that's what SnapCap is trying to change. 
30-Second Turnaround 
The component pieces SnapCap looks at are credit, credit score of the individual owner (which is a function of any lending decision), time in business -which has a great deal to do with your continuity- and your annual revenue. Naturally, a business that started six months or a year ago is inherently much riskier than one that's been around for two, three or ten years. 
The main value provided to borrowers and that SnapCap does way better than anyone else right now is near-live interaction. Someone who comes to the website, completes an application and provides their basic information is often contacted while still on the website. SnapCap strives to reach out to their users within 30 seconds of the application. It's hard to find that type of customer service anywhere else, in almost any other industry online and offline. 
For example, let's say a business owner visits SnapCap.com and needs $100,000 within a week for a seasonal inventory spike that they may not have anticipated. They're going to fill out a very basic application, provide 90 days' bank data and some additional clarifying information, and they will then be on a fast-track to a loan decision. 
Trust in Lending
SnapCap strives to gain the trust of their applicants before asking for detailed, personal information. "With us, we're looking to provide value to the businesses we give money to, so one thing we found that we do particularly well is we get people on the phone," said Hunter Stunzi, founder of SnapCap. "We have good quality conversations with our customers, educate them on how these loans work, and discuss the upside and value of the loan."
Business owners don't have to worry about SnapCap collecting their social security numbers, tax IDs or other intrusive information when they first apply for a business loan online. "We think it's inappropriate and a lot of our competitors do that," said Stunzi. All the user needs to do initially is provide their basic information and a loan advisor will give them a call to explain the process. At that point, the consumer can decide if it's a right fit for them and how to move forward. 
Borrowers who pay their loans back on time will be pleased to learn that it doesn't go unnoticed. Responsible borrowers may be extended greater benefits in the future in the form of larger loans, longer terms, or something as simple as lower interest rates. The key to any business model is to retain good, quality users.
Behind the Scenes
The technology piece is really the best component of SnapCap's business. Thanks to the digital age where everything is readily available online, consumers can now provide all the required information very fast. Once a tax ID number has been provided, a loan advisor can then do a LexisNexis search and see if the business is in good standing with the secretary of state, if they pay taxes and check if there's anything major or derogatory that might make it irresponsible to approve a loan. 
Once a borrower submits their social security number, SnapCap has a pretty good window into their credit history and who they are as a borrower. Someone who is totally maxed out with all of their trade lines, at risk for bankruptcy, not paying their mortgage, etc., won't be an appropriate borrower. This type of analysis is very important due to the short-term loans that are provided, which are typically 6, 9, 12, and 18-month loans. 
"What we think we've solved is the ability to acquire users online at a very attractive price point relative to our competitors. It's not just because we're able to spend money more efficiently, but we're also interacting with the user in a real-time environment that makes them feel valuable."

Financial Innovation

If Lending Club’s expansion succeeds, it’s more likely that it will be the company that hooks you up when it’s time to buy that new car, send the kid to college, or pay off that high-interest credit card. And those with money to save will be more likely to lend it out for vastly better interest than the near-zero rates that bank savings accounts offer today.

Business Loans And Small Business Financing Options | Lendio        
       Find the Right Loan for Your BusinessKey Questions to Ask When You Get a Business Loan  How Do I Get Funding?      The short answer: there are many ways to get funded. The long answer: Lendio has a network of 75+ partner lenders, which means we offer loan options for just about any business need you might have. Take 15 minutes to fill out our magical online application, then see all your funding options. It’s that simple.  Which Loan Is Best for Me?      Picking your favorite can be hard, we get it. That’s why we pair you with one of our personal funding managers when you apply. The funding manager will walk you through all your loan options, talk to you about your needs, and help you pick the loan that’s best for your business. Think of it as a financing buddy system.  How Much Will This Loan Cost?      If we had ESP, we’d just throw a number at you and add some sort of cool sparkle effect here. But we can’t tell you that until we know how much you need, what you want to use your loan for, what your credit score is, and maybe a few other factors. But we can tell you that we help you get a loan you can actually afford.  How Soon Can I Get Funded?      For SBA loans, it could be a few months - for other loans, it could be as little as 24 hours. It all depends on what kind of financing you need. If you need funds lickety-split, we offer several different loans that get funded faster than you can say “put money in my pocket,” including short term loans and merchant cash advances.  How Will I Pay Back the Loan?      More standard financing options like term loans, SBA loans, and commercial mortgages are paid back on a monthly schedule. If you opt for something like American Express Merchant Financing, a short term loan, or a merchant cash advance, you’ll probably have daily or weekly payments. As long as you pay on time, everyone’s happy. Find Your Loan Business Line of CreditLoan Amount:$1,000-500,000Loan Term:1-2 Year Maturity DatePayment Frequency:Monthly Think of a line of credit as a soft, cozy financial cushion for your business. It’s there if you need it, but you’re not required to use it. If you have a credit score of 560 or higher, you’ll probably qualify for a line of credit. Learn more about Business Lines of Credit SBA LoansLoan Amount:$50,000-5,000,000Loan Term:10-25 YearsPayment Frequency:Monthly SBA loans were developed by Uncle Sam to support small business growth in America.

Learn more about SBA Loans Short Term LoanLoan Amount:$2,500-500,000Loan Term:1-3 YearsPayment Frequency:Daily, Weekly, or Bi-Monthly Surprises happen - and that’s why the short term loan exists.

Learn more about Short Term Loans Business Term LoanLoan Amount:$5,000-2,000,000Loan Term:1-5 YearsPayment Frequency:Weekly, Bi-Monthly, or Monthly A term business loan is a standard loan that offers fixed interest rates, regular repayment terms, and a fixed maturity date. See, pretty standard. This kind of loan is best for a business that isn’t brand new, and it can be used to fund anything from an expansion to an equipment purchase. Learn more about Business Term Loans Merchant Cash AdvanceLoan Amount:$5,000-200,000Loan Term:3-24 MonthsPayment Frequency:Daily, Weekly, or Monthly Does your wallet feel a little light and airy right now?

Maybe even all three, although that’s a weird combo. Because business equipment varies so much between industries, there are several different equipment financing options to choose from. Learn more about Equipment Financing Commercial MortgageLoan Amount:$250,000-5,000,000Loan Term:20-25 YearsPayment Frequency:Monthly A commercial mortgage can help you buy, build, expand, remodel, or refinance. And it offers several sweet benefits: it’s a secure piece of collateral, typically has low interest rates, and helps you start earning equity.

SBA Loans and Loan Programs | Lendio        
         SBA Loans The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is a federal agency that supports small business development and growth. This agency does not actually provide the loans. It establishes the guidelines for all SBA loans and then guarantees a portion of the loan, (in the case of default) which diminishes the risk for its lending partners.Quick facts and RequirementsLoan Amount$50,000-5,000,000Loan Term10-25 YearsPayment FrequencyMonthlyInterest RatePrime+Time to Funds30 days - 90 days Find Your LoanBenefits & Drawbacks  SBA financing up to 90%  Loan terms up to 25 years  Fixed and variable rate options  Lots of paperwork  May require collateral  There is a strict acceptance criteriaWhat Is an SBA Loan? An SBA Loan is a loan given through the Small Business Association. The SBA is a government agency built solely for the purpose of assisting small businesses acquire the funding they need. Recognizing the incredible importance of small businesses on the American economy (roughly 99% of all American businesses are considered “small”) the SBA was formed to bolster the growth and prosperity of our nation by supporting the small businesses and entrepreneurs who keep the American dream alive and well.In that vein, an SBA loan is one that has been approved by the SBA, and in most cases co-sponsored by a traditional financial institution. The SBA provides some of the loan money, while the financial institution provides the remainder, together meeting the funding needs of the approved loan. Typically the SBA will take on a larger portion of the loan amount and guarantee the loan, leaving the financial institution with less risk.The 3 primary loans from the SBA are SBA 7(a), SBA 504, and SBA Express loans, each of which serve different purposes, with different terms, rates, and loan amount limits. Therefore, which SBA loan product you choose should depend heavily on what specific needs you have for your business.Why Choose an SBA Loan? While SBA loans are significantly easier to attain than a traditional bank loan, they still present the most challenges compared with other non-institutional lenders. For example, SBA loans are more paperwork intensive, typically have a much longer time to funds, as well as a higher percentage of rejection than direct online lenders.Still, SBA loans are some of the most sought-after loans for small businesses because of their benefits. The primary benefit of an SBA loan is that it allows you to get rates and terms that are comparable to bank loans even when you may not be able to secure a bank loan. The SBA does this by taking on a larger part of the loan and guaranteeing the loan, which makes the loan product significantly more desirable for banks than your loan itself. This encourages banks to fight for your business, which in turn gives you better rates and terms, while still being a very safe investment for banks themselves.SBA loans are an attractive option for other many other reasons as well. For example, SBA loans all carry monthly payments, fixed interest rates, long repayment terms, and generally make for an excellent step towards improving your credit so you can apply for a bank loan when you need your next round of funding.SBA 7(a) Loans Aside from having bank quality rates and terms, SBA 7(a) loans are some of the most versatile loans on the market. That means they have virtually no restrictions on usage, as long as the money is going to be used for business purposes. This includes (but is not limited to) acquiring a business, refinancing, startup funds, equipment, partner buyout, and the purchase of real estate. Because of its unparalleled flexibility, SBA 7(a) loans are by far the most common SBA loan on the market.Originally put together to help specific industries acquire financial help, the SBA 7(a) program comprises several other subsidiary programs:Export Loan ProgramRural Business Loan ProgramExpress & Pilot ProgramsSpecial Purpose Loans Program The intention behind this loan product was to assist businesses with unique requirements meet their financial needs. SBA 7(a) loans are now available to nearly all types of businesses, and serve a vital role in sparking economic growth by committing more capital to small businesses and entrepreneurs in underserved communities.SBA 7(a) loans can range between $50,000-$5,000,000, with a loan term that ranges from 10 to 25 years depending on what the loan will be used for, along with other details. Also, your loan will be repaid monthly.SBA 504 Loans For all intensive purposes, SBA 504 loans are just like SBA 7(a) loans, only optimized around real estate. Because of this, SBA 504 loans are limited to real estate only. However, they are some of the best loans on the market when it comes to acquiring major fixed assets, expanding, or modernizing your current business property. For example, SBA 504 loans allows you to finance up to 90% of the appraised property value, or 100% of the outstanding principal, whichever is lower. They will also include eligible refinancing costs.There are a few eligibility requirements for this kind of loan however:Your business must operate for profitYour business must meet fit and size guidelines set by the SBA for the 504 programTangible net worth can’t exceed $7.5 millionNet income can’t exceed $2.5 million after taxes504 loans can’t be given to businesses that speculate504 loans can’t be given to businesses that invest in rental real estate SBA 504 loans can range between $50,000-5,000,000. The loan term is also 20 years, to be repaid in monthly payments.SBA Express Loans In the same way the SBA 504 loans are basically an SBA 7(a) loan optimized for real estate, an SBA Express loan is the SBA loan fine-tuned for speed and efficiency. Typically, the more expediently a loan is processed, the worse the terms and rates, and the less desireable the lender. SBA Express loans function to offer funding for businesses that require fast financing while still providing bank-like rates and terms.In order to decrease approval time, the maximum amount of the loan is reduced, and the usage is limited to financing equipment, debt consolidation, and increasing working capital. Here are some good facts to know about SBA Express loans:Can be pre-approved in less than 2 daysMaximum loan amount of $350,000Maximum SBA guarantee is 50%Interest rate is negotiable between borrower and lenderRates can be variable or fixed, tied to a prime rate, LIBOR, or the optional peg rateRates may not surpass SBA’s maximum ratesLenders are not required to take collateral for loans up to $25,000 Additionally, you can get an SBA Express loan from as little as $5,000 up to $350,000, and the loan term is typically 10 years, repaid in monthly payments.Getting An SBA LoanStep 1- Application The first stage in your loan approval process involves meeting your SBA lender and giving him or her enough information to assess your loan application for a pre-approval letter. Items you’ll want to have with you include (but are not limited to)Business and personal financial statements Business and personal tax returns for the last three years Completed application outlining how the proceeds will be used Signed authorization for background and credit checks Resumes for your primary managers and your ownersYou can use Lendio’s platform to connect with lenders that offer these long-term, low-interest loans. In order to expedite the process, follow the SBA’s recommended business plan outline. This will likely save you further questions and time down the line.Step 2- Approval  Depending on the type of loan applied for and your particular circumstance, the time to approval will vary. However, once you have tendered a complete loan package it’s only a matter of time before an approval comes through. Typically, the timeframe from submission of the application to disbursement of funds takes about 30-60 days, depending on the complexity of the loan.If you do receive SBA approval, your bank will then offer you a proposal. It is good practice to apply to more than one bank, even if you have the word of a preferred lender. Some borrowers can get several weeks into the process, only to receive a rejection from the bank later. Though this is a rare scenario, taking precautions will minimize the issues you will face along the way.Step 3- Underwriting You will enter the underwriting phase after accepting the proposal from the bank. For SBA loans, this phase comprises the exchange of all the information required (there is quite a bit of it), a complete evaluation, and an official approval or decline of your application. To improve your chances of approval, try to provide as large a down payment as feasible for your company. The typical SBA loan requires only 10 percent down, but if you can mitigate the bank’s risk with a larger down payment or a personal guarantee (particularly if your venture is risky) that could help push your loan through the process faster and with less chance of rejection.Step 4- Closing During this period loan terms are settled and signed, and guarantee fees and closing costs are paid. The length of this process is also determined by the complexity of the arrangement. Loans under $150,000 can take as little as 30 days from application to funding, however they can also take much longer in some circumstances. The timeframe is primarily dependant upon how quickly the required documentation can be submitted, reviewed, and accepted. If you choose to work with Lendio for your SBA loan we make it our duty to advance you from application to funding as quickly as possible, regardless of the loan size. Keep in mind that each loan is different, and yours may be difficult or complicated. However, our funding managers know exactly what is required to expedite the SBA loan process, and will help you every step of the way to ensure your funds are processed and received as fast as possible.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Lendio, Inc. has received 3.23 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A-.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Merchant Cash Advance vs. Small Business Loan
 

 





 
Merchant Cash Advance
You can access funding from $5,000 to $300,000. Here’s how it works:


We purchase a set dollar amount of your business’s future credit/debit sales at a discounted price, we pay you this price in a lump sum cash funding.


We collect an agreed upon percentage of each future credit/debit transaction that you process. We do this directly through your processor, or we ACH the amount from your bank.


Your future payments vary based upon your future sales volume— so payments are cash flow friendly!

Small Business Loans
With this solution, you can access funding $5,000 to $500,000. The steps to get funding are easy:


We review your application and your banking and credit card processing history (if applicable) and consult with you on the loan amount, payment, and funding structure


We collect a set daily payment amount from your bank account via ACH debit


Your future payments are fixed so you can plan your future cash flow.
 

 



 
The Merchant Cash Advance Solution
If you have a history of credit card acceptance, then a Merchant Cash Advance may be just what you need. Your history of credit card volume is used to determine the amount of funds that can be advanced. A Merchant Cash Advance requires a minimal operating history and the lowest possible credit requirements. Your payments fluctuate, and are dependent upon the amount of your future credit card sales. The amount that you pay is either collected directly through the daily deposits of your merchant processing account or collected by daily ACH debit to your bank account.
 




 
The Small Business Loan Solution
This solution is ideal for the stronger credit profile, and business with strong consistent cash flow that desires a fixed payment structure. Additionally, the funding amount is not limited by your credit card processing volume. If you have at least 9 months operating history in your business, and prefer a fixed payment structure, then let us quote you a Small Business Loan. Funding time is still about 3 days after submission of your complete application package!

A Business Loan That's Fast and Efficient






By Kari Luckett


































Any type of loan can be a long, drawn-out process. Most adults have had the experience of getting a mortgage, student loan or something as simple as a credit card or auto loan. Anyone that has gotten a mortgage in the last decade has experienced the task of coming up with all the proper paperwork and basically go down to their bank or their broker to provide them with that information.  Then the back and forth process ensues that can be quite lengthy, so inherently, people have this view of lending that it's terribly complicated; and that's what SnapCap is trying to change. 
30-Second Turnaround 
The component pieces SnapCap looks at are credit, credit score of the individual owner (which is a function of any lending decision), time in business -which has a great deal to do with your continuity- and your annual revenue. Naturally, a business that started six months or a year ago is inherently much riskier than one that's been around for two, three or ten years. 
The main value provided to borrowers and that SnapCap does way better than anyone else right now is near-live interaction. Someone who comes to the website, completes an application and provides their basic information is often contacted while still on the website. SnapCap strives to reach out to their users within 30 seconds of the application. It's hard to find that type of customer service anywhere else, in almost any other industry online and offline. 
For example, let's say a business owner visits SnapCap.com and needs $100,000 within a week for a seasonal inventory spike that they may not have anticipated. They're going to fill out a very basic application, provide 90 days' bank data and some additional clarifying information, and they will then be on a fast-track to a loan decision. 
Trust in Lending
SnapCap strives to gain the trust of their applicants before asking for detailed, personal information. "With us, we're looking to provide value to the businesses we give money to, so one thing we found that we do particularly well is we get people on the phone," said Hunter Stunzi, founder of SnapCap. "We have good quality conversations with our customers, educate them on how these loans work, and discuss the upside and value of the loan."
Business owners don't have to worry about SnapCap collecting their social security numbers, tax IDs or other intrusive information when they first apply for a business loan online. "We think it's inappropriate and a lot of our competitors do that," said Stunzi. All the user needs to do initially is provide their basic information and a loan advisor will give them a call to explain the process. At that point, the consumer can decide if it's a right fit for them and how to move forward. 
Borrowers who pay their loans back on time will be pleased to learn that it doesn't go unnoticed. Responsible borrowers may be extended greater benefits in the future in the form of larger loans, longer terms, or something as simple as lower interest rates. The key to any business model is to retain good, quality users.
Behind the Scenes
The technology piece is really the best component of SnapCap's business. Thanks to the digital age where everything is readily available online, consumers can now provide all the required information very fast. Once a tax ID number has been provided, a loan advisor can then do a LexisNexis search and see if the business is in good standing with the secretary of state, if they pay taxes and check if there's anything major or derogatory that might make it irresponsible to approve a loan. 
Once a borrower submits their social security number, SnapCap has a pretty good window into their credit history and who they are as a borrower. Someone who is totally maxed out with all of their trade lines, at risk for bankruptcy, not paying their mortgage, etc., won't be an appropriate borrower. This type of analysis is very important due to the short-term loans that are provided, which are typically 6, 9, 12, and 18-month loans. 
"What we think we've solved is the ability to acquire users online at a very attractive price point relative to our competitors. It's not just because we're able to spend money more efficiently, but we're also interacting with the user in a real-time environment that makes them feel valuable."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
