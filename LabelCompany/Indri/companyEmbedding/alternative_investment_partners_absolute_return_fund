Investment Approach

											Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund (the "Fund") is a fund of hedge funds that invests substantially all its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge funds) that are managed by a select group of alternative investment managers who employ different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of attractive risk-adjusted returns (returns adjusted to take into account volatility of those returns) consistent with the preservation of capital and not highly correlated with fixed income or equity indices.

							Past performance is not indicative of future results.
							
							
								
								
									Growth of investment performance is since the Fund's inception date, based on the net of fees return experience of the Fund. Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees;  2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.50% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% (0.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. Performance links monthly performance through compound multiplication. Results are hypothetical.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS, as applicable, carefully before investing. The prospectus for each of the Funds contains this and other information about the relevant Fund and can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor. Please read the prospectus of the relevant Fund carefully before investing.
Each of the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS is a Delaware statutory trust that issues shares.
Morgan Stanley does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Your clients should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situations.
Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. is a principal underwriter of the Funds. Morgan Stanley is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory services.
Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
Risk Considerations
Alternative investments, like the Absolute Return Fund and the Absolute Return Fund STS are speculative and include a high degree of risk.
Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. The Funds are suitable only for long-term investors willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. The Funds are highly illiquid - there is no secondary market for the shares of these Funds, and there are restrictions on redemptions or assigning or otherwise transferring interests in these Funds. The Funds have higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower the returns achieved by investors. Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. The underlying funds in which the Funds invest (the "Underlying Funds") often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. The Underlying Funds are often unregulated, and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. 
See Risk Factors and Other Considerations for important disclosures. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity and therefore should be viewed as a long-term investment. For a complete description of terms and conditions, fees and other expenses, see the Fund's prospectus.
The Fund is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Fund or shares in the Fund that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Fund. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material. This does not constitute an offer to, or solicitation of, such person or entity.
Benchmark/Index Descriptions
Data provided under the "Financial Indices" sections reflect the most recent data available as of the date this report was produced and is sourced from Bloomberg.
Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees; 2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.50% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% (0.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses.
a Subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV.
b The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses (2.58%), trading expenses (2.26%) and performance-based incentive fees of the Investment Funds in which the Fund was invested (0.81%) for the period ended December 31, 2016. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. Trading expenses are primarily interest and dividend expenses and are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Managers in order to enhance the Investment Funds’ returns. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds’ managers/general partners in the form of management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive allocations generally ranging from 10% to 30% of net profits earned. Some Investment Funds employ a pass-through expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historical fees and expenses. Future Investment Funds’ fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds, which may fluctuate over time.
c The Total Annual Fund Expenses include the Fund’s Management Fee (1.00%), Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (5.65%), Interest Payments on Borrowed Funds (0.51%) and Other Expenses (0.96%).


 









  Subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV.
 





 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Absolute Return Funds




Expand the strategies in a portfolio with absolute return funds, that pursue positive return targets using tools that seek to reduce their risk.
Absolute return funds offer an alternative to more traditional stock, bond, or balanced funds. An absolute return strategy is independent of traditional benchmarks such as the S&P 500 Index or the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which gives it the freedom to invest in a wide variety of securities as well as a variety of strategies to hedge specific types of risk. The funds may have lower volatility over time and are designed to operate independently of market direction. Putnam is the first mutual fund company to offer a suite of four absolute return funds designed for all kinds of investors.
Putnam's approach

We offer a suite of four absolute return funds that may be considered as alternatives to stock funds, bond funds, or balanced funds.
The funds can provide investment diversification as an anchor to any portfolio, and serve as a complement to traditional relative return funds. 
Putnam portfolio managers have experience in managing absolute return strategies over multiple market cycles.

	COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES






	The Underwriter will indemnify the Insured against court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred and paid by the Insured in defense of any legal proceeding brought against the Insured seeking

	Notice hereunder shall be given to Manager, Professional Liability Claims, ICI Mutual Insurance Company, 1401 H St. NW,
	Washington, DC 20005.




	SECTION 5. DISCOVERY




	For all purposes under this Bond, a loss is discovered, and discovery of a loss occurs, when the Insured



	 





	 




	(1)




	becomes aware of facts, or





	 





	 




	(2)




	receives notice of an actual or potential claim by a third party which alleges that the Insured is liable under circumstances,






	which would cause a reasonable person to assume that loss covered by this Bond has been or is likely to be incurred even though the exact amount or
	details of loss may not be known.




	SECTION 6. VALUATION OF PROPERTY




	For the purpose of determining the amount of any loss hereunder, the value of any Property shall be the market value of such Property at the close of business on the first business day before the
	discovery of such loss; except that



	 





	 




	(1)




	the value of any Property replaced by the Insured prior to the payment of a claim therefor shall be the actual market value of such Property at the time of replacement,
	but not in excess of the market value of such Property on the first business day before the discovery of the loss of such Property;






	 



	 




	12










	 




	(2)




	the value of Securities which must be produced to exercise subscription, conversion, redemption or deposit privileges shall be the market value of such privileges
	immediately preceding the expiration thereof if the loss of such Securities is not discovered until after such expiration, but if there is no quoted or other ascertainable market price for such Property or privileges referred to in clauses
	(1) and (2), their value shall be fixed by agreement between the parties or by arbitration before an arbitrator or arbitrators acceptable to the parties; and





	 





	 




	(3)




	the value of books of accounts or other records used by the Insured in the conduct of its business shall be limited to the actual cost of blank books, blank pages or
	other materials if the books or records are reproduced plus the cost of labor for the transcription or copying of data furnished by the Insured for reproduction.






	SECTION 7. LOST SECURITIES




	The maximum liability of the Underwriter hereunder
	for lost Securities shall be the payment for, or replacement of, such Securities having an aggregate value not to exceed the applicable Limit of Liability. If the Underwriter shall make payment to the Insured for any loss of Securities, the Insured
	shall assign to the Underwriter all of the Insureds right, title and interest in and to such Securities. In lieu of such payment, the Underwriter may, at its option, replace such lost Securities, and in such case the Insured shall cooperate to
	effect such replacement. To effect the replacement of lost Securities, the Underwriter may issue or arrange for the issuance of a lost instrument bond. If the value of such Securities does not exceed the applicable Deductible Amount (at the time of
	the discovery






	of the loss), the Insured will pay the usual premium charged for the lost instrument bond and will indemnify the issuer of such bond against all loss and expense that it may sustain because of
	the issuance of such bond.




	If the value of such Securities exceeds the applicable Deductible Amount (at the time of
	discovery of the loss), the Insured will pay a proportion of the usual premium charged for the lost instrument bond, equal to the percentage that the applicable Deductible Amount bears to the value of such Securities upon discovery of the loss, and
	will indemnify the issuer of such bond against all loss and expense that is not recovered from the Underwriter under the terms and conditions of this Bond, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability.




	SECTION 8. SALVAGE




	If any
	recovery is made, whether by the Insured or the Underwriter, on account of any loss within the applicable Limit of Liability hereunder, the Underwriter shall be entitled to the full amount of such recovery to reimburse the Underwriter for all
	amounts paid hereunder with respect to such loss. If any recovery is made, whether by the Insured or the Underwriter, on account of any loss in excess of the applicable Limit of Liability hereunder plus the Deductible Amount applicable to such loss
	from any source other than suretyship, insurance, reinsurance, security or indemnity taken by or for the benefit of the Underwriter, the amount of such recovery, net of the actual costs and expenses of recovery, shall be applied to reimburse the
	Insured in full for the portion of such loss in excess of such Limit of Liability, and the remainder, if any, shall be paid first to reimburse the Underwriter for all amounts paid hereunder with respect to such loss and then to the Insured to the
	extent of the portion of such loss within the Deductible Amount. The Insured shall execute all documents which the Underwriter deems necessary or desirable to secure to the Underwriter the rights provided for herein.




	 



	 




	13








	SECTION 9. NON-REDUCTION AND




	NON-ACCUMULATION OF LIABILITY




	AND TOTAL LIABILITY




	Prior to its termination, this Bond shall continue in force up to the Limit of Liability for each Insuring Agreement for each Single
	Loss, notwithstanding any previous loss (other than such Single Loss) for which the Underwriter may have paid or be liable to pay hereunder; PROVIDED, however, that regardless of the number of years this Bond shall continue in force and the number
	of premiums which shall be payable or paid, the liability of the Underwriter under this Bond with respect to any Single Loss shall be limited to the applicable Limit of Liability irrespective of the total amount of such Single Loss and shall not be
	cumulative in amounts from year to year or from period to period.




	SECTION 10. MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF




	UNDERWRITER; OTHER BONDS OR




	POLICIES




	The maximum liability of the Underwriter for any Single Loss covered
	by any Insuring Agreement under this Bond shall be the Limit of Liability applicable to such Insuring Agreement, subject to the applicable Deductible Amount and the other provisions of this Bond. Recovery for any Single Loss may not be made under
	more than one Insuring Agreement. If any Single Loss covered under this Bond is recoverable or recovered in whole or in part because of an unexpired discovery period under any other bonds or policies issued by the Underwriter to the Insured or to
	any predecessor in interest of the Insured, the maximum liability of the Underwriter shall be the greater of either (1) the applicable Limit of Liability under this Bond, or (2) the maximum liability of the Underwriter under such other
	bonds or policies.






	SECTION 11. OTHER INSURANCE




	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any loss covered by this Bond shall also be covered by other insurance or suretyship for the benefit of the Insured, the Underwriter shall be liable
	hereunder only for the portion of such loss in excess of the amount recoverable under such other insurance or suretyship, but not exceeding the applicable Limit of Liability of this Bond.




	SECTION 12. DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT




	The Underwriter shall not be liable under any
	Insuring Agreement unless the amount of the loss covered thereunder, after deducting the net amount of all reimbursement and/or recovery received by the Insured with respect to such loss (other than from any other bond, suretyship or insurance
	policy or as an advance by the Underwriter hereunder) shall exceed the applicable Deductible Amount; in such case the Underwriter shall be liable only for such excess, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability and the other terms of this Bond.




	No Deductible Amount shall apply to any loss covered under Insuring Agreement A sustained by any Investment Company named as
	an Insured.




	SECTION 13. TERMINATION




	The Underwriter may terminate this Bond as to any Insured or all Insureds only by written notice to such Insured or Insureds and, if this Bond is terminated as to any Investment Company, to each such
	Investment Company terminated thereby and to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C., in all cases not less than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of termination specified in such notice.




	 



	 




	14








	The Insured may terminate this Bond only by written notice to the Underwriter not less
	than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the termination specified in such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the Insured terminates this Bond as to any Investment Company, the effective date of termination shall be not less
	than sixty (60) days from the date the Underwriter provides written notice of the termination to each such Investment Company terminated thereby and to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C.




	This Bond will terminate as to any Insured that is a Non-Fund immediately and without notice upon (1) the takeover of such
	Insureds business by any State or Federal official or agency, or by any receiver or liquidator, or (2) the filing of a petition under any State or Federal statute relative to bankruptcy or reorganization of the Insured, or assignment for
	the benefit of creditors of the Insured.




	Premiums are earned until the effective date of termination. The Underwriter shall
	refund the unearned premium computed at short rates in accordance with the Underwriters standard short rate cancellation tables if this Bond is terminated by the Insured or pro rata if this Bond is terminated by the Underwriter.




	Upon the detection by any Insured that an Employee has committed any Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft, the Insured shall
	immediately remove such Employee from a position that may enable such Employee to cause the Insured to suffer a loss by any subsequent Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft. The Insured, within two (2) business days of such detection, shall
	notify the Underwriter with full and complete particulars of the detected Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft.




	For
	purposes of this section, detection occurs when any partner, officer, or supervisory employee of any Insured, who is not in collusion with such Employee, becomes aware that the Employee has committed any Dishonest or Fraudulent Act(s) or Theft.






	This Bond shall terminate as to any Employee by written notice from the Underwriter to
	each Insured and, if such Employee is an Employee of an Insured Investment Company, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, in all cases not less than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of termination specified in such notice.




	SECTION 14. RIGHTS AFTER TERMINATION




	At any time prior to the effective date of termination of this Bond as to any Insured, such Insured may, by written notice to the Underwriter, elect to purchase the right under this Bond to an additional
	period of twelve (12) months within which to discover loss sustained by such Insured prior to the effective date of such termination and shall pay an additional premium therefor as the Underwriter may require.




	Such additional discovery period shall terminate immediately and without notice upon the takeover of such Insureds business by any
	State or Federal official or agency, or by any receiver or liquidator. Promptly after such termination the Underwriter shall refund to the Insured any unearned premium.




	The right to purchase such additional discovery period may not be exercised by any State or Federal official or agency, or by any receiver or liquidator, acting or appointed to take over the
	Insureds business.




	SECTION 15. CENTRAL HANDLING OF SECURITIES




	The Underwriter shall not be liable for loss in connection with the central handling of securities within the systems established and
	maintained by any Depository (Systems), unless the amount of such




	 



	 




	15








	loss exceeds the amount recoverable or recovered under any bond or policy or participants fund insuring the Depository against such loss (the Depositorys Recovery); in
	such case the Underwriter shall be liable hereunder only for the Insureds share of such excess loss, subject to the applicable Limit of Liability, the Deductible Amount and the other terms of this Bond.




	For determining the Insureds share of such excess loss, (1) the Insured shall be deemed to have an interest in any
	certificate representing any security included within the Systems equivalent to the interest the Insured then has in all certificates representing the same security included within the Systems; (2) the Depository shall have reasonably and
	fairly apportioned the Depositorys Recovery among all those having an interest as recorded by appropriate entries in the books and records of the Depository in Property involved in such loss, so that each such interest shall share in the
	Depositorys Recovery in the ratio that the value of each such interest bears to the total value of all such interests; and (3) the Insureds share of such excess loss shall be the amount of the Insureds interest in such
	Property in excess of the amount(s) so apportioned to the Insured by the Depository.




	This Bond does not afford coverage in
	favor of any Depository or Exchange or any nominee in whose name is registered any security included within the Systems.




	SECTION 16.
	ADDITIONAL COMPANIES INCLUDED AS INSURED




	If more than one entity is named as the Insured:



	 





	 




	A.




	the total liability of the Underwriter hereunder for each Single Loss shall not exceed the Limit of










	 




	Liability which would be applicable if there were only one named Insured, regardless of the number of Insured entities which sustain loss as a result of such Single Loss,





	 





	 




	B.




	the Insured first named in Item 1 of the Declarations shall be deemed authorized to make, adjust, and settle, and receive and enforce payment of, all claims
	hereunder as the agent of each other Insured for such purposes and for the giving or receiving of any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder; provided, that the Underwriter shall promptly furnish each named Insured Investment Company
	with (1) a copy of this Bond and any amendments thereto, (2) a copy of each formal filing of a claim hereunder by any other Insured, and (3) notification of the terms of the settlement of each such claim prior to the execution of such
	settlement,





	 





	 




	C.




	the Underwriter shall not be responsible or have any liability for the proper application by the Insured first named in Item 1 of the Declarations of any payment
	made hereunder to the first named Insured,





	 





	 




	D.




	for the purposes of Sections 4 and 13, knowledge possessed or discovery made by any partner, officer or supervisory Employee of any Insured shall constitute knowledge
	or discovery by every named Insured,





	 





	 




	E.




	if the first named Insured ceases for any reason to be covered under this Bond, then the Insured next named shall thereafter be considered as the first named Insured
	for the purposes of this Bond, and





	 





	 




	F.




	each named Insured shall constitute the Insured for all purposes of this Bond.






	 



	 




	16








	SECTION 17. NOTICE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL




	Within thirty (30) days after learning that there has been a change in control of an Insured by transfer of its outstanding voting
	securities the Insured shall give written notice to the Underwriter of:



	 





	 




	A.




	the names of the transferors and transferees (or the names of the beneficial owners if the voting securities are registered in another name), and





	 





	 




	B.




	the total number of voting securities owned by the transferors and the transferees (or the beneficial owners), both immediately before and after the transfer, and





	 





	 




	C.




	the total number of outstanding voting securities.






	As used in this Section, control means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the Insured.




	SECTION 18. CHANGE OR MODIFICATION




	This Bond may only be modified by written
	Rider forming a part hereof over the signature of the Underwriters authorized representative. Any Rider which modifies the






	coverage provided by Insuring Agreement A, Fidelity, in a manner which adversely affects the rights of an Insured Investment Company shall not become effective until at least sixty (60) days
	after the Underwriter has given written notice thereof to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C., and to each Insured Investment Company affected thereby.




	SECTION 19. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE TRADE AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS




	This Bond
	shall not be deemed to provide any coverage, and the Underwriter shall not be required to pay any loss or provide any benefit hereunder, to the extent that the provision of such coverage, payment of such loss or provision of such benefit would cause
	the Underwriter to be in violation of any applicable trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, any sanctions, laws or regulations administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign
	Assets Control (OFAC).




	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Underwriter has caused this Bond to be executed on the Declarations Page.

	In consideration of the premium charged for this Bond, it is hereby understood and agreed that notwithstanding
	Section 2.Q of this Bond, this Bond is amended by adding an additional Insuring Agreement J as follows:



	 





	 




	J.




	COMPUTER SECURITY






	Loss (including loss of
	Property) resulting directly from Computer Fraud;

	provided

	, that the Insured has adopted in writing and generally maintains and follows during the Bond Period all Computer Security Procedures. The isolated failure of the Insured to maintain
	and follow a particular Computer Security Procedure in a particular instance will not preclude coverage under this Insuring Agreement, subject to the specific exclusions herein and in the Bond.



	 





	 




	1.





	Definitions

	. The following terms used in this Insuring Agreement shall have the following meanings:





	 





	 




	a.




	Authorized User means any person or entity designated by the Insured (through contract, assignment of User Identification, or otherwise) as authorized to
	use a Covered Computer System, or any part thereof. An individual who invests in an Insured Fund shall not be considered to be an Authorized User solely by virtue of being an investor.





	 





	 




	b.




	Computer Fraud means the unauthorized entry of data into, or the deletion or destruction of data in, or change of data elements or programs within, a
	Covered Computer System which:





	 





	 




	(1)




	is committed by any Unauthorized Third Party anywhere, alone or in collusion with other Unauthorized Third Parties;

	and






	 





	 




	(2)




	is committed with the conscious manifest intent (a) to cause the Insured to sustain a loss,

	and

	(b) to obtain financial benefit for the perpetrator or
	any other person;

	and






	 





	 




	(3)




	causes (x) Property to be transferred, paid or delivered;

	or

	(y) an account of the Insured, or of its customer, to be added, deleted, debited or
	credited;

	or

	(z) an unauthorized or fictitious account to be debited or credited.











	 




	c.




	Computer Security Procedures means procedures for prevention of unauthorized computer access and use and administration of computer access and use as
	provided in writing to the Underwriter.





	 





	 




	d.




	Covered Computer System means any Computer System as to which the Insured has possession, custody and control.





	 





	 




	e.




	Unauthorized Third Party means any person or entity that, at the time of the Computer Fraud, is not an Authorized User.





	 





	 




	f.




	User Identification means any unique user name (

	i.e.

	, a series of characters) that is assigned to a person or entity by the Insured.





	 





	 




	2.





	Exclusions

	. It is further understood and agreed that this Insuring Agreement J shall not cover:





	 





	 




	a.




	Any loss covered under Insuring Agreement A, Fidelity, of this Bond;

	and






	 





	 




	b.




	Any loss resulting directly or indirectly from Theft or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, material or data (including but not limited to
	trade secrets, computer programs or customer information);

	and






	 





	 




	c.




	Any loss resulting from the intentional failure to adhere to one or more Computer Security Procedures;

	and






	 





	 




	d.




	Any loss resulting from a Computer Fraud committed by or in collusion with:





	 





	 




	(1)




	any Authorized User (whether a natural person or an entity);

	or






	 





	 




	(2)




	in the case of any Authorized User which is an entity, (a) any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of such Authorized User, or (b) any entity which
	controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Authorized User (Related Entity), or (c) any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of such Related Entity;

	or






	 





	 




	(3)




	in the case of any Authorized User who is a natural person, (a) any entity for which such Authorized User is a director, officer, partner, employee or agent
	(Employer Entity), or (b) any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of such Employer Entity, or (c) any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such Employer Entity
	(Employer-Related Entity), or (d) any director, officer, partner, employee or agent of such Employer-Related Entity;







	and




	 





	 




	e.




	Any loss resulting from physical damage to or destruction of any Covered Computer System, or any part thereof, or any data, data elements or media associated therewith;

	and












	 




	f.

	this Bond, shall also include all loss caused by Computer Fraud(s) committed by one person, or in which one person is implicated, whether or not that person is specifically identified. A series of losses involving unidentified individuals, but
	arising from the same method of operation, may be deemed by the Underwriter to involve the same individual and in that event shall be treated as a Single Loss.




	It is further understood and agreed that nothing in this Rider shall affect the exclusion set forth in Section 2.O of this Bond.




	Coverage under this Insuring Agreement shall terminate upon termination of this Bond. Coverage under this Insuring Agreement may also be terminated without terminating this Bond as an entirety:

	Most property and casualty insurers, including ICI Mutual Insurance Company, a Risk Retention Group (ICI
	Mutual), are subject to the requirements of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended (the Act). The Act establishes a federal insurance backstop under which ICI Mutual and these other insurers will be partially
	reimbursed for future

	insured losses

	resulting from certified

	acts of terrorism.

	(Each of these

	bolded terms

	is defined by the Act.) The Act also places certain disclosure and other obligations on ICI
	Mutual and these other insurers.




	Pursuant to the Act, any future losses to ICI Mutual caused by certified

	acts of
	terrorism

	will be partially reimbursed by the United States government under a formula established by the Act. Under this formula, the United States government will reimburse ICI Mutual for the Federal Share of Compensation of ICI
	Mutuals

	insured losses

	in excess of ICI Mutuals

	insurer deductible

	until total

	insured losses

	of all participating insurers in excess of a statutorily established aggregate
	deductible reach the Cap on Annual Liability. If total

	insured losses

	of all property and casualty insurers in excess of a statutorily established aggregate deductible reach the Cap on Annual Liability during any applicable period,
	the Act provides that the insurers will not be liable under their policies for their portions of such losses that exceed such amount. Amounts otherwise payable under this policy may be reduced as a result.




	This policy has no express exclusion for

	acts of terrorism.

	However, coverage under this policy remains subject to all applicable
	terms, conditions and limitations of the policy (including exclusions) that are permissible under the Act. The portion of the premium that is attributable to any coverage potentially available under the policy for

	acts of
	terrorism

	is one percent (1%).




	As used herein, Federal Share of Compensation shall mean:




	85% in calendar year 2015;




	84% in calendar year 2016;




	83% in calendar year 2017;




	82% in calendar year 2018;




	81% in calendar year 2019; and




	80% in calendar year 2020.







	As used herein, Cap on Annual Liability shall mean, with respect to total

	insured
	losses

	of all participating insurers:




	$100 billion in calendar year 2015;




	$120 billion in calendar year 2016;




	$140 billion in calendar year 2017;




	$160 billion in calendar year 2018;

 Morgan Stanley Investment Management announced today that it has launched the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund ("Absolute Return Fund"), a fund of hedge funds that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 which offers an institutional-quality portfolio of hedge funds to eligible individual investors and smaller institutional clients.  For a relatively low minimum initial investment of $100,000, and $50,000 for additional purchases, accredited investors have access to the established track record and skills of Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners' investment team. The group, founded in April 2000, manages portfolios of hedge funds and private equity assets for some of the world's largest institutions and high net worth individuals.  The Absolute Return Fund's management team is led by Mustafa Jama, Head and Chief Investment Officer of Liquid Markets of Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners. Employing an "absolute return strategy," the Fund seeks to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns over the broad range of market environments. In addition, the fund of hedge funds structure may potentially lower portfolio risk by diversifying across a broad number of funds and strategies.  "Launching the Absolute Return Fund is a natural way for us to utilize our experience and relationships in the hedge fund industry to bring more sophisticated products to a greater number of our clients," said Stuart Bohart, Head of Alternative Investments of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. "The Absolute Return Fund is an attractive option for investors who are looking to generate returns that are independent of traditional markets."

Morgan Stanley Investment Management Launches the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS (''Absolute Return Fund STS''); Absolute Return Fund STS Demonstrates Further Enhancement of Alternative Investment Offerings | Business Wire


























































Morgan Stanley Investment Management Launches the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund STS (''Absolute Return Fund STS''); Absolute Return Fund STS Demonstrates Further Enhancement of Alternative Investment Offerings






August 07, 2006 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



				NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 7, 2006--Morgan Stanley Investment Management ("MSIM") announced today that it has launched the Absolute Return Fund STS, an institutional-quality portfolio of hedge funds for special tax status investors, namely, tax-exempt and tax-deferred individual investors and smaller institutional clients. Expanding on the April 2006 launch of the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund ("Absolute Return Fund") available to taxable investors, the Absolute Return Fund STS now allows the SEC-registered fund of hedge fund offerings of Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners ("Morgan Stanley AIP") to be available to investors with taxable, tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts.  With the launch of the Absolute Return Fund STS, tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts, such as endowment funds, certain trust accounts and IRAs that are accredited investors, have access to hedge fund returns without incurring any unrelated business tax income (UBTI) as a result of the hedge fund investments made by Absolute Return Fund. The Absolute Return Fund and Absolute Return Fund STS (together, the "Funds") give investors access to the expertise and established track record of Morgan Stanley AIP for the relatively low minimum initial investment of $100,000. 

 Morgan Stanley AIP, founded in April 2000, manages portfolios of hedge funds and private equity assets for some of the world's largest institutions and high net worth individuals. The Funds are managed by Morgan Stanley AIP's Liquid Markets Team, headed by Mustafa Jama.  "We are excited to bring the expertise of Morgan Stanley AIP to even more of our clients," said Michael Kiley, Head of Americas Retail and Intermediary Distribution. "By filling out the product offering for the absolute return strategy to include tax-exempt and tax-deferred accounts, we're continuing to provide innovative solutions to accommodate individual investors' growing demand for a practical entry into the hedge fund marketplace."  The Absolute Return Fund STS is an SEC-registered vehicle that utilizes the same "absolute return strategy" utilized by the Absolute Return Fund to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns over the broad range of market environments - but without the investment activity of the Absolute Return Fund giving rise to any UBTI.  "The Absolute Return Fund STS leverages the attractiveness of the Absolute Return Fund, while ensuring that UBTI is not ultimately incurred by the investor as a result of the Absolute Return Fund's investment activities," said Stuart Bohart, Head of Alternative Investments of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. "The launch of the Absolute Return Fund STS is a natural progression in our efforts to expand our sophisticated product offerings in the alternatives space and also meet the needs of our clients."
