COMPANY OVERVIEW
	Headwaters is a leading manufacturer of building products for the residential construction, residential remodeling, commercial and institutional construction industries.  The Company’s portfolio of building products includes: architectural stone; resin-based exterior siding accessories (such as specialty siding and shutters); roofing; trim board; decking; railing; concrete block and brick; windows; and various other building products. The Company has over 1,000 wholesale distributors in the U.S., mainly one-step and two-step distributors; and generates incremental sales through big box stores. Headwaters also markets certain products through its direct sales force. The broad distribution system and extraordinary brand loyalty has enabled Headwaters to capture leadership positions in its key niche product categories.

	Headwaters is the largest manager and marketer of coal combustion products in the construction materials industry. The primary focus of its construction materials segment is to recycle high quality fly ash into a replacement for portland cement. Fly ash is used in virtually every concrete application, making it one of the most widely-used construction materials in the United States.

	Headwaters’ focus on transforming underutilized resources into valuable products has helped the Company capitalize on the increasing demand for building materials that contribute to sustainability. Headwaters’ fly ash business is a perfect example of sustainability. Fly ash is a by-product of burning coal at electric generating power plants and is generally disposed of if not recycled. Headwaters markets fly ash as a cement substitute that enhances the quality of concrete structures, reduces the need for virgin raw materials, reduces CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Because the use of fly ash produces a stronger, more durable concrete, the majority of this product is used in building infrastructure projects such as: roads, bridges, and highways. It is one of America’s greatest recycling success stories.

	Headwaters also operates an Energy Technology segment that deploys breakthrough technologies that improve natural resource utilization.  Headwaters' HCAT® technology is a proprietary, patented catalyst that improves residue hydrocracking, creating a higher conversion to a lighter distillate such as diesel and gasoline.

CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
	Headwaters' Construction Materials segment represents the largest distributor of coal combustion products (CCPs), primarily fly ash, in the U.S. today.  Through the acquisition of Synthetic Materials LLC (SYNMAT) in fiscal 2016, Headwaters has also become a leader in the processing and managing of synthetic gypsum in the country.  Both fly ash and synthetic gypsum are by-products that are produced by burning coal at electric utility plants.  High quality fly ash is used primarily as a replacement for portland cement when producing concrete, and synthetic gypsum is used mainly in the production of wallboard products.  

	Beginning in the December 2016 quarter, Headwaters' regional Texas block business, Headwaters Concrete Products, was moved from Headwaters' Building Products segment into Headwaters' Construction Materials segment.  The rationale behind the move was to form a cross-functioning team that can identify and leverage synergies and expertise that will reduce costs, increase operating margins, and increase profitability.
