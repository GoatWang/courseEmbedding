FSI Announces an Increase in Second Quarter Revenue


Victoria, British Columbia (FSCwire) – FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (MKT(AMEX): FSI, FRANKFURT: FXT), is the developer and manufacturer of biodegradable polymers for oil extraction, detergent ingredients and water treatment as well as crop nutrient availability chemistry. Flexible Solutions also manufactures biodegradable and environmentally safe water and energy conservation technologies. Today the Company announces a year over year Increase in revenues for second quarter (Q2) 2017.
Sales were higher in Q2, 2017 than in Q2, 2016. Flexible Solutions’ top line revenue increased from $3.73 million (Q2, 2016) to $4.72 million (Q2, 2017), up approximately 27% year over year.
CEO Dan O’Brien states, “General growth in our NanoChem division coincided with receipt of agriculture sales that were delayed from Q1, to result in good revenue growth for the quarter. We have recovered all the revenue lost from the Taber fire”. Mr. O’Brien continues, ”We believe that we may be able to carry the growth achieved in Q2 on into Q3 and Q4 but, perhaps, at a slightly lower rate. This news release is also the appropriate time for me to say how proud the Company is of our employees who have rebounded so quickly from the fire, which would have slowed a lesser team. Thank you.”
Complete financial results will be available on August 14, 2017 concurrent with the Company’s SEC quarterly filings. A conference call will be scheduled for 8:00 am Pacific Time, 11:00 am Eastern Standard Time, the following day, August 15. See the FSI August 14, 2017 financials news release for the dial in numbers.

Flexible Solutions’ top line revenue increased from $3.73 million (Q2, 2016) to $4.72 million (Q2, 2017), up approximately 27% year over year.CEO, Dan O’Brien, states, “General growth in our NanoChem division coincided with receipt of agriculture sales that were delayed from Q1, to result in good revenue growth for the quarter. We have recovered all the revenue lost from the Taber fire.” Mr. O’Brien continues, “We believe that we may be able to carry the growth achieved in Q2 on into Q3 and Q4 but, perhaps, at a slightly lower rate.

      We are an environmental technology company involved in research, development and manufacturing of products that increase crop yield, improve oil and gas operations, reduce the environmental footprint in cleaning and water treatment, save water and save energy.
Various 
        scientific trials done by water authorities in Australia, Singapore, Turkey and 
      USA using WaterSavr™
led to evaporation saving between 30% to 35% of water loss 
      from open water storage and transport
 systems.

 Furthermore, modifications of the same technology allow our swimming pool products to save up to 45% of a pool's energy use in addition to the water savings. In 2004 we bought the assets of Donlar Corp, formed NanoChem Solutions and rapidly built our new products to more than 90% of total sales.
All of our products are safe, organic and biodegrade quickly into harmless byproducts. We at Flexible Solutions are proud to contribute positively to the planet with our focus on conservation and the environment, concurrent with running a successful, growing business.

The History of Ecosavr







The History of Ecosavr™ 

 In 1997, Dan O’Brien, President of Flexible Solutions invented a flexible bag dispensing system that made it possible to deploy a liquid pool blanket for a whole month by simply cutting off a portion and placing the flexible container in the pool.
 
Mr. O’Brien filed a patent application in the U.S. for his unique system in 1998 and it was issued in 2000. It is assigned to Flexible Solutions. From 1998 until February 2004, Flexible Solutions manufactured their invention for Sunsolar Energy Technologies,  which was sold under Sunsolar’s trade-mark Tropical Fish®*.
 
On February 29th 2004, Flexible Solutions discontinued manufacture of Tropical Fish®* for Sunsolar Energy Technologies, and started making and selling a new and improved version of the invention, under Flexible Solutions’ own brand, Ecosavr™. The name Ecosavr™ was chosen as being appropriate for the product’s purpose – Eco for Ecologically friendly and savr for the water, energy and time it saves for the pool owner.
 
The liquid solar cover contained in Ecosavr™ is Heatsavr™, Flexible Solutions’ commercial liquid pool cover. Heatsavr has been on the market for 16 years and led directly to the invention of Ecosavr in 1998. The two products have 24 years of combined market experience. Flexible Solutions is the only liquid blanket manufacturer with any published safety and efficacy data.  Flexible Solutions, Heatsavr and Ecosavr are the “World Leaders” for liquid blankets on indoor pools and liquid solar covers for outdoor pools.
 
Dan O’Brien, President
 
*Tropical Fish® is a registered trademark of Sunsolar Energy Technologies

For over fifty years, scientists have known that a monolayer (one molecule thick) spread across the surface of a liquid can dramatically reduce evaporation and energy loss. Many companies attempted to develop a technology, but until FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. (Flexible Solutions or the Company), no other company had been able to make a monolayer spread reliably and inexpensively.
Flexible Solutions is engaged in developing, manufacturing and selling innovative, proprietary environmental technologies that simultaneously reduce water evaporation and energy consumption.  This technology can be applied to swimming pools, open fresh water surfaces of all kinds and agricultural land.

Flexible Solutions International - Delving Deeper Into Its WaterSavr Product - Flexible Solutions International, Inc (NYSEMKT:FSI) | Seeking Alpha 
Sign in / Join NowGO»
Amit GhateLong/short equity, valueFlexible Solutions International - Delving Deeper Into Its WaterSavr ProductI recently wrote an article summarizing why I'm long Flexible Solutions International (NYSEMKT:FSI). The basic reason given was that FSI is fairly valued on its agricultural products alone, but with the Western drought worsening (and thereby receiving much more news coverage) sales of FSI's WaterSavr product might cause the company's value to increase substantially.
In the comments to the article one reader (Faisal) asked several important questions which hadn't been covered in the article, but which should be addressed to make a full investment case. In following sections I'll try to address his points along with a few others.
What's Special About WaterSavr?
1. Patented Mechanism of Action
WaterSavr's mechanism of action is to create a chemical "monolayer"...

For over fifty years, scientists have known that a monolayer (one molecule thick) spread across the surface of a liquid can dramatically reduce evaporation and energy loss. Many companies attempted to develop a technology, but until FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. (Flexible Solutions or the Company), no other company had been able to make a monolayer spread reliably and inexpensively.
Flexible Solutions is engaged in developing, manufacturing and selling innovative, proprietary environmental technologies that simultaneously reduce water evaporation and energy consumption.  This technology can be applied to swimming pools, open fresh water surfaces of all kinds and agricultural land.

The Drought Crisis: Flexible Solutions International Has A Product To Slow Water Evaporation - Flexible Solutions International, Inc (NYSEMKT:FSI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Drought Crisis: Flexible Solutions International Has A Product To Slow Water EvaporationJul.22.14 | About: Flexible Solutions (FSI) super-trades Long/short equity, Deep Value, value, special situationsSuper-TradesSummaryMany parts of the Western United States are undergoing a drought crisis due to dry conditions.FSI is the developer of WaterSavr, the world’s first commercially viable water evaporation retardant that reduces evaporation by up to 30%.On July 16, 2014, FSI announced that The City of Wichita Falls, Texas has approved a project to apply WaterSavr to the Lake Arrowhead Reservoir.Many parts of the Western United States are undergoing a drought crisis due to dry conditions. Experts warn that this crisis may worsen. Besides conservation and rationing the use of water, one other line of defense is the evaporation of water. Drought occurs when evaporation from increased temperatures greatly exceed precipitation for a prolonged period.
UCLA Water Resources Group Director Madelyn Glickfeld broke down the state's water system. "Only about a third of L.A.'s water comes from local sources. The rest is siphoned in from elsewhere. Hauling all this water, she said is the biggest electricity use in California. Moreover she said, we lose a lot of it through evaporation."
Flexible Solutions International (NYSEMKT:FSI) is the developer of WaterSavr, the world's first commercially viable water evaporation retardant. WaterSavr reduces evaporation by up to 30% on reservoirs, lakes, aqueducts, irrigation canals, ponds and slow moving rivers. Heatsavr, a "liquid blanket" evaporation retardant for the commercial swimming pool and spa markets, reduces energy costs by 15% to 40% and can result in reduced indoor pool humidity. The company's Ecosavr product targets the residential swimming pool market providing the same savings as Heatsavr.
On July 16, 2014 FSI announced that The City of Wichita Falls, Texas has approved a project to apply WaterSavr to the Lake Arrowhead Reservoir that supplies the City of Wichita Falls. WaterSavr is an evaporation reduction aid that has significantly reduced water loss in multiple studies around the world. It is approved for use in the USA by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) under Schedule 60. WaterSavr is 100% biodegradable and composed of only food grade ingredients. It is made in the USA. In several studies, it has reduced evaporation from reservoirs by more than 30%. Evaporation is the largest form of water loss suffered by reservoirs in the region and it has been calculated that if Wichita Falls can save 10% of the water that normally evaporates each year, the saving would be greater than 1/3 of its annual consumption by the city of the year. A 75-day summer supply that would cost about $400,000.

For fiscal year 2013, after removing items not related to current operations FSI shows positive operating cash flow of $533,407 or $0.04 per share. The NanoChem division continues to be the dominant source of revenue and cash flow for the company. New opportunities continue to unfold in detergent, water treatment, oil field extraction and agricultural use to further increase sales in this division.
Risks include the industry adoption of products and the application challenges. However, having successful wins like Wichita Falls would seem to serve as selling and marketing proof to win other sales. Additionally, FSI has a tradeable float of approximately 6.8 million shares. Low float stocks can be subject to extreme and rapid moves.
With the drought crisis only threatening to worsen worldwide, in my opinion, the FSI evaporation retardant product has the potential to become a strong weapon in the fight against this severe problem.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
