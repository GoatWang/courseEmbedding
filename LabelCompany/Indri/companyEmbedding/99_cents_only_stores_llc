About Us 
99 Cents Only Stores is a premier deep-discount retailer that primarily carries name-brand consumable and general merchandise.
We are an exciting shopping destination—often the first stop—for price-sensitive consumers, and a fun treasure-hunt shopping experience for other value conscious consumers.
Our stores are attractively merchandised, clean, full-service shopping destinations that offer customers significant value on a wide selection of quality products from everyday household items to fresh produce to an exciting assortment of seasonal and party merchandise including decorations, costumes and gifts. Merchandise encompasses name-brand closeouts and regularly available food and beverage products such as produce, deli, and other basic grocery items.
From the first store opening in 1982, 99 Cents Only Stores has expanded to more than 350 extreme value retail stores in California, Texas, Arizona, and Nevada.
History99 Cents Only Stores dates back to the 1960’s when the company’s founder, Dave Gold, inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown Los Angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed price-point of 99 cents. The test was instant success, and Dave thought that selling everything in the store for 99 cents would be hugely popular.He finally put this idea to work in 1982, when he spotted a building for lease and decided it would be a great location for the first 99 Cents Only Stores.On “lucky” Friday, the 13th of August in 1982, Dave and Sherry Gold opened the first 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles. To celebrate the Grand Opening, Dave decided to sell television sets for only 99 cents to the store’s first 9 customers. More than 300 people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open. The huge line caught the media’s attention, and more than 10 TV outlets covered the store’s first day. The success of this first grand opening inspired a tradition that continues today, with every new store offering incredible 99-cent deals for televisions and other exciting products.Over the years, the Company grew with new stores in California, and after the Company went public in 1996, 99 Cents Only Stores began opening locations in new markets including Arizona, Nevada and Texas.99 Cents Only Stores secured its place in history and as an iconic American institution when the famous German photographer Andreas Gursky captured a world-renowned image of the inside of the 99 Cents Only store in Hollywood in 1999. That picture was featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and was later auctioned off by Sotheby’s for more than $3 million, setting the all-time sales price record for a photograph!With more than 350 stores in four states and two distribution centers in California and Texas, 99 Cents Only Stores became the leading extreme value retail chain in the Western United States.2012 marked a turning point for the Company when it celebrated its 30th anniversary and decided to go private by partnering with Ares Management and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.  This partnership has been instrumental in the company’s continued expansion, both in the number of new stores and new markets. It’s an exciting time at 99 Cents Only Stores. We’re opening new stores and arriving in new markets to ensure we provide our customers with the best values!

I was driving Mom around on Mother's Day and she just had to have the tamarind mango candy her coworker kept raving about. This place was actually out of the way but Mom's gotta have what she wants on her special day (who am I kidding, any day she wants). They say it tastes just like a mangonada and serving size is similarly one for that three bite morsel packed with calories and sugar. Take slow bites and savor that salty spicy flavor. 

I'll be honest, I was just here for candy. I found Haribo gummy bears both single bag and individually wrapped treat bags ($1.99). Go here for piñata stuffers! Lots of tootsie pops, blow pops, bubble gum, etc.

Lots of brand name candy and mints at the counters too.
Staff is friendly! They do sell produce, not sure if it's GMO though.







This store rocks. The employees are really friendly and helpful. Alex D, Jason and all of the rest are doing an excellent job.







This is my favorite store for produce.  Especially artichokes and avocados.  Fresh bread of all kinds. On my social security income this is excellent.







This store will save I money!!.  They have everything u need.  Groceries, alcohol, and all life necessities.







Great store, fully equipped with just about everything you need for just about anything, always fresh bread and produce, every single staff is kind and courteous and the store manager Alex P. does a wonderful job at making sure the store is kept tidy and in order...I go here almost everyday for something!







Ok...so, I knew the 99 Cent stores existed and people shop there. However, I didn't really get into it until my good friend took me to the store in San Leandro! It was huge and had groceries! Ummm...groceries as in fruits and veggies! Milk, eggs, deli meats, and snacks! Wow! Ok, you got me 99 Cent! 
I decided to try out this location and saw the lack of reviews. Why not add one more! 
The store itself was kept clean and stocked. 
It's like any other groceries stores, just without the bakery, butcher and the occasional Starbucks. However, the added bonus is that probably 90% of the items are 99 cents! You will find some items in the $2 range. I haven't seen anything over $3. Those items are usually bulk TP, eggs or milk. Still, if you're under a budget- that's mega savings!! And yes, you will find BRAND names at the 99 Cents store. Oh! This store...carries wine- if you're a wine drinker. On today's visit, I spent $32.09! And guess how many items I left the store with? Guess! 32 Items!!! I bought 9 gigantic green mangos for 99 cents each!!! If I was at Safeway, they would have cost $2.50 each and half the size! My receipt for this same purchase would have been somewhere between $80-$100 at Safeway. 
I guess you can agree that I'm a fan of this 99 Cent Only Stores, location and San Leandro's!







In general I love 99 cent only stores, including this one in Fremont. I shopped pretty much every other few days in this store.

There are few things that you have to get yourself familiar with if you shop in 99 cent only stores. Their stuffs usually are in low quality (you get what you pay for) so this is a non-issue to me. Another thing to look out is their return policies. In general, their stuffs is returnable within 7 days, but sometimes they have very vague policies on the terms of seasonal items.

I have trouble returning Christmas gift cards to the store even the store manager had promised me I would have no problem returning it. And they just denied my returns and the manager was never show up in the store every time I went visiting.

The cashiers and head of cashiers took my phone information three times and told me they would have the store manager to contact me but no one gave me any reply after. The first two times I went there, there was this Hispanic dude that kinda lead the store told me the manager was not there, so he asked me to leave me my information, I did, but no follow up. I went there the 3rd time, the cashier Jason, the head of cashier, Joraliza (I hope I spelt it correctly) did the same thing and no one follow up after.

So in general, don't trust what their cashiers would told you because they don't care and they wouldn't be able to help you while you have problems. They always referred you to the store manger who just never showed up in the store.







I like a good bargain when I see it. With that said, I'll gladly take the 99 cent store over Safeway, Whole foods, trader joes anyday! This store has some great items ranging from snack items too frozen foods. In terms of candy, they got all the nestle brands and russell stovers to name a few! I recently purchased stoufer's buffalo mac cheese cheese cups, Silk brand cashew milk, and progresso pasta bowls! Some of the items you find at this store are actually hard to find at the bigger chains. My only issue is that items constantly change. One week your find what you want and the next, that item is no more on display. For this reason, I hoard upon my favorite snacks and grab more than 1 just to be safe! One thing to keep in mind when shopping here is too look at the expiration date. Ive seen some dairy products that expired over a year ago but was still on the shelf!







Impressive store. Good verity. Fresh foods have great prices. My husband worked food stores and he's pleased. Always go for treats, they beat movie theater prices! Corn nuts, peanuts and the like are fresh. Everyday items are plentiful. Try it out!







In love with this store. Relatively clean for a store of this type, great savings and quality. Love to buy produce,frozen foods,snacks,spices,monster energy drinks,brand name makeup,and brand name toys here!







I remember when this was a Safeway, then a Smart & Final.

First impression ...... packed with stuff!

Most of the stuff was brands I didn't recognize .... that's ok!

There's a little of everything.

Won't be in my regular rotation, but I'll stop when nearby.







Love this store! We always have great experiences here as far as staff.... customers, meh, they're rude! Oh well, we get great deals; I can deal with the azzholes because the employees / Mgrs are fantastic, especially Alex D, AWESOME MANAGER! She is personable and very likeable! I will continue to shop here as long as it doesn't change and get stupid! ;)







99 cents only store actually sells most items for $1.they usually have more snack items available then dollar tree. line was long until 2 more cashiers were called up front.

buys:: white chocolate flavored pringles(1)
-artifically flavored, tasty
pop corners(1)
-ny. based, tastier than popchips
-got kettle, cheesy jalapeno, white cheddar, chili

crumbs:
-parking lot full.







When I went to purchase my items, it seems that someone put an empty open scissor container ( like someone stole the item inside but left behind the plastic outline and barcode backing attached in my bag) and had me pay for it. I didn't realize it until I checked my bag and noticed the empty item package and that I was also charged on my receipt. I was obviously too busy getting my card out to pay .. But seriously, how does the cashier not notice an empty plastic thing and still decide to process it through? 
Disappointing







This is by far the best 99 cent store in Fremont or any other place I have been to. The selection is enormous. Watermelons, Epsom Salt, hats, earphones, towels, wine (usually $2.99), milk ($2.99 a gallon), bacon, chicken, potato chips. It is entirely possible to get all your household good here, but there is also quite a lot of cheap junk. Despite that, unlike most 99 cent stores, you can find a lot of merchandise that goes for $4.99 or more at other stores. I have seen 5oz tins of wild salmon, large artichokes, and 15 pound watermelons.







Went to this 99 Cents Only Store since it was across the street from Green Champa Garden.

Got a bunch of stuff:

Halsa pocket pack facial tissue 8pack of 3ply tissues
Bath Wipes - good for camping with no showers
Tuna w/ crackers 
3 grapefruits pre-bagged 

Charged it.







I couldn't my eyes when I walked into this store. Nearly everything was $0.99!!! They sell a lot of random knick knacks and generic looking groceries for $0.99 too. I even saw brand name sun screen for $0.99!!! I was blown away by their variety of random cheap goodies. I go to their IG page and see that they always have good and new stuff and to my surprise it's good stuff like Golden Peak tea and more!! I don't come here often but when I do I always leave with a bag full of goodies. I even bought flip flops for $0.99 lol. They have everything it seems. I'm excited to come back here because it's hard to say no to cheap goodies and groceries lol. Store is clean and not cheap looking. Kinda reminds me of Big Lots but cheaper because almost everything is $0.99. I am a huge fan and I wish they would expand and have more locations. I know that some location even carry organic groceries!!! Can't beat that!!!







Found this place in Fremont, went in to check it out an buy some reading glasses. Jack pot, bought 10 pair. 
The place is very clean , organized. I even bought produce , rasberries, 99/box.
Great little place in fremont







They have a good selection of veggies and fruits here. Sometimes, their veggies and fruits rotate so if I was specifically looking for something I wouldn't count on them to have it 100% of the time. They have started selling milk here (not for $0.99 though), so if I need I can get some here. 

There is always a steady stream of customers coming in and out; the checkout is quick and the cashiers are friendly. Parking is usually not a problem.







This is a basic 99 cent store. Relatively small and somewhat cluttered and unkept feeling. I don't want to totally hammer the place because there are some nice little snags here and there, just don't expect diamond in the rough lifetime merchandise here. 

I find it quite nice to run over to the store and pick up some big size candy boxes of candy. They have lots of candy that is cheap and its great! 

I shall continue to patron this store.

I was driving Mom around on Mother's Day and she just had to have the tamarind mango candy her coworker kept raving about. This place was actually out of the way but Mom's gotta have what she wants on her special day (who am I kidding, any day she wants). They say it tastes just like a mangonada and serving size is similarly one for that three bite morsel packed with calories and sugar. Take slow bites and savor that salty spicy flavor. I'll be honest, I was just here for candy. I found Haribo gummy bears both single bag and individually wrapped treat bags ($1.99). Go here for piñata stuffers! Lots of tootsie pops, blow pops, bubble gum, etc.Lots of brand name candy and mints at the counters too.Staff is friendly! They do sell produce, not sure if it's GMO though.

Ok...so, I knew the 99 Cent stores existed and people shop there. However, I didn't really get into it until my good friend took me to the store in San Leandro! It was huge and had groceries! Ummm...groceries as in fruits and veggies! Milk, eggs, deli meats, and snacks! Wow! Ok, you got me 99 Cent! I decided to try out this location and saw the lack of reviews. Why not add one more! The store itself was kept clean and stocked. It's like any other groceries stores, just without the bakery, butcher and the occasional Starbucks. However, the added bonus is that probably 90% of the items are 99 cents! You will find some items in the $2 range. I haven't seen anything over $3. Those items are usually bulk TP, eggs or milk. Still, if you're under a budget- that's mega savings!! And yes, you will find BRAND names at the 99 Cents store. Oh! This store...carries wine- if you're a wine drinker. On today's visit, I spent $32.09! And guess how many items I left the store with? Guess! 32 Items!!! I bought 9 gigantic green mangos for 99 cents each!!! If I was at Safeway, they would have cost $2.50 each and half the size! My receipt for this same purchase would have been somewhere between $80-$100 at Safeway. I guess you can agree that I'm a fan of this 99 Cent Only Stores, location and San Leandro's!

In general I love 99 cent only stores, including this one in Fremont. I shopped pretty much every other few days in this store.There are few things that you have to get yourself familiar with if you shop in 99 cent only stores. Their stuffs usually are in low quality (you get what you pay for) so this is a non-issue to me. Another thing to look out is their return policies. In general, their stuffs is returnable within 7 days, but sometimes they have very vague policies on the terms of seasonal items.I have trouble returning Christmas gift cards to the store even the store manager had promised me I would have no problem returning it. And they just denied my returns and the manager was never show up in the store every time I went visiting.The cashiers and head of cashiers took my phone information three times and told me they would have the store manager to contact me but no one gave me any reply after. The first two times I went there, there was this Hispanic dude that kinda lead the store told me the manager was not there, so he asked me to leave me my information, I did, but no follow up. I went there the 3rd time, the cashier Jason, the head of cashier, Joraliza (I hope I spelt it correctly) did the same thing and no one follow up after.So in general, don't trust what their cashiers would told you because they don't care and they wouldn't be able to help you while you have problems. They always referred you to the store manger who just never showed up in the store.

I like a good bargain when I see it. With that said, I'll gladly take the 99 cent store over Safeway, Whole foods, trader joes anyday! This store has some great items ranging from snack items too frozen foods. In terms of candy, they got all the nestle brands and russell stovers to name a few! I recently purchased stoufer's buffalo mac cheese cheese cups, Silk brand cashew milk, and progresso pasta bowls! Some of the items you find at this store are actually hard to find at the bigger chains. My only issue is that items constantly change. One week your find what you want and the next, that item is no more on display. For this reason, I hoard upon my favorite snacks and grab more than 1 just to be safe! One thing to keep in mind when shopping here is too look at the expiration date. Ive seen some dairy products that expired over a year ago but was still on the shelf!








Deliciousness...Found these speciality crunch bars! Only there for a limited time so got 30 of them.

Love this store! We always have great experiences here as far as staff.... customers, meh, they're rude! Oh well, we get great deals; I can deal with the azzholes because the employees / Mgrs are fantastic, especially Alex D, AWESOME MANAGER! She is personable and very likeable! I will continue to shop here as long as it doesn't change and get stupid! ;)

When I went to purchase my items, it seems that someone put an empty open scissor container ( like someone stole the item inside but left behind the plastic outline and barcode backing attached in my bag) and had me pay for it. I didn't realize it until I checked my bag and noticed the empty item package and that I was also charged on my receipt. I was obviously too busy getting my card out to pay .. But seriously, how does the cashier not notice an empty plastic thing and still decide to process it through? Disappointing

This is by far the best 99 cent store in Fremont or any other place I have been to. The selection is enormous. Watermelons, Epsom Salt, hats, earphones, towels, wine (usually $2.99), milk ($2.99 a gallon), bacon, chicken, potato chips. It is entirely possible to get all your household good here, but there is also quite a lot of cheap junk. Despite that, unlike most 99 cent stores, you can find a lot of merchandise that goes for $4.99 or more at other stores. I have seen 5oz tins of wild salmon, large artichokes, and 15 pound watermelons.

I couldn't my eyes when I walked into this store. Nearly everything was $0.99!!! They sell a lot of random knick knacks and generic looking groceries for $0.99 too. I even saw brand name sun screen for $0.99!!! I was blown away by their variety of random cheap goodies. I go to their IG page and see that they always have good and new stuff and to my surprise it's good stuff like Golden Peak tea and more!! I don't come here often but when I do I always leave with a bag full of goodies. I even bought flip flops for $0.99 lol. They have everything it seems. I'm excited to come back here because it's hard to say no to cheap goodies and groceries lol. Store is clean and not cheap looking. Kinda reminds me of Big Lots but cheaper because almost everything is $0.99. I am a huge fan and I wish they would expand and have more locations. I know that some location even carry organic groceries!!! Can't beat that!!!

They have a good selection of veggies and fruits here. Sometimes, their veggies and fruits rotate so if I was specifically looking for something I wouldn't count on them to have it 100% of the time. They have started selling milk here (not for $0.99 though), so if I need I can get some here. There is always a steady stream of customers coming in and out; the checkout is quick and the cashiers are friendly. Parking is usually not a problem.

This is a basic 99 cent store. Relatively small and somewhat cluttered and unkept feeling. I don't want to totally hammer the place because there are some nice little snags here and there, just don't expect diamond in the rough lifetime merchandise here. I find it quite nice to run over to the store and pick up some big size candy boxes of candy. They have lots of candy that is cheap and its great! I shall continue to patron this store.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                99 Cents Only Stores dates back to the 1960's when the company's founder, Dave Gold, inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown Los Angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed price-point of 99 cents. The test was instant success, and Dave thought that selling everything in the store for 99 cents would be hugely popular.On "lucky" Friday, the 13th of August in 1982, Dave and Sherry Gold opened the first 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles. To celebrate the Grand Opening, Dave decided to sell television sets for only 99 cents to the store's first 9 customers. More than 300 people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open. The huge line caught the media's attention, and more than 10 TV outlets covered the store's first day. The success of this first grand opening inspired a tradition that continues today, with every new store offering incredible 99-cent deals for televisions and other exciting products.

Whenever I go here, I'm impressed at the items they have in stock. I always feel like I'm getting a great deal. The issues I have is they almost always have a long line and the parking can get crazy at times.







This is a pretty nice 99 Cents Only Store. They have a large produce section in the back, and the veggies and fruits look fresh and still high quality. There's a good selection of products, from home wares to food to clothing. The cashiers are friendly and efficient. There's a good-sized parking lot, but it tends to be quite full. 

Pro-tip: bring your own bag or you'll get charged.







The lady yesterday pulling the ice pallet was racist! Heavy set women light skinned telling rudely and couldn't possibly say excuse me to anyone her words were "What you don't understand english?"  She did not say this to me but to multiple customers! RUDE! I wish I could remember the woman's name! I did inform a cashier but really allowing an employee to first of all not say excuse me at all is horrible, then to repeat her ugly words WOW! I'd rather spend the extra cash at another store than have to hear those things especially my child to be exposed to that behavior.   SHAME on you and your employee!!







Yeah, you can find some deals at this store, however, not always, some things, you are paying over price since they may be a little bit cheaper somewhere else. Also, sooner or later, they are going to have to change the name of the store to 99 cent plus or 99 cents and over because now, not everything is 99 cents. Which usually  the better brand shampoos such as L'Oreal  brass conditioner which  was 1.99 and some other stuff such as toys,select produce and household products are 1.99, 3.99 and seen things that cost up to 7.99. So the thank you for shopping at 99 cents only store slogan has to go. Also, the parking can be a pain since it's a small lot and the store isn't as big like the Gilroy location. But yet, it's a good store if you like to save money.







Either you get what you paid for or you just found some awesome deals!! This store is 10x more awesome than the dollar tree or any other dollar store I've been too. They even have groceries?!!?

Of course there are some things you could find cheaper than here somewhere else if you know the coupon life. 

This is officially my favorite 99 cent store!







There were a some things that I thought was inconvenient and if you're planning to go here, you should be aware.

1. The road. There's a median along the main road the is only accessible by one way. Although, if you are going eastbound from Stevens Creek, there's a left turn you could use but if you're planning to go eastbound coming out of the store, you have to make a U-turn.

2. Small parking lot. You have to circle around a couple times or wait for someone to pull out to park. Another option is to street park somewhere nearby and walk there.

3. Long lines. When I went here, there were only two open registers when there were over 8 people waiting and these people buy in bulk so you could see everyone's frustration.

What I like about this is that you get what you pay for. You can honestly save money here especially if you're looking for cleaning supplies, snacks, and groceries.







I live in South San Jose and sometimes stop here when I am in the area. Doesn't make cents to travel 10 miles to buy one thing. For those who are looking for bargains, this is the place. 

My first time in a 99 Cents Only store was in Victorville, a much larger location than this one. When I first saw the selection I thought it was too good to be true, and discovered it isn't. Much like Harbor Freight Tools, there are amazing deals to be had here; stay away from things that are questionable however like in any discount store. This store is the only 99 cents only store in San Jose. 

The best bargains I found here are 2 liters of Pepsi products for 99c, gasket sealant, hardware, bungee cords and certain housewares. I have found better value and selection here compared to Dollar Tree. Plus theres no limit on the 99c 2-liter Pepsi. 

Do go during non-peak times, the timeframe I have visited this store is Friday night an hour before closing, and the parking and lines are reasonable. Do shop 99 Cents Only first, provided your aren't going out of your way for a can of soup. Do buy Pepsi products here if you're a Pepsi drinker.







Dear Michelle: Thank you for reaching out to me. I don't think there if you can really improve since the female workers are always in cohorts with one another. The male employees are very nice and take their job seriously . I hope things will work out for your store ! Thanks







Unprofessional Folks !!!

2 weeks back we asked a store representative if they fill helium air for balloons bought from other store, and the person replied yes stating different pricing models.  We called today to confirm the same, and we were told same information.  However, when we took our balloons the person there replied that they don't do external balloons, and this has been 5 year policy.  Moreover, the response was in rude and unprofessional manner.  So we have 2 issues with this store: 
1. Rude staff
2. Inconsistent information amongst different employees of same store

We will never buy anything from this store again :(







Overall experience not bad at all. The staff are friendly. I admire one of the staff who worked at a cashier. I wish I remember her name. She was a very positive person. She works 2 or 3 jobs and just everything with a smile. Wish more people are like this especially hard time here living here in the bay area. One thing I wish you guys had more items- like more newer products for the toys or cosmetic section.







Great store. You can find so many different things here. all for $0.99 or under! I stocked up on cleaning supplies, office supplies, and even found some great food things to take home and make a salad with. Seriously, they have soooo much stuff this place is great. 

I would give them a 5 star but some of the produce was...questionable. I am not sure if they have the proper cooling system and it seemed like some of the veggies that were supposed to be crisp were limp and soft. 

This is definitely a place where you have to keep your eyes peeled. There is so much to look at, it is worth it going down each isle, you never know what great deal you will find! I will be back!







I enjoy coming to this store. I love there products like there lime bags, candy selection, produce and so on. They have the actual name brand chips and drinks and not select like other stores. Which ever holiday thats near they always have items. Covers and chargers for your iPhones. You name it they have it. 

Parking maybe be a hassle sometimes. Not everything is .99 anymore. Make sure you ask the cashier at the register if your not sure.







A hidden gem!!!!!!

So I always come to use the bathroom while shopping down the street at Crossroads Trading Co. and had a craving for some gum. While the bathroom is quite nasty, it works. 

I ventured into the store in search of some chicle (gum) and holy smokes!

Not only did this place have one of the most extensive candy aisles I have ever seen, but also party planning supplies, air fresheners, toilet items, and even a substantial array of groceries including fruits, veggies, and get this...Chobani yogurt!

Also, the people at the counter are actually surprisingly friendly. The woman was quite entertained by my yammering about my fascination with the one cent tax on gum (apparently it is considered a food....ummmm yah I will have to talk to the gov. about that one). 

While I don't think I would shop here on a regular basis, it is dirt cheap and perfect for planning a party. Plus, it's just fun to scour the aisles to see what you can get!

In summary, come here for party planning, if you need a few cheap random groceries, or for funsies!







It's a discount store. don't expect service like you're shopping at Nordstrom or some other place. For the price and selection this place is really nice. Know your prices for goods though, not everything you can buy here is worth it. Also be sure to check the EXP DATES on any food items you are buying! The store itself is always packed with goodies and is nice and clean.







Seriously amazing. I mainly come here for the incredibly cheap produce, but I always leave with all kinds of stuff including home goods and small toys. I can't believe the deals. Every time I leave, I feel like I robbed the place. ;p People complain about the parking and long lines. It's a very small price to pay... just like the price for all the goods you take home.







Not the greatest dollar store but just okay. They oddly sell food and candy here and they definitely look old or unappetizing. The products they have are okay but you can't find much. They have party, beauty, car accessories, and all that here but I leave empty handed.







This place is great. Groceries, toiletries, school supplies, kitchen tools, car tools, cleaning supplies, party supplies, etc etc. They have it all! And all for 99 cents?? What?!

I like to prep for when SHTF (shit hits the fan)... So I like to stock up on TP, paper towels, bar soap, dish soap, canned foods, trash bags, pain pills, etc. BUT, I like to do so in a cheap manner LOL... because when shit DOESN'T hit the fan, I didn't shell out too much $... and when it does, I plan to survive it with my stock pile and AR15 (harhar)







What can you say about stuff for a dollar? Good deal even though they do stuff now like milk, produce and oil etc... That's more than $1!
Lots of stuff to choose from but they don't restock, organize or clean Well. 
The thing that I knotice most is people hate that there are always lines! they never have enough people working, it's No wonder things get stolen from there all the time(you see the open packages all over every day).







I love when I come out to California and can come here for my cheap apartment stuff so when I leave I can just pitch it. The area the store is located in is not the best, the parking lot is terrible, not greatly lit and totally gross...there is a lady that is out there selling tamales....and people just 'strolling' the parking lot. Inside the store...it's a discount store...not saks...I like that they have a food section...look at expiration dates though. The red headed guy that works in there looks like he is super not happy to be at work. Go to another lane if you can ;-)







No. No.  No.  A thousand times no.  The lines are way too long here, and it takes forever to check out - not on what would presumably be peak hours like the weekend.  I went at 2:00 PM on a Wednesday, and the wait time was ridiculous.  The small, cramped parking lot cannot accommodate all the customers.  I witnessed two people getting into it over a parking space.  The selection is comparable to Dollar Tree, but I'd say Dollar Tree is slightly better.  Do yourself a favor and go there.

I have found better value and selection here compared to Dollar Tree. Plus theres no limit on the 99c 2-liter Pepsi. Do go during non-peak times, the timeframe I have visited this store is Friday night an hour before closing, and the parking and lines are reasonable. Do shop 99 Cents Only first, provided your aren't going out of your way for a can of soup. Do buy Pepsi products here if you're a Pepsi drinker.

Dear Michelle: Thank you for reaching out to me. I don't think there if you can really improve since the female workers are always in cohorts with one another. The male employees are very nice and take their job seriously . I hope things will work out for your store ! Thanks

Unprofessional Folks !!!2 weeks back we asked a store representative if they fill helium air for balloons bought from other store, and the person replied yes stating different pricing models.  We called today to confirm the same, and we were told same information.  However, when we took our balloons the person there replied that they don't do external balloons, and this has been 5 year policy.  Moreover, the response was in rude and unprofessional manner.  So we have 2 issues with this store: 1. Rude staff2. Inconsistent information amongst different employees of same storeWe will never buy anything from this store again :(

Overall experience not bad at all. The staff are friendly. I admire one of the staff who worked at a cashier. I wish I remember her name. She was a very positive person. She works 2 or 3 jobs and just everything with a smile. Wish more people are like this especially hard time here living here in the bay area. One thing I wish you guys had more items- like more newer products for the toys or cosmetic section.

Great store. You can find so many different things here. all for $0.99 or under! I stocked up on cleaning supplies, office supplies, and even found some great food things to take home and make a salad with. Seriously, they have soooo much stuff this place is great. I would give them a 5 star but some of the produce was...questionable. I am not sure if they have the proper cooling system and it seemed like some of the veggies that were supposed to be crisp were limp and soft. This is definitely a place where you have to keep your eyes peeled. There is so much to look at, it is worth it going down each isle, you never know what great deal you will find! I will be back!

I enjoy coming to this store. I love there products like there lime bags, candy selection, produce and so on. They have the actual name brand chips and drinks and not select like other stores. Which ever holiday thats near they always have items. Covers and chargers for your iPhones. You name it they have it. Parking maybe be a hassle sometimes. Not everything is .99 anymore. Make sure you ask the cashier at the register if your not sure.

A hidden gem!!!!!!So I always come to use the bathroom while shopping down the street at Crossroads Trading Co. and had a craving for some gum. While the bathroom is quite nasty, it works. I ventured into the store in search of some chicle (gum) and holy smokes!Not only did this place have one of the most extensive candy aisles I have ever seen, but also party planning supplies, air fresheners, toilet items, and even a substantial array of groceries including fruits, veggies, and get this...Chobani yogurt!Also, the people at the counter are actually surprisingly friendly. The woman was quite entertained by my yammering about my fascination with the one cent tax on gum (apparently it is considered a food....ummmm yah I will have to talk to the gov. about that one). While I don't think I would shop here on a regular basis, it is dirt cheap and perfect for planning a party. Plus, it's just fun to scour the aisles to see what you can get!In summary, come here for party planning, if you need a few cheap random groceries, or for funsies!

It's a discount store. don't expect service like you're shopping at Nordstrom or some other place. For the price and selection this place is really nice. Know your prices for goods though, not everything you can buy here is worth it. Also be sure to check the EXP DATES on any food items you are buying! The store itself is always packed with goodies and is nice and clean.

Seriously amazing. I mainly come here for the incredibly cheap produce, but I always leave with all kinds of stuff including home goods and small toys. I can't believe the deals. Every time I leave, I feel like I robbed the place. ;p People complain about the parking and long lines. It's a very small price to pay... just like the price for all the goods you take home.

Not the greatest dollar store but just okay. They oddly sell food and candy here and they definitely look old or unappetizing. The products they have are okay but you can't find much. They have party, beauty, car accessories, and all that here but I leave empty handed.

This place is great. Groceries, toiletries, school supplies, kitchen tools, car tools, cleaning supplies, party supplies, etc etc. They have it all! And all for 99 cents?? What?!I like to prep for when SHTF (shit hits the fan)... So I like to stock up on TP, paper towels, bar soap, dish soap, canned foods, trash bags, pain pills, etc. BUT, I like to do so in a cheap manner LOL... because when shit DOESN'T hit the fan, I didn't shell out too much $... and when it does, I plan to survive it with my stock pile and AR15 (harhar)

What can you say about stuff for a dollar? Good deal even though they do stuff now like milk, produce and oil etc... That's more than $1!Lots of stuff to choose from but they don't restock, organize or clean Well. The thing that I knotice most is people hate that there are always lines! they never have enough people working, it's No wonder things get stolen from there all the time(you see the open packages all over every day).

I love when I come out to California and can come here for my cheap apartment stuff so when I leave I can just pitch it. The area the store is located in is not the best, the parking lot is terrible, not greatly lit and totally gross...there is a lady that is out there selling tamales....and people just 'strolling' the parking lot. Inside the store...it's a discount store...not saks...I like that they have a food section...look at expiration dates though. The red headed guy that works in there looks like he is super not happy to be at work. Go to another lane if you can ;-)

No. No.  No.  A thousand times no.  The lines are way too long here, and it takes forever to check out - not on what would presumably be peak hours like the weekend.  I went at 2:00 PM on a Wednesday, and the wait time was ridiculous.  The small, cramped parking lot cannot accommodate all the customers.  I witnessed two people getting into it over a parking space.  The selection is comparable to Dollar Tree, but I'd say Dollar Tree is slightly better.  Do yourself a favor and go there.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                99 Cents Only Stores dates back to the 1960's when the company's founder, Dave Gold, inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown Los Angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed price-point of 99 cents. The test was instant success, and Dave thought that selling everything in the store for 99 cents would be hugely popular.On "lucky" Friday, the 13th of August in 1982, Dave and Sherry Gold opened the first 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles. To celebrate the Grand Opening, Dave decided to sell television sets for only 99 cents to the store's first 9 customers. More than 300 people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open. The huge line caught the media's attention, and more than 10 TV outlets covered the store's first day. The success of this first grand opening inspired a tradition that continues today, with every new store offering incredible 99-cent deals for televisions and other exciting products.

                I like coming here for pet toys, poop bags, spices, ketchup, toys for kids, holiday decorations, party supplies, nail polish, and random knick knacks.

                The kitchen area and office/school supplies are probably my favorite sections.

The name of the store isn't truthful. There are some items in here that are over 99 cents, but they're always clearly marked, so there should be no confusion. I wish I lived closer because this is one of the better 99 cents stores out there. There's cooler things here than at the Dollar Tree and maybe even Daiso.

I haven't been here in a long time and was surprised that I walked out with so many things. They had on-trend items like bandanas, puffy keychains, infinity scarves, and all that. What was really weird is they had boxes of Maybelline makeup for only 99 cents?? They're not old products either. It's the same ones that are sold for $6-10 at drugstores. A lot of the items were broken, but I dug in and found a highlighter in brand new condition.

The real highlight here is the produce section. They have plantains, tomatoes, avocados, and more for super cheap prices. They also carry organic soy and almond milk. It's worth coming back here if you're trying to eat healthy on a budget. They also have a good selection of candy and chips. I love that they had a the tiny extra hot cheetos bags for 4/$1. It's a good bargain.

Cashiers could be friendly. Crowd can be a bit sketch sometimes.







I just don't learn....never come here on the weekends, nor anytime after 11 am!!!  Crowded, long lines, sketch people...customers with 'trashy' tudes which sometimes feels you're standing in the DMV line.

Store itself has some good items and sweet/salty snacks Oprah would love, Dr. Oz would say stay away from and Dr. Phil would ask 'its not what you're eating, but what's eating you?' type of place....chocolate donnettes, honey buns, punch in every (artificial) color, chips, chicharonnes, beef jerky, pudding, frozen snacks, etc...a stoners 'late night munchies' paradise! 

This place does have discount saran wrap, aluminum foil, storage containers, Sharpies, tape, some garden items, canned goods galore, some produce, eggs, milk, a large frozen food section, off-brand baking products and again, more sweet/salty snacks...sometimes you can get a good find and then you pat yourself on the back but as you stand in the checkout line, you notice all the random yummy snacks you really didn't need!

If you choose not to heed my warning abt venturing on the weekend, be sure to bring some patience...my experiece today was a lady getting rung up while sending her 4 kids to go to aisle blah blah to get more stuff....as the line is 7 people deep, the rest of us are standing waiting (patiently) while the checker has her finger over the total button! Grrrrrrrrr......and sadly, this is common so come on weekday morning







This is a nice and clean 99 Cent Only Stores location inside the Creekside Shopping Center here in Hayward, California. Surprisingly for Hayward, it was pretty clean and well organized.

I always takes pictures of places I go and add them to Yelp, they don't allow pictures here at this location, apparently. I was taking one near the front, and the cashier yelled at me for taking pictures. I took some anyways, away from the employees...

The shelves here are well stocked and organized compared to many other locations I've been too. They also had a lot more of a variety of stuff, compared to other stores as well, it was easier to shop here because it was really organized.

Another plus is that Big Lot's is right next door, so you can shop for even more bargains there as well. Parking is easily accessible as well, plenty of parking.







It's a wrap... No, seriously... It's a WRAP! Gift wrap, baby shower bags and cheap snacks!? IT'S A WRAP! When inflation is ruining it for everything else in this country, we still gOt the dOlla stO'! Let's wrap it up, ugh! Wrap it up! Ugh! (with a balloon on tha siiide).







This place is amazing! I came here today in the morning and everything was stocked and clean. I was amazed at their produce aisle and all the fruits and vegetables they had to offer! They also had a lot of main brand items for cheaper prices and lots of toys for kids that you could buy as a gift. I didn't know they carried that stuff. Found some fun activity books for my kids and got some stuff for Easter. I will definatly be coming back here again! :)







Terrible disgraceful employees.  They use foul language, heckle the customers and say derogatory comments.  The cashier named Lykai said "f*#k America" and threw up his middle finger to a customer. I caught it on video.  
The manager just stood by listening and watching and did nothing. They all must feel the same way there.  Disgrace!
Look in the photos and videos for a snip of what I witnessed.







I always tell myself that i only need to get one thing but i ended up getting so many stuff. This place is clean and i love it here so much.







It's a challenge for me to pass up dollar stores. I'm constantly looking for bargains and this branch of the popular 99 Cent Only chain usually has what I'm seeking.  This time I was on the hunt for some small-size pasta for an Italian soup. We found a 30-cent bag as well my daughter's favorite hot sauce, Valentina, with the orange top. I kept my daughter very close to me as this store was the site of a terrible attack on a small child a few years ago. There were a couple of oddballs but we ignored them and were soon on our way.  Despite the long line, our cashier was quick, unlike the folks at the Greenhouse branch.







Merchandises are good. However they should provide security there. Many suspicious people going around...my wallet has been stolen last week. I should get away from this place after I noticed that. The staff there doesn't care a dame shit on what happened!!! They seem to get used to it...Hayward police doesn't have jurisdiction over the location. It was troublesome to find a justice department even just to report the incident. If you really need to shop there, be double cautious!







staff is always great! great selection of items as well.  dollar tree is a dump compared to 99 cents only stores







As a kid I lived for 99 Cent Only stores and as an adult...I live for 99 Cent Only stores!

So maybe LIVE is a stretch...

Anyway, I'm planning a baby shower for my homegirl, so I stopped in to see if they had any glass vases that I liked.

The 99 Cent Only Stores sell a variety of items and all are, wait for it,  99 cents. So don't come up in here asking an employee, "How much is this?" 

You can find name brand closeout items amongst the food, they offer a variety of produce, and you can basically outfit your entire home or apartment if you browse through the home/kitchen goods carefully.

Because it's 99 Cents you're not gonna get too many high falootin' folks in here. So, yep. Kids are screaming, parents are cursing (at the kids, at each other), folks on that stuff got the munchies, you'll randomly see some fresh convicts perusing down the aisles...just normal every day stuff.

My tips:
1. Read the dates on EVERY THING.
2. Don't buy batteries here. They will die quickly. Buy batteries in bulk at Costco.
3. Check out the ceramic dishes.
4. Be prepared to wait in long lines. 
5. Watch your personal goods. Ladies, don't leave your purses hanging around your cart.

Happy hunting!







SSssshhhhHHHhhhh!!!  

(I think they forgot to add in a couple dollars to their price tags)

(Because I only spent $20 and came out with bags of stuff)

(It's like I nickeled and dimed this place without having to nickel and dime them)

(Bargain hunters need not hunt at this place because they forgot to add a couple dollars to their price tags)

SSssshhhhHHHhhhh!!!







fremont and the location on lewelling is better.   

last few times i came here. it was just a bunch of crazy shit.







This is definitely one of my favorite discount stores! They have everything from groceries to clothes!!! The variety of items are unbelievable and they actually have named brand things. I go here all the time to by whipping cream, toiletries, waters, Gatorade and snacks if I'm in the mood to pig out. I have also found myself buying tub ware plates and cupcake pans(all for a dollar or less). Definitely recommend this as a place to budge shop for whatever you may need.







"99 Cent Only Store" isnt all true when it comes to the cost of everything they sell. Nice big location and always seems to be somewhat organized, Never a total mess. I always impressed coming here. They always have something different or something I can use. Huge selection of different products. One of the best locations ive been to.







Love this 99cents only store i always find good stuff here . Like foster grant sunglasses. Sally hansen nail polishes and nutra nail polishes. Best to come early morning to avoid long lines. Your expectations can't be too high it is a 99 cent store after all ;)







thIS 99 cents store isn't as big nor busy as the 'dro store. 

bargain hunting and checking items which didn't sell well elsewhere::
-tazo tea (2/.99)
some fruit juices, sugar cane, herbs, interesting taste. why it failed?
-welch's white grape peach(.59)
tasted kind of sweet, tangy and strange  with all the differeht juices
-kern's tomato & clam cocktail (.49)
nice kick of a taste until you taste the msg. notice the frutose on the label. fail!

notes:
-food products on the cheap so you can find why they fail. definitely worth not paying full price.
-scanners make the lines move faster.







My mom buys the coolest toys here for my baby boy. His favorite toys are from this store!







Call me Miss Classy but I ain't ashamed to say I shop at this store. Yes, I Love this place, probably the best 99 cent store I've been to and definitely the largest. You can also find fresh produce here. This is definitely the go-to spot for any funny b-day and Christmas presents or party decorations. Amongst the most popular are the acclaimed bump-it, a du-rag accompanied by a huge pencil with personal sharpener, matching princess sippy cups and water jug (not used for water), many disney socks and bob marley hair extensions. Often times I will plan parties based on what ever theme I can find down the isles of this place.







Great prices to stock up on candy and snacks you haven't seen in forever, and other items not worth paying over a dollar. Not five stars because of the usually long lines.

The name of the store isn't truthful. There are some items in here that are over 99 cents, but they're always clearly marked, so there should be no confusion. I wish I lived closer because this is one of the better 99 cents stores out there. There's cooler things here than at the Dollar Tree and maybe even Daiso.I haven't been here in a long time and was surprised that I walked out with so many things. They had on-trend items like bandanas, puffy keychains, infinity scarves, and all that. What was really weird is they had boxes of Maybelline makeup for only 99 cents?? They're not old products either. It's the same ones that are sold for $6-10 at drugstores. A lot of the items were broken, but I dug in and found a highlighter in brand new condition.The real highlight here is the produce section. They have plantains, tomatoes, avocados, and more for super cheap prices. They also carry organic soy and almond milk. It's worth coming back here if you're trying to eat healthy on a budget. They also have a good selection of candy and chips. I love that they had a the tiny extra hot cheetos bags for 4/$1. It's a good bargain.Cashiers could be friendly. Crowd can be a bit sketch sometimes.

Hi Karen, we're sorry you were let down.  We value your feedback. Some of our customers enjoy the items over 99 cents since they are still a great value. We are now working on labeling these items better for you and other customers to differentiate while you shop with us. We still have lots of great things for 99 cents.

I just don't learn....never come here on the weekends, nor anytime after 11 am!!!  Crowded, long lines, sketch people...customers with 'trashy' tudes which sometimes feels you're standing in the DMV line.Store itself has some good items and sweet/salty snacks Oprah would love, Dr. Oz would say stay away from and Dr. Phil would ask 'its not what you're eating, but what's eating you?' type of place....chocolate donnettes, honey buns, punch in every (artificial) color, chips, chicharonnes, beef jerky, pudding, frozen snacks, etc...a stoners 'late night munchies' paradise! This place does have discount saran wrap, aluminum foil, storage containers, Sharpies, tape, some garden items, canned goods galore, some produce, eggs, milk, a large frozen food section, off-brand baking products and again, more sweet/salty snacks...sometimes you can get a good find and then you pat yourself on the back but as you stand in the checkout line, you notice all the random yummy snacks you really didn't need!If you choose not to heed my warning abt venturing on the weekend, be sure to bring some patience...my experiece today was a lady getting rung up while sending her 4 kids to go to aisle blah blah to get more stuff....as the line is 7 people deep, the rest of us are standing waiting (patiently) while the checker has her finger over the total button! Grrrrrrrrr......and sadly, this is common so come on weekday morning

This is a nice and clean 99 Cent Only Stores location inside the Creekside Shopping Center here in Hayward, California. Surprisingly for Hayward, it was pretty clean and well organized.I always takes pictures of places I go and add them to Yelp, they don't allow pictures here at this location, apparently. I was taking one near the front, and the cashier yelled at me for taking pictures. I took some anyways, away from the employees...The shelves here are well stocked and organized compared to many other locations I've been too. They also had a lot more of a variety of stuff, compared to other stores as well, it was easier to shop here because it was really organized.Another plus is that Big Lot's is right next door, so you can shop for even more bargains there as well. Parking is easily accessible as well, plenty of parking.

It's a challenge for me to pass up dollar stores. I'm constantly looking for bargains and this branch of the popular 99 Cent Only chain usually has what I'm seeking.  This time I was on the hunt for some small-size pasta for an Italian soup. We found a 30-cent bag as well my daughter's favorite hot sauce, Valentina, with the orange top. I kept my daughter very close to me as this store was the site of a terrible attack on a small child a few years ago. There were a couple of oddballs but we ignored them and were soon on our way.  Despite the long line, our cashier was quick, unlike the folks at the Greenhouse branch.

As a kid I lived for 99 Cent Only stores and as an adult...I live for 99 Cent Only stores!So maybe LIVE is a stretch...Anyway, I'm planning a baby shower for my homegirl, so I stopped in to see if they had any glass vases that I liked.The 99 Cent Only Stores sell a variety of items and all are, wait for it,  99 cents. So don't come up in here asking an employee, "How much is this?" You can find name brand closeout items amongst the food, they offer a variety of produce, and you can basically outfit your entire home or apartment if you browse through the home/kitchen goods carefully.Because it's 99 Cents you're not gonna get too many high falootin' folks in here. So, yep. Kids are screaming, parents are cursing (at the kids, at each other), folks on that stuff got the munchies, you'll randomly see some fresh convicts perusing down the aisles...just normal every day stuff.My tips:1. Read the dates on EVERY THING.2. Don't buy batteries here. They will die quickly. Buy batteries in bulk at Costco.3. Check out the ceramic dishes.4. Be prepared to wait in long lines. 5. Watch your personal goods. Ladies, don't leave your purses hanging around your cart.Happy hunting!

hey its a $1 store allot bigger than dollar tree. and they have much more in stock.  its like every time i come here just to grab like a few things i end up walking out with about $30 worth of stuff. i also like it cause i can hit up big lots as well. the only thing i don't like are the bums.  the non profit ones and the street bums. but other than that. where else can you stock up on all your basics for $40.   they have all my spices. condiments. vitamins. can food.   and stuff i need for baking. they also have fruit. veggies. and good selection of bread.   few places that have texas toast bread for french toast or a killer grilled chesse. i also like coming here to stock up before hitting the theater.  cause you know how much the food is in the movies.

This is definitely one of my favorite discount stores! They have everything from groceries to clothes!!! The variety of items are unbelievable and they actually have named brand things. I go here all the time to by whipping cream, toiletries, waters, Gatorade and snacks if I'm in the mood to pig out. I have also found myself buying tub ware plates and cupcake pans(all for a dollar or less). Definitely recommend this as a place to budge shop for whatever you may need.

"99 Cent Only Store" isnt all true when it comes to the cost of everything they sell. Nice big location and always seems to be somewhat organized, Never a total mess. I always impressed coming here. They always have something different or something I can use. Huge selection of different products. One of the best locations ive been to.

Love this 99cents only store i always find good stuff here . Like foster grant sunglasses. Sally hansen nail polishes and nutra nail polishes. Best to come early morning to avoid long lines. Your expectations can't be too high it is a 99 cent store after all ;)

thIS 99 cents store isn't as big nor busy as the 'dro store. bargain hunting and checking items which didn't sell well elsewhere::-tazo tea (2/.99)some fruit juices, sugar cane, herbs, interesting taste. why it failed?-welch's white grape peach(.59)tasted kind of sweet, tangy and strange  with all the differeht juices-kern's tomato & clam cocktail (.49)nice kick of a taste until you taste the msg. notice the frutose on the label. fail!notes:-food products on the cheap so you can find why they fail. definitely worth not paying full price.-scanners make the lines move faster.

Call me Miss Classy but I ain't ashamed to say I shop at this store. Yes, I Love this place, probably the best 99 cent store I've been to and definitely the largest. You can also find fresh produce here. This is definitely the go-to spot for any funny b-day and Christmas presents or party decorations. Amongst the most popular are the acclaimed bump-it, a du-rag accompanied by a huge pencil with personal sharpener, matching princess sippy cups and water jug (not used for water), many disney socks and bob marley hair extensions. Often times I will plan parties based on what ever theme I can find down the isles of this place.

Great prices to stock up on candy and snacks you haven't seen in forever, and other items not worth paying over a dollar. Not five stars because of the usually long lines.Great prices to stock up on candy and snacks you haven't seen in forever, and other items not worth paying over a dollar.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                99 Cents Only Stores dates back to the 1960's when the company's founder, Dave Gold, inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown Los Angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed price-point of 99 cents. The test was instant success, and Dave thought that selling everything in the store for 99 cents would be hugely popular.On "lucky" Friday, the 13th of August in 1982, Dave and Sherry Gold opened the first 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles. To celebrate the Grand Opening, Dave decided to sell television sets for only 99 cents to the store's first 9 customers. More than 300 people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open. The huge line caught the media's attention, and more than 10 TV outlets covered the store's first day. The success of this first grand opening inspired a tradition that continues today, with every new store offering incredible 99-cent deals for televisions and other exciting products.

CITY OF COMMERCE, Calif., Sept. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- 
Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Overview:

Net sales increased 1.6% to $496.4 million compared to the prior year 
Same-store sales increased by 1.1% 
Net loss was $35.1 million compared to net loss of $78.1 million in prior year 
Adjusted EBITDA1 was $5.2 million compared to $6.9 million in prior year








99 Cents Only Stores LLC (the "Company") announced its financial results for second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended July 29, 2016. 
Geoffrey Covert, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "I remain encouraged by our progress in executing our turnaround plan. With measurable improvement this past quarter, we have solid momentum as we enter the second half of fiscal 2017. Progress is evident across many aspects of the enterprise and our improved sales performance provides an indication that our plan is taking hold.  During the second quarter, same-store sales were positive 1.1%, and on a year to date basis, same store sales improved to positive 0.5%. In addition, total inventory as of the end of the second quarter was $176 million, down nearly $100 million from $275 million as of the end of the second quarter last year.  Finally, our improved sales performance and lower inventory levels have collectively strengthened our liquidity position.  Cash borrowings under our ABL facility are now the lowest they have been in the past two years. As of the end of the second quarter cash borrowings under our ABL facility were $21 million, down $19 million compared to the prior quarter end and down $86 million from a year ago."
Mr. Covert concluded, "Since beginning our turn-around plan in the third quarter last year, we have maintained that it will take time to operationally address our key issues—and even longer for the changes we are making to be fully reflected in our financial results.  However, based on the results of the first half of fiscal 2017, I am optimistic that we remain on-track to return 99 Cents Only Stores to sustained growth in the long-run."  
Second Quarter Financial Results
For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company's net sales increased 1.6%, to $496.4 million, compared to $488.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Same-store sales increased 1.1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, with higher customer traffic of 1.5% offset by lower average ticket of 0.4%. Positives in same-store sales included higher sales in produce, consumables and grocery, as a result of improved product availability and higher in-stock levels due to improvements in the allocation and replenishment system, and the expansion of the Company's partnership with a third party produce distributor. Challenges in same-store sales included lower seasonal sales due to the overlapping of significant inventory purchases in fiscal 2016, which increased sales but led to excess inventory levels in stores, and prompted ongoing initiatives to clear excess on-hand seasonal inventory through promotions and mark-downs. In addition, persistent price deflation in dairy negatively impacted sales of milk and eggs.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase of 60 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Gross margin was higher due to lower inventory shrinkage that was primarily driven by a favorable comparison against the second quarter of last year, when the shrink provision rate was increased to better reflect the unfavorable physical inventory counts completed during the quarter. This was partially offset by higher distribution and transportation expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Product margin was flat compared to second quarter of fiscal 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $159.5 million, or 32.1% as a percentage of net sales, representing an increase of 50 basis points from the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by an increase in the California minimum wage. 
Net loss was $35.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to net loss of $78.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Net loss as a percentage of net sales was (7.1)% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to net loss of (16.0)% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $6.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.1% compared to 1.4% over the same period.
Year-to-Date Financial Results
For the first half of fiscal 2017, the Company's net sales increased 1.5% to $1,009.4 million, compared to $994.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. Same-store sales increased 0.5% driven by higher average ticket. Net loss was $60.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to net loss of $76.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2016. Net loss as a percentage of total sales was (6.0)% for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to net loss as a percentage of total sales of (7.7)% for the first half of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $18.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to $31.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.8% for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to 3.2% for the first half of fiscal 2016.
Store Openings
During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company opened three new stores and closed one store upon the expiration of a lease. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company operated 394 stores, an increase of 1.2% in store count over the same period of last year. 
Sale of Warehouse Facility
During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company sold and concurrently licensed through January 31, 2017 a warehouse facility in the City of Commerce, California with a carrying value of $12.1 million and received net proceeds from this transaction of $28.5 million. Due in part to the significant inventory reductions the Company has achieved in recent quarters, the Company is rationalizing its warehouse footprint and this facility was not considered a strategic asset. The Company expects to completely exit the facility by the end of fiscal 2017.
Fiscal 2017 Outlook
The Company is reiterating the following previously issued outlook for fiscal 2017:

Positive same-store sales growth 
Substantial year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2017, and a substantial decrease in net loss over the same period 
Capital expenditures of approximately $35-$40 million. The Company is currently evaluating the expansion of its store refresh initiative which may require the Company to update its full year capital expenditure outlook.
The Company is revising the following previously issued outlook for fiscal 2017 to reflect changes in timing of select new store openings previously scheduled for the second half of fiscal 2017: 

5 new store openings

Overview
Why incorporate.com?
FAQs



Simply put, it's the least complex business structure. Unlike an s corp or c corp, an LLC's structure is flexible. It also gives you the perk of pass-through taxes, limited liability (obviously), and legal protection for your personal assets. Plus the added benefit of looking more legit than the other guys.
Advantages of an LLC
There are several advantages to starting an LLC, but here are a few that stand out.

Pass-through taxes. There's no need to file a corporate tax return. Owners report their share of profit and loss on their individual tax returns, meaning you avoid double taxation.
No residency requirement. Owners need not be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
Legal protection. Owners have limited liability for business debts and obligations.
Enhanced credibility. Partners, suppliers, and lenders may look more favorably on your business when you've formed an LLC.

Compare LLCs and corporations with our business comparison chart.
Disadvantages of an LLC
Creating an LLC is an attractive option, but there are a few hurdles.

Limited growth potential. You cannot issue shares of stock to attract investors.
Lack of uniformity. LLCs can be treated differently in different states.
Self-employment tax. Earnings can be subject to this kind of taxation.
Tax recognition on appreciated assets. This could happen if you convert an existing business to an LLC. One more way that extra taxation can occur.

Is Creating an LLC Right for Me?
That really depends on what your short-term and long-term business goals are. We recommend that you put some thought into where your business is now and how you want your business to grow before deciding whether the LLC structure is right for you.
How to Form an LLC (Limited Liability Company):

Choose a legal name and reserve it, if the Secretary of State in your state does that sort of thing (not all do).
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation with your Secretary of State.
Decide who will run the business (managers or members)
Decide how many owners are in the business
Apply for a business license and other certificates specific to your industry.
File Form SS-4 or apply online at the Internal Revenue Service website to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN).
Apply for any other ID numbers required by state and local government agencies. Requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another, but generally your business most likely will be required to pay unemployment, disability, and other payroll taxes – you will need tax ID numbers for those accounts in addition to your EIN.

Popular states to form an LLC in include Delaware, California, Florida, New York, Nevada, and Texas.
Benefit#1: Cost Savings
Forming an LLC with a lawyer has been the traditional route. However, with new technology and an abundance of state information available online, if you create your LLC online with incorporate.com, you can generally save significant money over hiring a lawyer. Using information that you provide to us, we complete the state-required forms, send them to you for review, and then submit them to the Secretary of State, all for less than what an attorney would usually charge.
Benefit #2: Time Savings
Traditionally, the process of completing the forms and filing with the state can take days or weeks. Today, by forming an online LLC with incorporate.com, you can achieve huge time savings. The filing of needed documents is normally done within 24-48 hours of your order. Of course, we can't control the state's turnaround time, but we promise that you won't be waiting on us. When the Secretary of State issues the evidence of filing, we'll provide it to you right away – no waiting for an appointment or paying for our time. If you need a hard copy, we'll send it to you via FedEx.
Benefit #3: Online Compliance Watch®
All of our formation packages include free access to Compliance Watch, a state-of-the-art online compliance management tool that will help you keep your business in compliance with all state requirements. We provide secure online document storage, a comprehensive to-do list that will make sure you don't miss any steps, a one-stop online business profile, and we make it easy to make payments and track your orders.
Benefit #4: $50,000 Corporate Veil Guarantee®
A 'corporate veil' is the shielding you get from forming an LLC or corporation. This shield protects thepersonal assets of shareholders or the LLC's members from personal liability for the debts or actions of the business. When you use incorporate.com to form your LLC online, we will process your paperwork for you. Then just follow our step-by-step checklist to keep your veil strong and qualify for the guarantee. If you followed our checklist and your LLC is sued and you are held personally liable because your corporate veil is pierced, we will reimburse legal defense fees up to $50,000.

How does forming an LLC help protect my personal assets?
Unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships, LLCs allow their owners to separate and protect their personal assets from business debts and liabilities. A sole proprietor or general partner remains personally liable for business obligations, leaving their home, car, and personal savings at risk.
In contrast, forming an LLC creates a business structure separate from its owners. In a properly formed and managed LLC, only business assets remain at risk in a judgment against the company. Owners can protect their personal savings and possessions from business debts.
Back to Top

How are LLC profits taxed?
Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC enjoys pass-through taxation. This means that owners (also known as "members") report their share of profits or losses in the company on their individual tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not assess taxes on the company itself. This avoids the "double taxation" that general, or "C," corporations experience. In a C corporation, the IRS taxes profits at the corporate level and dividends at the shareholder level.
When creating an LLC, owners need not distribute profits and losses in the LLC in proportion to ownership (pursuant to IRS guidelines). The owners of an LLC can agree to allocate the company's profits and losses among themselves however they see fit, not necessarily based on the percentage of the company each owner controls.
Back to Top

How does an LLC compare to a C Corporation?
For many small business owners, a Limited Liability Company (LLC) offers advantages over a "C" corporation (also known as a "general" corporation). Creating an LLC combines the tax advantages of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation.
The IRS taxes the profits of a C corporation at corporate tax rates. Then, if the C corporation pays dividends to shareholders, the IRS taxes those dividends a second time at the personal income tax rates of the shareholders. The LLC business structure avoids this "double taxation." The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider an LLC itself a taxable entity. Instead, the company's earnings "pass through" to the owners, who report their share of profits or losses on their individual tax returns.
Small business owners who want the flexible structure of an LLC but the advantages of corporate taxation can elect corporate taxation for their LLC. To elect corporate taxation, owners file Form 8832, "Tax Classification Election," with the IRS. Electing this status may also make an LLC eligible for certain deductions available only to corporations. For specific guidance, small business owners should consult their accountant or tax advisor regarding this election.
Back to Top

How does an LLC compare to an S Corporation?
The Limited Liability Company (LLC) and the Subchapter S Corporation ("S Corp") share the benefit of pass-through taxation. This means that owners in the company report their share of profits and losses on each owner's individual tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assesses no separate tax on the company itself. In contrast, "double taxation" occurs when the IRS taxes both a C Corporation's profit and dividends paid to shareholders.
Despite the similarity of pass-through taxation, an LLC formation can offer advantages over an S Corporation:

Not required to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes (though we recommend it)
LLC owners need not worry about the formalities of issuing stock, since an LLC does not have stock
No limit to the number of owners
LLC owners need not be U.S. citizens or permanent residents

Back to Top

What is a Series LLC?
A Series LLC consists of a Limited Liability Company with more than one series of members, managers, or LLC interests. In some cases, a series LLC can have a separate business purpose or investment objective. For years, Delaware law has permitted an LLC to register separate series. Use of this structure remains uncommon due to uncertainty over federal income tax consequences. Advantages include:

The Series LLC permits separate liability-insulated divisions within a single entity.
A Series LLC could be used as a holding company owning intangible assets, or tangible assets such as real estate, or as an operating company conducting different lines of business.
The Series LLC reduces costs associated with forming and maintaining multiple LLCs.

Other states that have enacted statutes permitting the formation and registration of series LLCs include Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah. To form a series LLC, contact a Business Specialist at 800-818-6082 (toll-free) or 302-636-5440
Back to Top

What state should I form my LLC in?
Most businesses form LLCs in the state in which they primarily operate. Advantages of choosing your home state include:

Typically the least complicated option
Usually costs less than forming your LLC in a different state and registering with your home state
Avoids paying franchise taxes and filing annual reports in more than one state

Many companies conduct business throughout the U.S. and abroad. An LLC with business locations in multiple states may form an LLC in a single state and then register to do business in the additional states. This means that companies must formally register, file annual reports, and pay annual fees to conduct business in multiple states.
Back to Top

How do I form an LLC?
incorporate.com can walk you through the process of your LLC formation either online or by telephone. Customers usually find our LLC formation services less expensive than those of an attorney. We have multiple packages and options to choose from to meet your individual budget and needs.
Creating an LLC takes less than 10 minutes. You simply need to choose a business structure, state, and your company name. We take care of the rest. Our experts have formed more than 300,000 businesses nationwide.
Back to Top

What do I need to do to maintain my LLC?
Nearly all states require LLCs to file annual reports or pay franchise taxes to maintain the company's good standing. The Secretary of State may forward a renewal notice directly to your company or to your Registered Agent. Failure to file reports and pay franchise taxes by the state deadline can result in fines, notices, and the inability to conduct business.
State laws do not require LLCs to hold annual meetings or record meeting minutes. However, we recommend that LLCs update their records at least annually to reflect any changes in management or activities.
Almost all state, county, and local governments require LLCs to complete business license, permit, and tax registration applications before beginning to operate. Learn more about how our Business License Compliance Package can help your company.
Back to Top

Can I use incorporate.com as a Registered Agent?
Yes, you can! We are happy to receive your legal documents and forward them to the person you designate as your legal contact. By creating your LLC online and using incorporate.com as your registered agent, you are provided peace of mind. Simply choose incorporate.com as your Registered Agent during the checkout process.
Back to Top

If I buy a package but want to customize and add services, is that possible?
Absolutely! Our advanced services are available for an additional fee with any of the lower packages. The additional services and resources available include an LLC Operating Agreement, a Legal and Tax reference library, the filing of an Employer Identification Number (EIN) with the IRS, and more!
Back to Top

I need additional help – can you give me more guidance?
We'd be happy to serve you. Even though you are forming your LLC online, any of our packages has the option of adding a one-on-one business coaching arrangement. For a simple fee, you'll have someone who can help you keep your LLC in good standing, protect yourself, and run a successful business.
Back to Top

I had some legal questions come up. Can you assist?
Not with legal questions. incorporate.com does not provide legal advice. Please consult with an attorney for any legal issues that arise with your LLC or business operations.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

99 Cents Only store, Murrieta, California


99 Cents Only Stores is an American price-point retailer chain based in Commerce, California. Previously, the store offered all products at 99¢ or less.[2] Most products are now priced at "99.99¢ or less, but certain products are sold at higher price points". Founded by David Gold on February 28, 1969, most of the stores are located in Southern California, with others in Nevada, Texas and Arizona. The company also operates Bargain Wholesale, which sells wholesale to retailers across the United States and exports to more than 15 countries from showrooms in Los Angeles. It also exhibits at trade shows in Las Vegas and Chicago.

History[edit]




99 Cents Only Store, North Hollywood, California


1980s[edit]
Gold first came up with the idea as a means to liquidate slow selling wines at his liquor store. "Whenever I'd put wine or cheese on sale for $1.02 or 98 cents, it never sold out," Gold said in 2001 interview with The Los Angeles Times. "When I put a 99 cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time. I realized it was a magic number."[3]
After prompting from a friend, he then created a full store of these bargains. To get publicity, he sold televisions for only 99 cents on the first day, then had family members calling TV stations to ask about the commotion caused by the lines. The practice continues today as a brand new 99 Cents Only Store will sell a high priced item for 99 cents to the first nine customers in line on opening day, and other limited prices for the next 90 new opening day customers. Despite its image, the company operates a basic information technology operation with a computer system ordering stockers in the distribution center and point of sale registers tracking purchases at every store.[4] The Texas distribution center is a former Albertsons facility bought when that company exited the Houston market.
2000s[edit]
In November 2003, a more flexible pricing structure was implemented where items are sold for prices lower than 99 cents (for example, 69 or 49 cents). The management believes that this will permit better management of commodity price increases.[5]
In September 2007, the company raised its highest price from 99 cents to 99.99 cents; the first increase in the history of the franchise—to combat "dramatically rising costs and inflation." However now the store carries select items that are over the .99 price point; such as $1.99 and $2.99.) [6]
Despite having announced on September 18, 2008, that the company would close all stores in Texas, in February 2009, the company decided that it will close only one-third of its Texas stores. The company quoted a rise in sales, and plans to keep the stores open, as long as the stores remain profitable.[7][8]
2010s[edit]
In October 2011, the company agreed to a $1.6 billion buy-out by private equity firm Ares Management and the CPP Investment Board. [9] The deal was completed on January 13, 2012. New ownership decided to lay off 172 plus employees, October 2013. [10] The Gold family ended their involvement with the company in January 2013.
Popular culture[edit]
99 Cents Only Stores advertises that it is open "9 days a week," often invoking humorous commentary on holidays with products sold for 99 cents. One advertisement wished Joan Rivers "Happy 99th Facelift"; another congratulated the Los Angeles "Dodgers on Losing 99 Games."[3] The company also celebrates the 99th birthday of public figures and names 99-year-old individuals as honorary spokespersons.
Photographer Andreas Gursky's diptych of the inside of the Hollywood, California 99 Cents Only store became - at the time - the most expensive photograph ever sold in February 2007, auctioned for $3.3 million.[11]

99 Cents Only store, Murrieta, California


99 Cents Only Stores is an American price-point retailer chain based in Commerce, California. Previously, the store offered all products at 99¢ or less.[2] Most products are now priced at "99.99¢ or less, but certain products are sold at higher price points". Founded by David Gold on February 28, 1969, most of the stores are located in Southern California, with others in Nevada, Texas and Arizona. The company also operates Bargain Wholesale, which sells wholesale to retailers across the United States and exports to more than 15 countries from showrooms in Los Angeles. It also exhibits at trade shows in Las Vegas and Chicago.

History[edit]




99 Cents Only Store, North Hollywood, California


1980s[edit]
Gold first came up with the idea as a means to liquidate slow selling wines at his liquor store. "Whenever I'd put wine or cheese on sale for $1.02 or 98 cents, it never sold out," Gold said in 2001 interview with The Los Angeles Times. "When I put a 99 cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time. I realized it was a magic number."[3]
After prompting from a friend, he then created a full store of these bargains. To get publicity, he sold televisions for only 99 cents on the first day, then had family members calling TV stations to ask about the commotion caused by the lines. The practice continues today as a brand new 99 Cents Only Store will sell a high priced item for 99 cents to the first nine customers in line on opening day, and other limited prices for the next 90 new opening day customers. Despite its image, the company operates a basic information technology operation with a computer system ordering stockers in the distribution center and point of sale registers tracking purchases at every store.[4] The Texas distribution center is a former Albertsons facility bought when that company exited the Houston market.
2000s[edit]
In November 2003, a more flexible pricing structure was implemented where items are sold for prices lower than 99 cents (for example, 69 or 49 cents). The management believes that this will permit better management of commodity price increases.[5]
In September 2007, the company raised its highest price from 99 cents to 99.99 cents; the first increase in the history of the franchise—to combat "dramatically rising costs and inflation." However now the store carries select items that are over the .99 price point; such as $1.99 and $2.99.) [6]
Despite having announced on September 18, 2008, that the company would close all stores in Texas, in February 2009, the company decided that it will close only one-third of its Texas stores. The company quoted a rise in sales, and plans to keep the stores open, as long as the stores remain profitable.[7][8]
2010s[edit]
In October 2011, the company agreed to a $1.6 billion buy-out by private equity firm Ares Management and the CPP Investment Board. [9] The deal was completed on January 13, 2012. New ownership decided to lay off 172 plus employees, October 2013. [10] The Gold family ended their involvement with the company in January 2013.
Popular culture[edit]
99 Cents Only Stores advertises that it is open "9 days a week," often invoking humorous commentary on holidays with products sold for 99 cents. One advertisement wished Joan Rivers "Happy 99th Facelift"; another congratulated the Los Angeles "Dodgers on Losing 99 Games."[3] The company also celebrates the 99th birthday of public figures and names 99-year-old individuals as honorary spokespersons.
Photographer Andreas Gursky's diptych of the inside of the Hollywood, California 99 Cents Only store became - at the time - the most expensive photograph ever sold in February 2007, auctioned for $3.3 million.[11]

99 Cents Only store, Murrieta, California


99 Cents Only Stores is an American price-point retailer chain based in Commerce, California. Previously, the store offered all products at 99¢ or less.[2] Most products are now priced at "99.99¢ or less, but certain products are sold at higher price points". Founded by David Gold on February 28, 1969, most of the stores are located in Southern California, with others in Nevada, Texas and Arizona. The company also operates Bargain Wholesale, which sells wholesale to retailers across the United States and exports to more than 15 countries from showrooms in Los Angeles. It also exhibits at trade shows in Las Vegas and Chicago.

History[edit]




99 Cents Only Store, North Hollywood, California


1980s[edit]
Gold first came up with the idea as a means to liquidate slow selling wines at his liquor store. "Whenever I'd put wine or cheese on sale for $1.02 or 98 cents, it never sold out," Gold said in 2001 interview with The Los Angeles Times. "When I put a 99 cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time. I realized it was a magic number."[3]
After prompting from a friend, he then created a full store of these bargains. To get publicity, he sold televisions for only 99 cents on the first day, then had family members calling TV stations to ask about the commotion caused by the lines. The practice continues today as a brand new 99 Cents Only Store will sell a high priced item for 99 cents to the first nine customers in line on opening day, and other limited prices for the next 90 new opening day customers. Despite its image, the company operates a basic information technology operation with a computer system ordering stockers in the distribution center and point of sale registers tracking purchases at every store.[4] The Texas distribution center is a former Albertsons facility bought when that company exited the Houston market.
2000s[edit]
In November 2003, a more flexible pricing structure was implemented where items are sold for prices lower than 99 cents (for example, 69 or 49 cents). The management believes that this will permit better management of commodity price increases.[5]
In September 2007, the company raised its highest price from 99 cents to 99.99 cents; the first increase in the history of the franchise—to combat "dramatically rising costs and inflation." However now the store carries select items that are over the .99 price point; such as $1.99 and $2.99.) [6]
Despite having announced on September 18, 2008, that the company would close all stores in Texas, in February 2009, the company decided that it will close only one-third of its Texas stores. The company quoted a rise in sales, and plans to keep the stores open, as long as the stores remain profitable.[7][8]
2010s[edit]
In October 2011, the company agreed to a $1.6 billion buy-out by private equity firm Ares Management and the CPP Investment Board. [9] The deal was completed on January 13, 2012. New ownership decided to lay off 172 plus employees, October 2013. [10] The Gold family ended their involvement with the company in January 2013.
Popular culture[edit]
99 Cents Only Stores advertises that it is open "9 days a week," often invoking humorous commentary on holidays with products sold for 99 cents. One advertisement wished Joan Rivers "Happy 99th Facelift"; another congratulated the Los Angeles "Dodgers on Losing 99 Games."[3] The company also celebrates the 99th birthday of public figures and names 99-year-old individuals as honorary spokespersons.
Photographer Andreas Gursky's diptych of the inside of the Hollywood, California 99 Cents Only store became - at the time - the most expensive photograph ever sold in February 2007, auctioned for $3.3 million.[11]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
