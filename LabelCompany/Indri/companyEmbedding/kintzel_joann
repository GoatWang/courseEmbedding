Success: JoAnn Kintzel 






Most find graduating in four years with a single major to be a challenge. JoAnn Kintzel ‘86 was more than ready to enter the working world and was determined to finish her schooling as quickly as she could, so she graduated in just three years—with a double major.
“Mount Mercy challenged me to become independent, to continue to learn and work well with others,” Kintzel said about her time as a student. “The institution also instilled important values and reinforced those passed on to me by my parents and siblings. Some of these values included treating others with respect, integrity and responsibility.”
The determination that led her to graduate with degrees in accounting and business administration also marked her career as she climbed the ranks as an accountant, eventually landing the coveted position she holds now.
“I oversee the entire operations of the TaxACT business unit,” Kintzel said. “The majority of TaxACT operations reside in Cedar Rapids with a small team of employees located in Bellevue, Washington.”
Kintzel started working as an accountant with Parsons Technology in Cedar Rapids in 1990, and served many roles in the company, ending her time there as the VP of Finance and Operations. She left in 2000 to work at AEGON USA Investment Management, where she stayed for three years.
During her time with AEGON, she was approached by the founders of 2nd Story Software—known for creating the widely used TaxACT program—to join their team as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer. Much in part to her work ethic, Kintzel was promoted in 2010 and now serves as president for Blucora’s TaxACT business unit.
Her advice to prospective students may give insight into the foundation of her success.
“Look for a college setting that provides a caring, challenging and fun environment to learn. Focus on what is right for you and seek a connection when you meet with staff and students. If surrounded by a supportive environment, you will have the tools to pave your path and take away the most from this learning experience.”
