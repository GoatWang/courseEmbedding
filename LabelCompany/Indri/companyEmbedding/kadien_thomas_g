Paper bag and carrier card for holding cups



Patent number:  5071007
                                            

Abstract:  A cup holder for use in combination with a paper bag. The cup holder is fashioned from a unitary blank of paperboard provided with a plurality of transversely extending fold lines. The blank is folded so as to assume the configuration of a tube open at both ends, with the free ends of the blank being glued together and projecting radially inwardly of the open tube. Two panels of the blank are each provided with an elliptical opening for receiving a cup. In use, the folded and glued blank is inserted into the open end of a conventional paperbag, so that the bottom of the holder is in surface contact with the bottom of the bag. Filled cups of a potable liquid, for example, are then each placed in its respective opening of the holder. The holder and the bag cooperate to rigidify the holder and define an easily carryable assembly.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

                        July 12, 1989

                                                        December 10, 1991
                        

Assignee:

Inventor: 
                                                                
                                Thomas G. Kadien

Patent number:  4934586
                                            

Abstract:  An arched clamshell type carton formed from a one piece blank of paperboard having cut lines and score lines. The bottom of the carton is square, with each of two opposite sidewalls having spaced apart, coplanar ears, each of the latter being semicircular. The other two opposite sidewalls of the bottom are elongated and are each bent around the edges of respective opposite, aligned ears. The ends of these latter walls carry hooks and also handle forming panels, the hooks being each engaged with a respective latching flap positioned between respective pairs of ears.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        August 28, 1989
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        June 19, 1990
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        International Paper Company
