About CFHP
Who We AreCommunity First Health Plans (CFHP) was established in 1995, by the University Health System, specifically to begin providing health care coverage to the citizens of Bexar and the surrounding seven counties. As the only locally owned and managed, non-profit health plan in the area, our commitment to our members is to provide great health care benefits backed by outstanding service, delivered by people who live right here in South Texas. Our goal is to make San Antonio have more successful health outcomes by putting the community first.What We DoFor over 20 years now, Community First has provided quality health care and has touched the lives of almost 700,000 unique individuals. We are proud to offer exceptional care for individuals and families, including children, quality prenatal care to expectant mothers, adults, and now special needs children. Community First is NCQA-accredited (National Committee for Quality Assurance), meaning our health plan has undergone rigorous processes and successful certification to ensure our standards allow us to provide the best quality services to our members and providers. Our goal is that our community has access to health care for all stages of life and the assurance of care for the unexpected, when most needed.Why We Do ItCommunity First operates at a grass-roots level, interacting with key community organizations to help identify and provide information to help families obtain the health care coverage they need. All the dollars received in our revenue stream are funneled directly back into the community to help our organization continue its mission of providing access to quality health care for San Antonio and the  surrounding seven counties.Community First CaresCommunity First is proud to partner with various organizations who share like-minded goals and objectives and who wholeheartedly support the needs of San Antonio’s diverse communities. Our partners include: Fall Ahead ContestThe Fall Ahead Contest was created to give local educators the chance to install lasting programs at their schools to benefit the health and well being of their students. In 2016, CFHP awarded seven educators across San Antonio who submitted their idea of a healthy, sustainable program for their school. Below is one of our Fall Ahead 2016 recipients who built five Ga-ga Ball pits for his students with his award funds.The goal of the Ga-ga Ball activity is for elementary students to work together in an active setting that promotes collaboration as a team and physical movement that accommodates various skill sets.Please note: CFHP has made every effort to provide  accurate   information about its products, services and provider  networks. Because this   information changes, you can verify information  by calling our Member Services   department.

Emergency Care:In a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest emergency room. Call your primary care physician as soon as possible after you get care. Your doctor can help you arrange follow-up care.Emergency medical condition means: a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of recent onset and sufficient severity (including severe pain), such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical care could result in:
Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy Serious impairment to bodily functions Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part Serious disfigurement In the case of a pregnant woman, serious jeopardy to the health of a woman or her unborn child.Urgent Care:Urgent medical care is when you are sick or hurt, and need help within 24 hours to keep from getting worse.

Q:


What do I do if I get a bill?

CFHP pays these providers under a fee schedule. These non-participating facility-based physicians and non-participating facility-based health care practitioners may balance bill the enrollee, which means receiving a bill from a provider for the reminder of the charges billed by the provider, for amounts not paid by the enrollee’s health benefit plan (Texas Insurance Code §1456.001,003).

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
