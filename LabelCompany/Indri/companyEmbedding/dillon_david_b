Kroger Veteran David B. Dillon Receives FMI Statesmanship Award






            Jan 24, 2015

        
January 24, 2015 – Miami, Florida – Food Marketing Institute (FMI) on Saturday presented its highest honor, the Sidney R. Rabb Award, to David B. Dillon, former chairman of the board of directors for The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR).  Dillon accepted the statesmanship award among his peers and industry colleagues at the FMI Midwinter Executive Conference in Miami. Dillon was recognized with the Rabb award for his excellence in serving the consumer, the community and the industry. Attributes used to describe him typically begin with “genuine,” and his earnestness translates across his career to a deep understanding of the importance of diversity in America and in the American workplace.  Recognizing his achievement and their longtime professional relationship, FMI President and CEO Leslie G. Sarasin remarked, “Dave is a respected leader in the larger food retail industry and consistently highlights the role of constructive feedback, believing that giving it establishes you as an informed leader and receiving it helps you become a better leader. A person of great vison and charisma, his passion for nurturing future leaders for the food retail industry was evident in his spearheading FMI’s 2013 Future Connect Conference, an event dedicated to developing those identified with leadership potential.” Dillon pledged and brought 200 Kroger employees to FMI Future Connect in 2013, saying, “I will be there, I’ll be taking notes, just like I did the last two times, and I’ll be learning, I hope hand-in-hand right along with you.” His leadership is reflected in the 37 years he dedicated to the food retail industry, focusing on nearly every aisle and role in the store. Dillon served as Kroger’s chairman from 2004 – 2014 and as chief executive officer from 2003 – 2013. Prior to that, he held a variety of executive positions at Kroger and Dillons Companies, which merged in 1983. Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chairman and chief executive officer, described Dillon as “a grocer’s grocer,” noting, “You are to me what the Rabb award is all about – somebody that cares about our industry, cares about people, and cares about Kroger and all the things in between.” Dillon was instrumental in developing Kroger’s “Customer 1st Strategy”, which today has resulted in 44 consecutive quarters of positive identical store sales growth. While Dillon served as CEO, Kroger increased revenue $45 billion, created 53,000 new jobs, reduced costs for eight consecutive years, and returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Kroger has also become a leader in supermarket sustainability under Dave’s leadership. Under his leadership, Kroger reduced energy consumption in stores by 33 percent since 2000 and its carbon footprint by 4.4 percent since 2006. Notably, more than half of the company’s 37 manufacturing facilities are zero waste. In 2011, Forbes Magazine recognized Kroger as the most generous company in America. Kroger’s efforts to feed families struggling with hunger grew to total contributions of 250 million meals – 4 million meals per week – annually.  Dillon’s regard for the community was arguably rooted in his appreciation for service and scouting. He received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 2012, and he continues to empower entrepreneurial future grocers mentoring Jayhawks at his alma mater, the University of Kansas, where he serves on the board of trustees of the University of Kansas Endowment.  Dillon is a member of the board of directors of DIRECTV and Union Pacific Corporation. He serves on the boards of the University of Cincinnati Foundation, the Urban League of Greater Cincinnati, and Catalyst. He was also an influential member of the Board of Directors of the Consumer Goods Forum and FMI.  Dillon’s loyalty and commitment is further exemplified in his family life. Dave has been married to Dee for 41 years. They currently reside in Kansas, and have three grown children and seven grandchildren.
