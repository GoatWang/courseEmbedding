                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  The 2012 Prudential Financial and General Motors $25.1B pension risk transfer transaction was the largest and most complex of its kind by an order of magnitude in the U.S. market and globally. A flawless execution on behalf of 110,000 former plan participants of the legacy GM Retirement Program for Salaried Employees required exceptional teamwork, sophisticated expertise in longevity risk, ALM, investments, pensions, a scalable plan administration infrastructure and relentless dedication to servicing excellence.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

 Recent papers by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL WHY DE-RISK?

Your path to heightened pension certainty may involve multiple phases, and will require careful planning. Your firm and its defined benefit pension plan are as unique as the ultimate de-risking journey you may take.

You may associate de-risking with times of market volatility, but you should know that pension risk transfer strategies designed and executed during periods of relative market stability can offer a prime opportunity to implement strategies to mitigate the risks of defined benefit debt obligations.
It’s time to re-think pension risk, and the time to transfer your plan’s risk is now.
FIVE REASONS TO TRANSFER YOUR PENSION RISK

Ultimately creates greater certainty of corporate cash flows.
Avoids potential funding surplus trap.
Takes advantage of rising funded status window of opportunity.
Timing—it can take many months to execute a pension risk transfer transaction depending on complexity, populations, type of transfer, portfolio allocation, and other factors.
Taps early mover advantages: access to finite insurer capital, operational capacity, and current pricing.

 
YOU MAY BE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK
Funded status is chief among the many factors to consider when determining how and when to de-risk.
In a rising interest rate environment, a plan's funded status can be volatile and windows of opportunity to act can be fleeting. During the first six months of 2013, U.S. corporate DB plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88 percent. Over the course of 2013, U.S. corporate Defined Benefit plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88.3 percent. (Milliman 100 Monthly Pension Funding Index)
Your pension’s funded status may be closer to 100 percent than you think, risking the possibility of trapped assets once you cross the 100 percent funded status threshold. Companies with modest underfunding of, or adequately funded, material pension liabilities are therefore in the prime window of opportunity to focus on de-risking and creating additional financial flexibility. Shifting pension risk to a qualified annuity provider may be more viable than ever. The scenario below illustrates the combination of discount rates and equity returns—and the resulting funded status.

S&P Maalot also upgraded Clal's rating to AA in July.



        
            The latest ratings published by "Globes" and Standard & Poor's Maalot The Israel Securities Rating Company Ltd. show Altshuler Shaham Provident Funds Ltd., Migdal Provident Fund Management Ltd. and Yelin Lapidot Investment House with an AA rating, the highest available. This reflects the same ratings as June. They are joined by Clal, which now has the same rating. The rating relates to the period between August 2005 and July 2008, and examines fund managers according to qualitative parameters, and includes provident funds and advanced training funds that have been operating for more than 36 months. The rating is based on S&P-Maalot's methodology and unlike other ratings does not relate purely to returns. The performance component represents only about 20% of the overall grading.   
        




Clal Gemel Ltd., a subsidiary of Clal Insurance Co. Ltd., continues to lead the rankings of the largest provident funds. The firm also saw its rating upgraded from A to AA. Clal Insurance acquired its provident funds from Israel Discount Bank (TASE: DSCT) including the Tamar fund, and its investments are managed for Clal Finance Management Ltd. by Roy Yakir, who also managed them at Israel Discount Bank. The other large funds ranked according to size were Psagot Gadish Provident Funds Ltd, Dash Provident Fund Management Ltd., and Harel Provident Funds. All received an A rating. Dash climbed from fifth place to third in July, overtaking Harel in fourth and Excellence Nessuah Provident Funds which slipped down to fifth place and has a BBB rating. The largest medium-sized provident funds in July were Ayalon Provident Funds, Analyst Provident Funds Ltd. and Altshuler Shaham. The small provident funds were led by Migdal and Yelin Lapidot. The large advanced-training fund rankings were topped by Harel and Dash, both with an A rating. Excellence Nessuah, which in June had headed the list, fell to third place while Clal Insurance was in fourth position.

                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  Pension risk transfer has long been viewed as a purely financial transaction involving a plan sponsor, its plan and an insurance company. Recently, however, plan sponsors have come to understand that an insurer’s service delivery capabilities are just as important as its financial strength and capacity.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

 Recent papers by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.
