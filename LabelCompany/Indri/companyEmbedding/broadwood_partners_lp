Why Broadwood Partners Lp Holds STAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ:STAA)

Purpose of Transaction








The Reporting Persons acquired their Shares of the Issuer for investment purposes.








The Reporting Persons have no plans or proposals which, other than as expressly set forth below, would relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of presently-owned securities of the Issuer; (b) any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer; (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; (f) any material change in the operating policies or corporate structure of the Issuer; (g) any change in the Issuer’s charter or by-laws; (h) the Shares of the Issuer ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in the over-the-counter security markets; or (i) causing the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Reporting Persons, however, reserve the right, at a later date, to effect one or more of such changes or transactions in the number of shares they may be deemed to beneficially own.










The Reporting Persons have been and may continue to be in contact with members of the Issuer’s management, the Issuer’s Board of Directors, other significant shareholders and others regarding alternatives that the Issuer could employ to improve shareholder value.








The Reporting Persons are encouraged by the recent changes to the Issuer’s management team, which they believe have improved the odds that the Issuer may successfully overcome its recent setbacks and realize its substantial long-term growth opportunity. In light of the recent management changes, and consistent with the Reporting Persons’ longstanding belief in the Issuer’s proprietary technology and substantial growth opportunity, the Reporting Persons recently increased their ownership of the Issuer’s shares by exercising their warrant to purchase additional shares for cash, rather than electing a cashless exercise.








However, the Reporting Persons have become concerned that while the Issuer’s management team has improved, its Board of Directors’ alignment with and representation of the Issuer’s shareholders has decreased. The Reporting Persons note that another shareholder recently suggested in a publicly-filed letter that the Board has not been appropriately responsive to his prior efforts to communicate with the Board despite his status as a shareholder of the Issuer, and alsoas a significant purchaser of the Issuer’s principal products,an ophthalmic surgeon, anda successful business executive in the Issuer’s most important target markets. Prior to the filing of that shareholder’s letter, other large shareholders of the Issuer had contacted the Reporting Persons to express their own growing concerns regarding the quality of the Issuer’s corporate governance, as well as the Board’s ability to effectively represent shareholders. The Reporting Persons share many of the concerns raised by these large shareholders, particularly with respect to the Board’s recent process for appointing and nominating directors. The Reporting Persons also note that since the date on which the Issuer announced the election of its current Chairman, the Issuer’s stock price has declined by 45%. Therefore, the Reporting Persons are considering what actions may need to be taken in order to improve the Board’s alignment with, and responsiveness to, the shareholders of the Issuer.
