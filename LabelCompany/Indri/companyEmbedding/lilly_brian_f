At Elanco, we provide those who raise and care for animals with solutions that empower them to advance a vision of food and companionship enriching life.
We understand the powerful role healthy animals play in making lives better. As pets increasingly become important parts of our families, so too does the need to help them live longer, healthier, higher-quality lives. As the global population grows, so too will the need to meet the demand for safe, affordable food for all.
Since our start at Eli Lilly and Company in 1954, Elanco has been working to empower our customers—from veterinarians to food producers to all those concerned with animal health—to address these global challenges, and advance a vision of food and companionship enriching life. We strive to develop and deliver products safe for consumers, animals and the environment through innovation and a shared vision to enrich the life of people worldwide.
Mission and Vision
Our Mission: We provide those who raise and care for animals with a comprehensive set of animal health products and knowledge services that empower them to address the global challenges of a diverse and changing world.
Our Vision: Food and Companionship Enriching Life
History
We are proud of our heritage of close customer relationships, scientific rigor and quality products, from the development of the first antibiotic for veterinary use in 1953 to today’s treatments that address the health needs of our pets. At the same time, we are humbled by the global challenges ahead and we will remain true to our heritage and our values to provide needed solutions in the field of animal health.
