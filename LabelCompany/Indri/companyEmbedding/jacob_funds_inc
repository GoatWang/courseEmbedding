Investment Process

  The portfolio managers follow a three-step process to identify and monitor the Fund's investments:


  Find


  The first step in our investment process is to narrow down the seemingly infinite universe of possibilities and to focus on what we feel are the most attractive opportunities. Accomplishing this step is no easy task. It requires countless hours of research - scouring the Web, reading analyst reports, running quantitative screens, attending conferences, speaking to executives - all in an attempt to find those relatively rare nuggets worth looking into more closely. Sometimes those nuggets are individual companies, and sometimes they are broader themes that can open up a wide range of potential investments.


  Filter


  Once we find an intriguing investment idea, we then deploy a thorough qualitative and quantitative review process to determine if the opportunity is as attractive as it appears and can be had at a fair price. Very few of our ideas that we uncover end up being part of our concentrated portfolios.


  Ideally, we are looking for companies that play in large markets in which there are significant barriers to entry, enjoy what we believe is a strong competitive position with growing market share, and boast capable management teams with proven track records. We want the companies to have unique assets - such as proprietary technologies or unusually loyal customers - with the possibility that positive near-term catalysts could drive the value of our investment higher.


  If everything looks good qualitatively, we turn our focus to valuation. We evaluate many different quantitative criteria including cash flows, income statement and balance sheet items. We determine what a company is likely to generate in sales and profits for the coming years and then, using several different metrics, calculate a fair valuation based on those estimates.


Of course, we also consider the biggest risks to each company's outlook and gauge the likelihood that these potential pitfalls could derail the investment thesis.


  Follow-Up


  Once we add an investment to one of our portfolios, we continue to monitor the position closely, making sure that our original analysis remains valid. We will often rebalance or potentially exit a position if the risk/reward ratio for the investment changes materially. We also conduct detailed portfolio reviews on a regular basis.




    There are specific risks inherent in investing in the Internet area, particularly with respect to smaller capitalized companies and the high volatility of internet stocks. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.

 Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. 
 There are risks inherent in investing in the Internet area, particularly with respect to smaller capitalized companies and the high volatility of internet stocks. Small- and Medium capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Internet Fund may invest in debt securities which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.

THE TEAM
INVESTMENT MANAGERS












Jacob Fund’s experienced investment team share core values that support integrity, performance, innovation, and trust. Through hard work, open communication, and rigorous discussion, the team establishes an abundance of data to help drive sound investment decisions.
      











Ryan Jacob
Chairman & Chief Investment Officer



Ryan Jacob is the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Jacob Asset Management, which he founded in 1999. He is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the firm, guiding his team in developing financial models, conducting market research and selecting stocks. He has served as the chief portfolio manager for the Jacob Internet Fund and Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund since both Funds’ inceptions in 1999 and 2010.
          









At age 29, Mr. Jacob was among the youngest individuals ever to launch a mutual fund – the Jacob Internet Fund. And for two decades Mr. Jacob has been at the forefront of technology investing, spanning a period that included one of history’s most profitable markets as well as the stunning crashes of 2002 and 2008.
                
A founding partner of Horizon Asset Management in 1994, a New York-based investment advisory firm, Mr. Jacob directed research and analysis for IPO Value Monitor during the period when Internet companies began to go public. In 1997 he took over portfolio management for The Internet Fund (currently Kinetics Internet Fund), one of the first funds focused on publicly-traded Internet companies, which he headed until 1999. From 1992-1994, he was an assistant portfolio manager at Banker’s Trust.
                
His philosophy embraces companies and industries that offer what he identifies as “game-changing” opportunities. In 2000, Crain’s New York Business named Mr. Jacob one of its “40 under 40,” stating “he stunned the investment world by turning the obscure Internet Fund into the top-performing mutual fund of 1998.” ii News, a publication of Institutional Investor, named him one of the Rising Stars of Mutual Funds in 2009.
                
Mr. Jacob is frequently quoted by the press for his insights into analyzing and assessing market opportunities for start-up companies as well as for established leaders across a broad mix of industries. He has appeared on CNBC, CNN, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business and has been profiled in Barron’s and Forbes and interviewed by nearly every major online and print business publication including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Investor’s Business Daily, Smart Money, Business Week and Fortune.

With over forty years of investment management experience, Mr. Alexander employs a value-oriented investing style, maintaining a long-term perspective and looking for companies with an enduring competitive advantage and a history of high returns on invested capital. Today, Mr. Alexander assists in the day-to-day management of the Jacob Internet Fund and the Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund.
              









Mr. Alexander began his career managing funds for trusts, foundations and charitable institutions, which has continued since launching his own firm, Alexander Capital Management, in 1985. As a partner at Kinetics Asset Management, he became the Chief Portfolio Manager of one of the first Internet funds (The Internet Fund, now Kinetics Internet Fund) at its inception in 1996. He continued as a portfolio manager assisting Ryan Jacob when Jacob assumed responsibility as Chief Portfolio Manager of the fund at the end of 1997. Mr. Alexander was also a portfolio manager with Lepercq, de Neuflize & Co. Inc., from 1998 to 2002.
                    
Concurrently, in 1999, Mr. Alexander assisted Mr. Jacob in founding Jacob Asset Management and launching a new mutual fund – Jacob Internet Fund. In addition to serving as Chief Portfolio Manager of the Wisdom Fund, Mr. Alexander assists in the day-to-day management of the Jacob Internet Fund and the Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund.

Darren Chervitz
Portfolio Manager & Director of Research



Darren Chervitz serves as the Chief Portfolio Manager of the Micro Cap Growth Fund as well as the Director of Research and Co-Portfolio Manager of the Jacob Internet Fund and the Jacob Small Cap Growth Fund. He joined Jacob Asset Management shortly after the firm was founded in 1999.
                









Mr. Chervitz’s primary responsibilities include evaluating existing holdings, helping to find new opportunities, reviewing portfolio weightings and providing ongoing risk assessment. His education and experience in the field of journalism – he is a graduate of Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism – have given him the perspective and investigative skills needed to dig through mountains of available information to find the most relevant content while asking the tough questions. He has been extensively quoted by various publications and networks, including appearing as a guest host on CNNfn and CNBC.
                       
Previously, Mr. Chervitz was one of the first employees at MarketWatch.com’s predecessor, DBC News, an online financial news organization founded in 1996. While there, his primary areas of focus were initial public offerings and Internet stocks; his IPO Report became one of the most popular editorial features on CBS.MarketWatch.com. He also delivered a daily market report on the morning news show for the local CBS-TV affiliate in San Francisco and was a regular technology analyst for ZDTV.
                       
Mr. Chervitz published a four-part investor education piece, The ABCs of IPOs, which was featured at the Museum of Financial History and continues to appear throughout the Web.

HISTORY
OUR BEGINNINGS










After running one of the earliest and most successful mutual funds focused exclusively on the emerging Internet economy, Ryan Jacob struck out on his own in 1999 to found the eponymous firm. Based in Los Angeles, California, with offices in New York and Florida,  Jacob Asset Management today provides investment solutions for both retail and institutional clients through three distinct vehicles – the Jacob Internet Fund (JAMFX); Small Cap Growth Fund (JSCGX), and Micro Cap Growth Fund (JMCGX).
      

With varied backgrounds and an average 25+ years of investment experience, JAM’s portfolio managers provide insights and expertise into the Internet and technology sectors, as well an increasing number of other industries. Fine-tuning a proprietary investment process over the years, JAM now offers funds which include a wide range of sectors and market capitalizations. But the goal at Jacob Asset Management remains what it was the first day Ryan Jacob opened the company’s doors: Find unique, exciting and enduring companies that have the potential to create significant value for both the global economy and their investors, broadening its offerings from the Jacob Internet Fund to include the Jacob Small Cap Fund & Jacob Micro Cap Fund.

       Prospectus
      




















 Please note that the Jacob Funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to United States residents, and the information on this website is intended only for such people. The Fund is not offered for sale in countries other than the U.S. and it territories. This website should not be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Jacob Funds in any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful under the securities law of that jurisdiction. 
 Each fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other information are described in the prospectuses, which must be read and considered carefully before investing. You may download the prospectus or obtain a hard copy by calling 888-522-6239. 
 Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. 
 There are risks inherent in investing in the Internet area, particularly with respect to smaller capitalized companies and the high volatility of internet stocks. Small- and Medium capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The Internet Fund may invest in debt securities which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.  
 Jacob Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
