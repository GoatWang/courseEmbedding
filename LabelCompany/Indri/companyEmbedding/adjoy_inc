TAMPA, Florida -- May 2, 2016 -- mynfo, Inc., an innovative new media platform for marketers and consumers, announced today it has closed $6.8 million in Series A financing led by Almaz Capital. Ross Hangebrauck, Almaz Capital Managing Director, will join the mynfo board of directors. The mynfo platform will launch this year in two Top 25 media markets. Funds from the investment will be used to scale the platform to additional markets throughout the US.“Marketers spend billions of dollars every year trying to understand and influence millions of consumers through advertising distributed on television, online and mobile networks. Yet an increasing number of those same consumers are choosing ad-free content,” said Susan O’Neal Gear, mynfo’s founder and CEO. “Consumers don’t hate advertising; they dislike how the advertising is distributed.”The broadcast media model first introduced in the 1940’s was an efficient way to create brand equity because consumers had fewer content choices. Today, technology has not only given consumers more choice about what content they consume; they can also choose whether or not advertising is going to be part of the experience. As a result, media models built on the over seventy year old concept of impressions have lost value both to marketers and consumers. 
According to an April 2016 report by Accenture, 84% of digital consumers complain that advertising too frequently interrupts their content consumption, 40% plan to remove these interruptions either via paid subscription or ad blocking software in the next twelve months. Frustration is even higher among younger consumers. “Consumers don’t want to be targets. They want and expect to be valued partners,” explained Gear.   
New mynfo Board Member Hangebrauck concurs adding, “We have been actively investing in entrepreneurs and startups that bring a unique competitive advantage to this sector. mynfo has identified and addressed an important need for consumers and marketers alike and developed a platform that will deliver real value to both.”   
Gear’s passion for mynfo and its mission of transforming the consumer to marketer relationship is shared by her co-founders, former Quotient executive Shachar “Shock” Torem, serving as Chief Client Officer, and veteran startup technologist Marvin Scaff, serving as Chief Technology Officer. About MynfoAt mynfo, we believe that every moment of every life has value. Honoring that truth creates a unique opportunity for marketers and consumers to invest in mutually respectful and mutually beneficial connections with each other that increase in value over time. The mynfo platform makes these connections easy for consumers, scalable for marketers and valuable for both.  Mynfo is headquartered in Tampa, Fla.

At Adjoy, we’re committed to improving mobile gaming experiences in the twenty-first century.
We transform native mobile game advertising like banners and pop-ups that distract from gameplay into engaging, value-packed experiences for end users and revenue-generating opportunities for advertisers and developers.
With the power of Adjoy, we make ads feel less like ads and more like an integral, interactive part of gameplay -- because that’s exactly what they are. Our self-service ad platform makes it possible to embed daily deals, promotions, and coupons into things like checkpoints, power-ups, enemies, and other collectible objects that function as part of native gameplay.
It’s our philosophy that mobile games should be fun, free to play, and actually reward the end user while ensuring developers benefit economically without having to sacrifice those fundamental values for their users -- and that’s exactly what Adjoy delivers.
Read on to discover how Adjoy is completely revolutionizing the mobile games industry by creating an all new standard in interactive-based monetization.

 













Banner ads detract from a game’s intellectual property. As a result, they’re often only an option for the most simplistic games from indie developers.

Video based reward ads are currently one successful alternative, but these ads still remove the user from the immersive gaming experience.

Pop-up ads… well, what else is there to say about pop-ups other than that everyone knows they’re the worst.
The bottom line: current methods of advertising in video games are all extremely frustrating to the end user. And this directly contributes to the ROI advertisers see -- or rather don’t see -- on mobile game ads.
Things have gotten so bleak that the only ads that advertisers are actually willing to spend money on in mobile games is other mobile games! Anything else, like retail products that users actually want, continually fall flat and drive away users.
The big takeaway?
Users aren’t having fun & they’re losing interest
Advertisers are losing ROI
Game developers are losing value in their intellectual property
Adjoy is on a quest to make monetization for game developers a much better experience, a positive experience that carriers over to the gamers who are able to enjoy games while still being advertised to in a non-invasive, yet much more effective way. 













Adjoy isn’t some far-fetched idea about the future of mobile gaming and advertising: we’ve already successful proven our concept with our working prototype.
The Lowest Cost Per Install
When marketing our games, we have only had to spend on average $0.25 per user install. This means for every 1,000 users, advertisers are only spending a marketing budget of around $250. This is nearly unheard of, as the usual cost is closer to $1.50 per install with other games.

 
User Retention Rates Skyrocket!
One of our games jumped from a 7th day user retention rate (average amount of people who still have the game download after 7 days) of 3%, to a whopping 45% once Adjoy offers and rewards were enabled in the game. 45% is HUGE; major companies only get about 25% retention rate for even the Gold Standard of games. Users love the experience of winning real world prizes, and they show it by going back for more and more!
Rewards Proven to Drive Traffic
On average, about 12% of the offers distributed in Adjoy are redeemed. This number might not sound high, but it is revolutionary to any marketer who knows typical redemption rates are usually a paltry 1-2%.
With proven stats like this, choosing Adjoy for your mobile game advertising is a no-brainer! 












Because games are traditionally developed using numerous tools and development environments, creating an API that allows any third party designer to build a game using our tech would normally pose some difficulties.

Developers can now simply point and choose objects in their game, wrap an image or logo around it, and instantly make it an in-game ad that the user is able to interact with. When the user interacts with the object during gameplay, a coupon is distributed from the advertiser directly into the user’s digital wallet.
When the user is done playing, they go to the wallet screen of the game, view their outstanding offers, select one, and are guided to the participating redemption location via Google/Apple maps. The user then receives even more in-game rewards for redeeming their coupon, such as gems which can be spent on power-ups, thus perpetuating gameplay incentive and engagement. 













OUR MVP WAS WITH 7 ADVERTISERS IN REDDING, CALIFORNIA
Their ads were geographically placed within a game we made called “Piggy Bankz”.


We will be launching out of our private beta shortly. During this time, we’ve put together two amazing testimonial videos on our website, one featuring a local Papa John's owner, and another featuring the owner of Rare Air, a trampoline park. (Note that these are the business owners, i.e. the advertisers who target our users).
We are currently developing our advertiser network in Sacramento. We have 100 advertiser pre-signups for the area, to whom we will give a one-month free trial. These advertisers represent pipelined revenue of $5,000 to $10,000. We should be able to convert them to paying customers by mid/late November.
A significant portion of our go-to-market strategy involves partnerships. We will target partnerships with companies such as Yelp to white label our ad portal and get in front of established local advertiser platforms. We have already established a relationship with Yelp’s head of business development, and he wants to integrate our platform once it is live.

Gamifying Advertising is the Future
We are currently launching our advertising platform in the simplest form possible – however, there are nearly endless variations on the overarching concept of ‘’Gamifying Advertising.”

Adjoy Kicks Off Seed Round with Initial Investment from Shasta Angels




                                    September 7, 2016                                


                                        Ben Briceno                                    

Press


Redding, CA – Adjoy, Inc., a tech start-up focused on changing the way advertising works in mobile games, recently announced they have kicked off their seed round with an investment from local investment group Shasta Angels. Adjoy is raising a total of $750,000, and the fundraising round potentially values the company at $5 million, although because Adjoy is in an early stage of development, investors have chosen to delay a firm valuation until a later, more robust investment in the company can be made.
Led by a team of ambitious entrepreneurs, Adjoy has set its sights on a lofty goal – removing banner ads from mobile games entirely. Instead of banners, Adjoy wants to see a world of in-game advertising, where game objects become collectable, real world coupons.
Based in Redding, Adjoy currently operates out of the Shasta Venture Hub. An incubator for emerging start-ups in the Redding area, the Hub is excited to have Adjoy as one of their resident companies. “They are taking advertising that was once bothersome, and turning it into something that is engaging and beneficial,” says Hope Seth, who is the Marketing and Entrepreneurial Development Director of the Venture Hub.
Currently, Adjoy is in the production phase of building a suite of developer tools which will allow any Unity 3D developer to select in-game objects to become Adjoy enabled. Doing so will be a huge benefit to indie and mid-range game studios, who put up with banner ads as a way to pay their bills. Adjoy offers a competitive monetization platform that promises to enhance gameplay, instead of detract from it, as banner ads often do.
Adjoy is aggressively pursuing a market release of their minimal viable product, which they hope to see active in the Sacramento Area by the end of September (2016). The private beta will give Adjoy real world traction and help them hone in on user behavior, as well as collect key metrics they will need as they integrate their software with much larger development firms.
