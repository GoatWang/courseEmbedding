All Royal Teak quality teakwood products are manufactured from Java teakwood specially 
The frame construction of the Royal Teak Garden furniture collection is the most rugged and long-lasting type.  All joinery is mortise and tenon, further reinforced by dowel joints or metal screws.
Elegantly functional and gracefully lined early 19th century English garden style inspires the classic design of Lanza's teakwood furniture, perfectly suited for the most casual to the most sophisticated decor. 
Teakwood is renowned for its strength, its durability and its beauty. Teakwood is heavily saturated with natural oils, allowing it to withstand the extremes of all climates. Cold temperatures and moisture deepen and mellow its rich hue, creating the famous weathered appearance typical of old teakwood furniture. 
To maintain the luster and color of your teakwood furniture, Lanza recommends occasional applications of teak oil, especially if the furniture is permanently exposed to direct sunlight and/or rain.

Bathroom furniture consists of different specialized pieces that can add storage, functionality, and style to one of the most useful rooms in any home. While many might not think of a bathroom as a space where one would typically put pieces of furniture, there are actually a huge range of helpful additions that can make any bathroom more organized and cohesive.


One of the largest furniture pieces in many bathrooms is the vanity. A bathroom vanity holds the bathroom sink (or sinks) and can range from a compact floating unit to a vanity of a substantial size, featuring drawers and cabinets for storage. There are huge variety of bathroom vanity styles from sleek modern pieces to classic or transitional looks, any of which can add a distinct design tone to your space. 


Bathroom storage pieces are another very popular type of bathroom furniture. Many bathrooms do not have a lot of extra floor space, so bathroom cabinets or shelves tend to be either tall and narrow, or wall mounted. There are also a variety of flexible over the toilet storage options that can make use of the otherwise wasted space above the toilet tank. A shelving unit or linen cabinet in any of these configurations can add valuable storage space for everything from towels, washcloths, or soap, to make-up or cleaning supplies. Alternately, if you’re looking for something more petite, a medicine cabinet can provide great wall mounted or recessed storage for smaller items. 


Of course, no bathroom is complete without a suitable mirror. So we offer a full range of stylish and functional mirror designs from modern bathroom vanity mirrors to traditional styles of framed mirrors and even specialized make-up mirrors.


Whatever you need to complete your bathroom design, shop our great selection of bathroom furniture to find the perfect pieces!

Faucets









 





Bathroom Faucets (1,379)Shower Heads (731)Shower Sets (627)Shower Trims (733)Bathtub Faucets (844)Faucets Top Sellers

































    Faucets are crucial fixtures in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and just about any other spaces that feature water usage of some kind. themine.com
    provides a huge selection of faucets and plumbing hardware unrivaled by traditional faucet stores. With our collection of over 5,000 different faucets for
    you to choose from, including all the best faucet brands like Moen, American Standard, and Delta Faucet, you are sure to find the ideal fittings for your
    space.


    These fixtures are made in a wide range of specialized designs that can accommodate different spaces and uses. Some of the most used types include kitchen
    faucets, bathroom faucets, bathtub faucets, and utility sink faucets:



Kitchen faucets
        are designed for flexibility and functionality as well as bold aesthetics. These fixtures are meant to handle tough jobs and frequent usage, but also
        intended to complement one of the most used spaces in your home. They can incorporate useful features such as retractable sprayers or touch or motion
        activated control. We also have a few additional kitchen faucet types that can supplement your spaces with additional convenience features such as
        water filtration or water cooling.
    

Utility sink faucets
        are, as you would expect, much more utilitarian than other sink designs. They are typically quite sturdy in construction and sized to be proportional
        to large utility sinks for use in laundry rooms or garages. For ease of use, many
        of the laundry and utility faucets also come with sprayer attachments that can help with cleaning tough messes.
    

Bathroom faucets
        are typically much lower profile than kitchen faucets, merely because they are mostly for hand washing, and don’t require the clearance for dishes or
        other large items underneath. But just because they are smaller does not mean that they can’t also have a big impact on the space stylistically. We
        offer bathroom faucets in a huge range of designs and expressive finishes such as shiny chrome, dark oil rubbed bronze, and sophisticated polished
        nickel.
    

Bathtub faucets
        , also sometimes referred to as tub fillers, are the standard faucets used for every bathtub installation. They are much bigger and have a higher water
        output than any sink faucet would, as they have a much more sizable vessel to fill. Tub faucets come in a range of designs such as roman tub faucets,
        waterfall faucets, and clawfoot tub fillers, among others, to complement different bath arrangements and preferences.
    


For more information on sink faucets, check out our    faucet installation guide that gives crucial insight and
    helpful step-by-step DIY instructions for tackling this plumbing update.

About Lucio Lanzabecky_lanza2015-12-03T03:22:48+00:00 
About Lucio Lanza

Lucio Lanza, Managing Director of Lanza techVentures, is a strategist, visionary, leader and technology investor with an uncanny ability to identify and mentor promising technologists as they develop their ideas. With an intuitive knowledge of technology and a keen eye for talent, Lucio cares about the entrepreneurs and startup founders he invests with, and knows how to deftly foster their invention from concept to completion. His keen insights, clear vision, innovative thinking and vast network of business relationships with executives of multinational corporations enable him to reimagine the future to influence, motivate and inspire. He has helped transform countless startups into high-value computer design software and semiconductor companies.
The EDA Consortium (EDAC) and the IEEE Council on EDA (CEDA) acknowledged Lucio’s contributions to the industry by awarding him the 2014 Phil Kaufman Award for Distinguished Contributions to EDA. He was selected for his substantial impact through his strategic and financial assistance to innovative EDA companies.
Lucio joined venture capital firm U.S. Venture Partners in 1990 as a venture partner and general partner, while serving as an independent consultant to companies in the semiconductor, communications and EDA industries, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc. He further increased his focus on accelerating the pace of computer and chip design by forming Lanza techVentures in 2001.
Lucio’s Early Career
From 1986 to 1989, Lucio was chief executive officer of EDA Systems, Inc. He was previously vice president of marketing and served as general manager of the EDA division of Daisy Systems Corp. From 1977 to 1983, he worked for Intel Corp., holding positions responsible for strategy and innovation, including chairman of the microprocessor strategic business segment. Lucio was employed by Olivetti Corporation from 1968 to 1977 and was responsible for processor architecture and design.
A co-founder of Radnorwood Capital, LLC., an investor in public technology companies, he serves today as its co-general partner and technology strategist. Lucio is chairman of the board of PDF Solutions, Inc., a provider of technologies to improve semiconductor manufacturing yields, and is on the board of directors of several private companies. Formerly, he was a non-executive director of ARM, the world’s leading semiconductor IP company, and member of the board of directors of Harris & Harris Group, an investor in transformative companies enabled by disruptive science.
Lucio holds a doctorate in electronic engineering from Politecnico in Milan, Italy.
“Lucio had a true gift for anticipating the products and technologies that would soon be needed by our customers. Sometimes his insights were controversial but his predictions were always right on. His skills allowed Cadence to establish more effective product roadmaps and to identify and execute strategic, high-value acquisitions. Thanks to his help, we were able to build and confidently grow our position as a technology and business leader.
“. . . These days, when I talk to a young EDA or IP startup I hear about Lucio. He is still out there, and more active than ever, working with the industry’s most promising entrepreneurs, nurturing new ideas and teaching new founding teams. He is keeping our industry fed with a steady stream of innovation, new ideas and energy. So in a very practical sense, it is Lucio’s vision and drive that powers today’s EDA industry and plots its future. And for this, we are all very fortunate.”
— Joe Costello
Former CEO
Cadence Design Systems
“Denali was privately funded and we never accepted venture investment. In spite of that, Lucio was very generous with his time and advice during all my days running Denali. I like to think that he was one of my most influential mentors.”
— Sanjay Srivastava
Founder and CEO
Denali Software, Inc., now part of Cadence Design Systems
“Most of us in the industry are aware of Lucio’s qualifications as a visionary, leader and technology investor.
“. . . He has an uncanny ability to identify promising young technologists and to provide much needed mentoring as they develop their ideas and bring them to market.
“. . . The service that he provides to the companies that he mentors is invaluable to the world’s semiconductor industry. Progress in our industry depends on vision and new ideas. Many of the most important semiconductor technologies developed over the last 20 years or more, can be directly traced to Lucio.”
— Dr. John E. Kelly III
Senior Vice President and Director of Research
IBM Corporation

All of their products are made of the finest wood in elegant designs that are both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. 
All Royal Teak quality teakwood products are manufactured from Java teakwood specially 
The frame construction of the Royal Teak Garden furniture collection is the most rugged and long-lasting type.  All joinery is mortise and tenon, further reinforced by dowel joints or metal screws.
Elegantly functional and gracefully lined early 19th century English garden style inspires the classic design of Lanza's teakwood furniture, perfectly suited for the most casual to the most sophisticated decor. 
Teakwood is renowned for its strength, its durability and its beauty. Teakwood is heavily saturated with natural oils, allowing it to withstand the extremes of all climates. Cold temperatures and moisture deepen and mellow its rich hue, creating the famous weathered appearance typical of old teakwood furniture. 
To maintain the luster and color of your teakwood furniture, Lanza recommends occasional applications of teak oil, especially if the furniture is permanently exposed to direct sunlight and/or rain.

Bathroom furniture consists of different specialized pieces that can add storage, functionality, and style to one of the most useful rooms in any home. While many might not think of a bathroom as a space where one would typically put pieces of furniture, there are actually a huge range of helpful additions that can make any bathroom more organized and cohesive.


One of the largest furniture pieces in many bathrooms is the vanity. A bathroom vanity holds the bathroom sink (or sinks) and can range from a compact floating unit to a vanity of a substantial size, featuring drawers and cabinets for storage. There are huge variety of bathroom vanity styles from sleek modern pieces to classic or transitional looks, any of which can add a distinct design tone to your space. 


Bathroom storage pieces are another very popular type of bathroom furniture. Many bathrooms do not have a lot of extra floor space, so bathroom cabinets or shelves tend to be either tall and narrow, or wall mounted. There are also a variety of flexible over the toilet storage options that can make use of the otherwise wasted space above the toilet tank. A shelving unit or linen cabinet in any of these configurations can add valuable storage space for everything from towels, washcloths, or soap, to make-up or cleaning supplies. Alternately, if you’re looking for something more petite, a medicine cabinet can provide great wall mounted or recessed storage for smaller items. 


Of course, no bathroom is complete without a suitable mirror. So we offer a full range of stylish and functional mirror designs from modern bathroom vanity mirrors to traditional styles of framed mirrors and even specialized make-up mirrors.


Whatever you need to complete your bathroom design, shop our great selection of bathroom furniture to find the perfect pieces!

Bathroom Faucets (1,379)Shower Heads (731)Shower Sets (627)Shower Trims (733)Bathtub Faucets (844)Faucets Top Sellers

































    Faucets are crucial fixtures in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and just about any other spaces that feature water usage of some kind. themine.com
    provides a huge selection of faucets and plumbing hardware unrivaled by traditional faucet stores. With our collection of over 5,000 different faucets for
    you to choose from, including all the best faucet brands like Moen, American Standard, and Delta Faucet, you are sure to find the ideal fittings for your
    space.


    These fixtures are made in a wide range of specialized designs that can accommodate different spaces and uses. Some of the most used types include kitchen
    faucets, bathroom faucets, bathtub faucets, and utility sink faucets:



Kitchen faucets
        are designed for flexibility and functionality as well as bold aesthetics. These fixtures are meant to handle tough jobs and frequent usage, but also
        intended to complement one of the most used spaces in your home. They can incorporate useful features such as retractable sprayers or touch or motion
        activated control. We also have a few additional kitchen faucet types that can supplement your spaces with additional convenience features such as
        water filtration or water cooling.
    

Utility sink faucets
        are, as you would expect, much more utilitarian than other sink designs. They are typically quite sturdy in construction and sized to be proportional
        to large utility sinks for use in laundry rooms or garages. For ease of use, many
        of the laundry and utility faucets also come with sprayer attachments that can help with cleaning tough messes.
    

Bathroom faucets
        are typically much lower profile than kitchen faucets, merely because they are mostly for hand washing, and don’t require the clearance for dishes or
        other large items underneath. But just because they are smaller does not mean that they can’t also have a big impact on the space stylistically. We
        offer bathroom faucets in a huge range of designs and expressive finishes such as shiny chrome, dark oil rubbed bronze, and sophisticated polished
        nickel.
    

Bathtub faucets
        , also sometimes referred to as tub fillers, are the standard faucets used for every bathtub installation. They are much bigger and have a higher water
        output than any sink faucet would, as they have a much more sizable vessel to fill. Tub faucets come in a range of designs such as roman tub faucets,
        waterfall faucets, and clawfoot tub fillers, among others, to complement different bath arrangements and preferences.
    


For more information on sink faucets, check out our    faucet installation guide that gives crucial insight and
    helpful step-by-step DIY instructions for tackling this plumbing update.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
