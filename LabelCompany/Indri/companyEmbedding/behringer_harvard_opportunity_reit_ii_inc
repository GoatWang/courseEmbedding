ADDISON, Texas, Dec. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Behringer announced today that the board of directors of Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II, Inc. has authorized a $38.4 million, or $1.50 per share, special cash distribution. The special cash distribution is payable on January 5, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2015.
"Once again, we are very pleased to announce this special cash distribution and we intend to make additional special distributions as the company's assets are fully cycled," said Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II Chairman, Bob Aisner.
In accordance with Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II's valuation policy, as assets are sold, the estimated share value (ESV) will be reduced by the amount of any special cash distributions paid to shareholders. Therefore, the ESV will be adjusted to $7.69 on the December 31, 2015 record date.

Behringer: Roots in Music and Engineering
With over two decades in the music retail industry, Behringer is best known for producing a wide range of musical tools at affordable prices. What is less well known is the passion for music that drives the founder, Uli Behringer. Born into a musical household, Uli learned to play piano at the age of four. By the age of 16, he had designed and built his first synthesizer keyboard (the UB-1). Later Uli would go on to study both classical piano and audio engineering, setting the foundation for his namesake company in 1989.
Products Anyone Can Afford
Being a musician and an engineer, Uli Behringer's philosophy is to provide tools any musician or engineer could afford. Behringer equipment quickly became known as a cost-effective alternative to well-known industry-standard equipment. From effects processors, equalizers, and compressors to microphone preamplifiers, direct boxes, and mixing consoles, it was clear that Behringer aimed to become a permanent player in the music retail industry. It's even arguable that the affordability and variety of Behringer products played a huge role in the hobbyist recording market as we know it today.
From Studio to Stage and Beyond
In 1996, Behringer made big waves in the audio industry with the EURODESK MX8000 mixing console, delivering features of boards costing almost twice as much. That would mark Behringer's dedication to producing live sound equipment for practically any application. Beyond mixers and speakers, Behringer would also go on to develop a wide range of feedback elimination solutions, rackmount digital processors, analog crossovers, microphones, DJ mixers, and much more. By the early 2000s, many aspiring musicians and engineers had Behringer to thank for creating gear they could afford and grow with.
Recognized by Musicians and Engineers Worldwide
In 2002, Behringer consolidated 10 separate production facilities into one single factory in China, dubbed Behringer City. Since then, they have continued to expand their product range while maintaining affordable prices. Products such as the X32 series of digital mixers, the Bugera family of tube guitar amplifiers, and the Eurolive series of powered PA speakers offer powerful yet affordable tools for musicians, live sound mixers, studio engineers and broadcast audio.
