Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

          Creating Progress, Together 
      


Together, we are committed to making a significant, positive impact for patients and society through innovative programs that aim to improve access to treatment, advance disease understanding, and create true partnership with the community.
Our commitment to that purpose is reflected in our name.
“Bio” refers to our legacy of scientific innovation, which we will build upon, and “ver” refers to the Latin word veritas, meaning truth. “Ativ” is based on the word active —we will actively work with the community build trust and create change for patients.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.

Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.
