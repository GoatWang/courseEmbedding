We had very specific needs that were proving difficult to meet in an evolving real estate market. Frustrated with our own efforts we recruited Ready Real Estate and the level of service was OUTSTANDING. Ready Real Estate took the time to get to know us and our needs and helped us find a perfect match. We were extremely impressed with the level of professionalism and depth of market knowledge. I would not hesitate to use this service again in the future.Ready Real Estatereview1966 ratedAs retires downsizing we hired Ready Real Estate to sell our house and we couldn't be more pleased with their service.  They took the guessing out of the equation by informing us of the process and addressing our concerns.  Our house sold quickly and we were pleased to get frequent updates throughout the sale.  Ready Real Estate operates efficiently, they handle everything in a timely manner and they work in the customers best interest.  We would definitely refer them to family and friends.  Vieux Coulee5301sv ratedWalls are very thin and neighbors can be heard easily.  The floor is unlevel and creeks.  No vent in master bathroom, which is VERY hot most of the year.  (Difficult to apply makeup when you're sweating!)  Sidewalks and parking lot stay dirty/muddy from run off.
