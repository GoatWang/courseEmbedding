Akorn, Inc. Signs Supply Agreement With Fresenius Kabi For Premix Product


Akorn, Inc. recently announced that it has signed a five-year supply agreement with Fresenius Kabi for a novel premix product. Premix medications are ready to use intravenous drug products, which eliminate compounding steps in the pharmacy or at the point of care.

Under the terms of the agreement, Akorn will be responsible for development, marketing and distribution of the premix product. Fresenius Kabi will manufacture the product at its intravenous solutions manufacturing facility in Halden, Norway. The product is expected to launch in 2012. Current product sales of this product in the U.S. are in excess of $500M. Akorn will own the ANDA. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Arthur S. Przybyl, Akorn's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We look forward to partnering with Fresenius Kabi on this novel premix product. Additional niche products will be added that provide unique market value and fulfill customer needs."
Previously, this product was to be supplied by another manufacturer. Recently, they communicated their intention to discontinue contract manufacturing operations and have provided a settlement fee to Akorn for termination of the Agreement.
About Akorn, Inc.
Akorn, Inc. manufactures and markets sterile specialty pharmaceuticals. Akorn has manufacturing facilities located in Decatur, Illinois and Somerset, New Jersey and markets and distributes an extensive line of hospital and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.
Additional information is available at the Company's website at www.akorn.com.

You may have a patio and a strip of green if you live in an urban setting, or you may have a large yard with plenty of green space that allows you, your family and your friends to spread out. Patio furniture is a good place to start when outfitting your outdoor space. Those who have a large patio can choose sofas, chairs and outdoor dining sets. No exterior space is complete without a grill, and an outdoor kitchen is especially family- and entertaining-friendly. At Walmart, we offer many different pieces of outdoor furniture from which you can choose. Check out our Best Sellers, Special Buys and Clearance items for great finds on pieces to make your patio and backyard a place to which you'll rush home.Patio FurniturePatio furniture takes many forms. Some of the most common pieces are chaise lounges and chairs. Materials that this furniture is made of include aluminum, metal, wood and PVC. Some chairs and chaise lounges have mesh seats and backs. For added comfort, look for chairs that have accessories like overhangs and cup holders and have their own padding attached. If your desired piece doesn't come with them, we have several pads you can attach to them. Chairs that are portable and break down so they fit into a carry bag easily make it easy for you to use them at home, at the beach or an outdoor concert. If you entertain often outside, we have two- and three-person benches for added seating, and some of these have storage underneath. To relax in style, consider chairs that are also rocking chairs or are Adirondack-style chairs that are a cross between a chair and chaise lounge. Outdoor dining sets that have tables that allow for a large umbrella to insert through provide shade when it's time to sit down to lunch or dinner. Other types of outdoor furniture sets we have include conversation sets, bistro sets, sectionals and sofas. Many of the permanent pieces also have covers to protect them from inclement weather.Grills and Outdoor CookingA backyard doesn t seem complete without a grill or two in use. Having a grill as part of your patio setup means less time inside the house on nice days and a chance to show off your culinary skills   even if it's just for grilling hot dogs and hamburgers. Grills come in many assorted styles, and we have several for you to consider. Gas grills and charcoal grills are the most common, with electric grills also being an option. There are also portable grills that you can use on a table or when you're out at the beach or park, and smokers or pellet grills make it so you can slow-roast meats and vegetables and add a lot of smoky flavor to them.Gas grills come in two forms: propane and natural gas. Propane gas grills require a canister of propane to be attached, but this allows these grills to be used anywhere in the backyard or even away from home. Natural gas grills require a hookup to the home and can only go as far as the gas line allows them. Charcoal grills use lighted charcoal briquettes to supply the heat. Gas grills allow you to control the flame better, but some people prefer the taste that comes from cooking over charcoal.Portable grills can be either propane gas or charcoal. Smokers can also be all three, although many use chunks of hardwood like pecan or mesquite to create the smoke that permeates whatever you're cooking. Pellet grills are also smoker grills but use pellets made from sawdust to create smoke. With any kind of grill, accessories are important. This includes spatulas, tongs, sauce brushes or mops, knives, grill brushes, forks and skewers. You can purchase these items separately or choose one of our convenient sets that have all the pieces you need inside. Other accessories and supplies to consider include:  Grill covers   for protecting your grill against the elements Chimney starters, charcoal, lighter fluid, wood chunks and chips   use with both charcoal grills and smokers Grill cleaning tools   stiff wire brushes that keep grill grates clean of burnt food turkey fryers   large, deep fryers for frying large cuts of meat outside Refrigerators and ice makers   for keeping food and beverages coldPatio and Outdoor DecorHaving some furniture and a grill on the patio is a terrific start. However, you may want to consider adding some homier touches to complete the scene. A couple of planters or large pots with flowers is a nice touch, or if you're doing a lot of cooking outside, you may want to grow some fresh herbs. Outdoor lighting is also essential because you don't want to be forced to go inside once the sun sets. Options you have here include landscape and deck lights, decorative lights that you connect to your home, tiki torches, colored bulbs on strands that you hang strategically around the patio or even flood lights. Other decorations you can add to brighten your patio area and backyard include bird baths, bird feeders, fountains, garden statues, weathervanes and even a small pond. The choices come to life with your imagination, so see what we have to offer and what inspires you.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863629, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Both your lawn and the plants and vegetation you have need plenty of water and sunlight, which you and Mother Nature provide. However, your greenery needs a little help in the form of food, fertilizer, pest control and other treatments to keep everything growing and producing as much as it can. With our low prices, every day, on everything in our Garden Center, you can create a terrific-looking natural space for yourself, your family and your friends without breaking the bank.Lawn careIn addition to frequent cutting, edging, trimming and other maintenance steps you do to maintain a healthy, beautiful-looking lawn, you need to keep it fed and pest- and weed-free. If you have bare patches in your lawn, spread some grass seed in the bare spots. It'll take just a few weeks for the new grass to fill in. Make sure you're using seed that matches the type of grass you have, such as fescue or Bermuda grass.Keep your lawn fed properly by using fertilizer. Fertilizer comes in large bags from 10 pounds to 25 pounds and serves as the primary food for your lawn. It's recommended that you use a fertilizer spreader to apply fertilizer in an even pattern. Too much fertilizer in one spot can cause your grass to "burn" in direct sunlight. Choose a spreader that's suited for your lawn. If you have an average- to large-size lawn to maintain, you'll want to use a spreader that you push across your lawn that spreads the fertilizer out as you walk. If you only have a small patch of grass to maintain, such as at a condominium or apartment with a back yard, choose either a handheld spreader or apply with a wand using liquid fertilizer. There are even liquid fertilizers you can spray using your own water hose. GardeningEven before you plant your first flower bulb, vegetable, bush or tree, it's important to prepare the soil. The first step is to clear any weeds and old vegetation from the area where you plan to do your planting. Then, it's a good idea to enrich the soil with new garden soil or topsoil. It's also smart to use a pH level tester on the soil to make sure the pH levels are correct for the plants you wish to grow. It might be necessary to add some lime or calcium to the soil until the nutrient balance is correct.Once you've sown your seeds or planted your plants, it's necessary to keep them feed. If you apply garden soil initially, many brands have fertilizer mixed in with the soil, which feeds your plants for a few weeks. However, as the plants and flowers mature, it becomes necessary to feed them periodically. A good way to take care of this is to attach a liquid fertilizer container to a water hose to disperse a measured amount of food to your plants.If you don t have a patch of land to grow plants, there are many other options available, such as planters, vases and boxes. If you don t have access to a water hose, a watering can will deliver the water the plants need.Weed and plant controlIf you have weeds popping up in your lawn or garden, you want to remove them right away so they don't overrun your lawn, vegetables or other plants. In your garden, it's best to remove them by hand, such as by using a garden shovel, trowel or asparagus knife to dig beneath the roots of the weed and remove it completely. Any weeds that have roots remaining in the soil can regrow in time, which means you'll need to repeat the process again. For lawns, you can apply fertilizer to your grass that has weed killer mixed in, allowing you to "weed and feed" your lawn that the same time. For weeds that pop up individually on your lawn, such as dandelions or crabgrass, and for any weeds that grow between patio or sidewalk sections, you can use a spot sprayer to kill them directly. These usually kill the weeds within a few days.If you have garden pests, such as ants or crawling insects, that are eating or killing your plants, there are options you can use to kill the pests without harming your vegetation. A good example of this is diatomaceous earth, which provides long-lasting control against harmful insects. It's safe for pets, and you can even use it inside your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349566, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
