 Educational Background



Bachelor of Business Administration Degree 


University of Oklahoma

                  Attracting top students from across the nation and more than 100 countries around the world, OU provides a major university experience in a private college atmosphere. OU is number one in the nation in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled among public universities and is in the top ten of public universities in the nation in the graduation of Rhodes Scholars. The OU Honors College is one of the largest honors programs among public universities in the United States, matching the University’s best and brightest students with faculty in classrooms of 19 or fewer students. OU is one of the few public universities in the nation to cap the class size of first-year English composition courses at no more than 19. OU offers students the opportunity to study abroad in over 100 cities and 50 countries, including our signature program in Arezzo, Italy. The number of endowed faculty professorships and chaired positions has increased from less than 100 15 years ago to more than 560 today. This enables OU to keep and attract faculty researchers of national and international stature. 

 
For four of the last six years the OU Debate team has won the National Debate Championship. Other students from across campus have worked in teams to also win top awards in the National Petroleum Engineering Competition, the National Kennedy Center Competition in Drama, and the entrepreneurship program consistently ranks in the top five nationally.

 
OU has emerged as a pacesetter for public higher education in the United States and is ranked by The Princeton Review among the top 10 public universities in the nation in terms of academic excellence and cost for students. OU has more than doubled the amount of private scholarships in five years and raised its scholarship goal to $250 million. In addition, OU’s private endowment has increased more than five-fold since 1994, growing from $204 million to more than $1.8 billion. 

 
There is a true sense of family on the OU campus. Serving as a model for other public universities, OU established the Faculty-In-Residence program which places faculty members and their families in each of our residence halls to foster faculty and student interaction and encourage intergenerational friendships. Further, a different professor adopts each floor of the residence halls as well as each fraternity and sorority, allowing students and faculty to build relationships outside of the classroom. 

 
OU’s Fred Jones Museum of Art ranks in the top 5 university art museums in the United States. It received the Weitzenhoffer Collection, the largest gift of French Impressionist art ever given to a public university in the US. The Sam Noble Museum of Natural History is the largest university based museum of its kind in the world. OU’s Bizzell Memorial Library features one of the three largest history of science collections in the world, and is the only place in the United States where you can hold a book with Galileo's handwriting in your own hands.                




Executive MBA 


Southern Methodist University - Cox School of Business

                  Since 1920, the SMU Cox School of Business has equipped students with the skills, knowledge and experience they need to succeed in business. Major publications—including BusinessWeek, The Economist, Financial Times, Forbes, U.S. News & World Report and The Wall Street Journal—rank SMU Cox among the top business schools in the nation and around the world. The Cox School offers a full range of undergraduate and graduate degree programs, as well as innovative executive education programs encompassing all aspects of business leadership and management.

Write data mask method and system



Patent number:  8412912
                                            

Abstract:  In various embodiments, dedicated mask pins are eliminated by sending a data mask on address lines of the interface. A memory controller receives a request for a memory write operation from a memory client and determines the granularity of the write data from a write data mask sent by the client. Granularity, as used herein, indicates a quantity of write data to which each bit of the received write data mask applies. In an embodiment, the memory controller generates a particular write command and a particular write data mask based on the granularity of the write data. The write command generated is typically the most efficient of several write commands available, but embodiments are not so limited. The write command is transmitted on command lines of the interface, and the write data mask is transmitted on address lines of the interface.

Miss-under-miss processing and cache flushing



Patent number:  8037281
                                            

Abstract:  Described herein are systems and methods that reduce the latency which may occur when a level one (L1) cache issues a request to a level two (L2) cache, and that ensure that a translation requests sent to an L2 cache are flushed during a context switch. Such a system may include a work queue and a cache (such as an L2 cache). The work queue comprises a plurality of state machines, each configured to store a request for access to memory. The state machines can monitor requests that are stored in the other state machines and requests that the other state machines issue to the cache. A state machine only sends its request to the cache if another state machine is not already awaiting translation data relating to the that request. In this way, the request/translation traffic between the work queue and the cache can be significantly reduced.

Memory Controller With Ring Bus for Interconnecting Memory Clients to Memory Devices



Publication number:  20110093644
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of a distributed memory controller system implemented on a single integrated circuit device are described. In one embodiment, a memory controller that provides an interconnection circuit between a first plurality of memory devices to a second plurality of memory clients includes a ring bus to route at least one of the memory request and data return signals between the memory clients and the memory devices. The ring bus is configured in a ring topography that is distributed across a portion of an integrated circuit device, resulting in a reduction in the maximum wiring density at the center of memory controller. The ring bus structure also reduces the overall number of interconnections as well as the number of storage elements, thus reducing the total area used by the memory controller.

Memory controller with ring bus for interconnecting memory clients to memory devices



Publication number:  20080016254
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of a distributed memory controller system implemented on a single integrated circuit device are described. In one embodiment, a memory controller that provides an interconnection circuit between a first plurality of memory devices to a second plurality of memory clients includes a ring bus to route at least one of the memory request and data return signals between the memory clients and the memory devices. The ring bus is configured in a ring topography that is distributed across a portion of an integrated circuit device, resulting in a reduction in the maximum wiring density at the center of memory controller. The ring bus structure also reduces the overall number of interconnections as well as the number of storage elements, thus reducing the total area used by the memory controller.
