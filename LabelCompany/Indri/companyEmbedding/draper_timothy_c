Background and early life[edit]
Draper is the third in a line of venture capitalists. He is the son of Phyllis (Culbertson) and William Henry Draper III and the younger brother of actress Polly Draper. His father is the founder of Draper & Johnson Investment Company and former chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. His grandfather, William Henry Draper Jr., founded Draper, Gaither and Anderson in 1958.[3]
He has a degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University,[5] and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1984.[3]
Financial career[edit]
In 1985, Draper left the bank Alex, Brown & Sons to start his own venture capital firm; former officemate John H.N. Fisher became a partner in 1991, and business student Steve Jurvetson became the third partner in the firm.[6]
In 2013 he announced his departure from Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[7]
Hotmail and viral marketing[edit]
Although the history of the term is not fully clear, it is commonly argued that Draper and Jurvetson "invented viral marketing" in 1996, due to their idea of automatically attaching a brief advertising message to the bottom of outgoing Hotmail emails,[8] though the neologism itself is documented as early as a 1989 edition of PC User.[9]
Skype[edit]
Draper's father, Bill Draper, was an earlier investor in Skype, and DFJ backed Skype in 2004.[10][11] The company owned 10% of Skype in 2005 when it was sold to eBay for US$4.1 billion.[12]
Bitcoin auction[edit]
On June 27, 2014, Draper purchased, for an undisclosed price, nearly 30,000 bitcoins which had been seized by the US Marshals service and auctioned to the public.[13] The accumulation of bitcoins was estimated to be worth US$19 million at the time.[14][15]
On January 27, 2015, Tim Draper wagered about $400,000 (which is 2000 bitcoins with $200 price) that the bitcoin will rebound from its recent plunge.[16]
Politics[edit]
Draper has spoken out against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, stating that they limit the viability of taking companies public.[17]
In 2000, Draper spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers.[18]
Six Californias[edit]
In early 2014, Draper filed a petition which was accepted by California's Secretary of State Debra Bowen to begin collecting signatures to divide California into six smaller states, arguing that California is "increasingly ungovernable" as one state.[19] However, on September 12, 2014, it was announced the plan fell short of the required amount of valid signatures to land it on the 2016 ballot.[20] Draper spent in excess of $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 just for political consultants.[21]
Educational program[edit]
In 2013, Draper launched Draper University of Heroes, an educational program that offers a crash course in entrepreneurship. The university's residential program is based in San Mateo, California, and the curriculum is designed by Draper.[22]

In 1985, Draper left the bank Alex, Brown & Sons to start his own venture capital firm; former officemate John H.N. Fisher became a partner in 1991, and business student Steve Jurvetson became the third partner in the firm.[6]
In 2013 he announced his departure from Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[7]
Hotmail and viral marketing[edit]
Although the history of the term is not fully clear, it is commonly argued that Draper and Jurvetson "invented viral marketing" in 1996, due to their idea of automatically attaching a brief advertising message to the bottom of outgoing Hotmail emails,[8] though the neologism itself is documented as early as a 1989 edition of PC User.[9]
Skype[edit]
Draper's father, Bill Draper, was an earlier investor in Skype, and DFJ backed Skype in 2004.[10][11] The company owned 10% of Skype in 2005 when it was sold to eBay for US$4.1 billion.[12]
Bitcoin auction[edit]
On June 27, 2014, Draper purchased, for an undisclosed price, nearly 30,000 bitcoins which had been seized by the US Marshals service and auctioned to the public.[13] The accumulation of bitcoins was estimated to be worth US$19 million at the time.[14][15]
On January 27, 2015, Tim Draper wagered about $400,000 (which is 2000 bitcoins with $200 price) that the bitcoin will rebound from its recent plunge.[16]
Politics[edit]
Draper has spoken out against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, stating that they limit the viability of taking companies public.[17]
In 2000, Draper spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers.[18]
Six Californias[edit]
In early 2014, Draper filed a petition which was accepted by California's Secretary of State Debra Bowen to begin collecting signatures to divide California into six smaller states, arguing that California is "increasingly ungovernable" as one state.[19] However, on September 12, 2014, it was announced the plan fell short of the required amount of valid signatures to land it on the 2016 ballot.[20] Draper spent in excess of $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 just for political consultants.[21]
Educational program[edit]
In 2013, Draper launched Draper University of Heroes, an educational program that offers a crash course in entrepreneurship. The university's residential program is based in San Mateo, California, and the curriculum is designed by Draper.[22]

Timothy C. Draper is the founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and a donor to California ballot proposition campaigns.
Draper is said to be the creator of online viral marketing.[1] His idea to use "viral marketing" in web-based e-mail to geometrically spread an Internet product to its market was instrumental to the successes of "Hotmail" and "Yahoo! Mail," and has been adopted as a standard marketing technique of hundreds of businesses. Draper coined the use of the term "viral marketing" in connection with Internet services.
Draper invested in and contributed to the development of Skype, Baidu, Overture, and Hotmail.
Draper's official biography describes him as "an advocate for entrepreneurs and free markets." He is an alumni of Harvard and won the Commmonwealth Club's Distinguished Citizen Award for achievements in green and sustainable energy. He is the chairman of BizWorld, which teaches entrepreneurship and business to children. He serves on the Harvard Business School Board of Dean's Advisors.[2] He started a school in San Mateo, the Draper University of Heroes, that is geared toward people who want to learn how to lead tech startups.[3]

In December 2013, Draper filed language for the "Six Californias" Initiative. This initiative, if it qualifies for the ballot and is approved by the state's voters, will call on the United States Congress to officially divide California into six separate states.[4]

What They Say About Us "The wonderful thing about entrepreneurs is that their passion for starting new companies transcends languages and geographic boundaries." Ron Conway,  Founder and Managing Partner of the Angel Investors LP funds, early stage investor in Google and PayPal "Networking is very important for start-ups. The challenge for them is often not money: it is mentoring and finding people who can give good advice from experience." Esther Dyson,  Founder, EDventure Holdings "This conference is clearly a labor of love for a group of dedicated professionals who care deeply about the Eastern European entrepreneurs. From the value-packed educational panels, to the star-studded key note speakers' line up, to an amazing quantity of venture capitalists – this is a not to be missed event for any high tech entrepreneur," Richard Guha,  President of the Marketing Executives Network and Managing Partner at MaxBrandEquity "As Stanford MBA students, we were exposed to a lot of VC firms both from the Valley and abroad. It is at Stanford that we met Anna Dvornikova, an absolutely amazing business leader and (by our big luck) our friend, who was the center of the Russian Silicon Valley professional community, and was doing a huge work to connect Russia and the Valley. Anna helped us a lot with kick-starting Wikimart, put us to our first-ever conference, introduced us to most of Russian VCs. And all that happened in a very short time span! It was the beginning of a six-month journey that despite the particularly tough times resulted in an extraordinarily group of investors backing our start-up." Maxim Faldin and Kamil Kurmakayev,co-CEOs, Wikimart

Timothy Cook "Tim" Draper (born June 11, 1958) is an American venture capital investor, and 1985 founder of the firm that would become Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ).[3] Draper is also the founder of Draper Associates and Draper University. In July 2014, Draper received wide coverage[4] for his purchase at a US Marshals Service auction of seized bitcoins from the Silk Road marketplace website.

Background and early life[edit]
Draper is the third in a line of venture capitalists. He is the son of Phyllis (Culbertson) and William Henry Draper III and the younger brother of actress Polly Draper. His father is the founder of Draper & Johnson Investment Company and former chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. His grandfather, William Henry Draper Jr., founded Draper, Gaither and Anderson in 1958.[3]
He has a degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University,[5] and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1984.[3]
Financial career[edit]
In 1985, Draper left the bank Alex, Brown & Sons to start his own venture capital firm; former officemate John H.N. Fisher became a partner in 1991, and business student Steve Jurvetson became the third partner in the firm.[6]
In 2013 he announced his departure from Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[7]
Hotmail and viral marketing[edit]
Although the history of the term is not fully clear, it is commonly argued that Draper and Jurvetson "invented viral marketing" in 1996, due to their idea of automatically attaching a brief advertising message to the bottom of outgoing Hotmail emails,[8] though the neologism itself is documented as early as a 1989 edition of PC User.[9]
Skype[edit]
Draper's father, Bill Draper, was an earlier investor in Skype, and DFJ backed Skype in 2004.[10][11] The company owned 10% of Skype in 2005 when it was sold to eBay for US$4.1 billion.[12]
Bitcoin auction[edit]
On June 27, 2014, Draper purchased, for an undisclosed price, nearly 30,000 bitcoins which had been seized by the US Marshals service and auctioned to the public.[13] The accumulation of bitcoins was estimated to be worth US$19 million at the time.[14][15]
On January 27, 2015, Tim Draper wagered about $400,000 (which is 2000 bitcoins with $200 price) that the bitcoin will rebound from its recent plunge.[16]
Politics[edit]
Draper has spoken out against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, stating that they limit the viability of taking companies public.[17]
In 2000, Draper spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers.[18]
Six Californias[edit]
In early 2014, Draper filed a petition which was accepted by California's Secretary of State Debra Bowen to begin collecting signatures to divide California into six smaller states, arguing that California is "increasingly ungovernable" as one state.[19] However, on September 12, 2014, it was announced the plan fell short of the required amount of valid signatures to land it on the 2016 ballot.[20] Draper spent in excess of $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 just for political consultants.[21]
Educational program[edit]
In 2013, Draper launched Draper University of Heroes, an educational program that offers a crash course in entrepreneurship. The university's residential program is based in San Mateo, California, and the curriculum is designed by Draper.[22]

Background and early life[edit]
Draper is the third in a line of venture capitalists. He is the son of Phyllis (Culbertson) and William Henry Draper III and the younger brother of actress Polly Draper. His father is the founder of Draper & Johnson Investment Company and former chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. His grandfather, William Henry Draper Jr., founded Draper, Gaither and Anderson in 1958.[3]
He has a degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University,[5] and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1984.[3]
Financial career[edit]
In 1985, Draper left the bank Alex, Brown & Sons to start his own venture capital firm; former officemate John H.N. Fisher became a partner in 1991, and business student Steve Jurvetson became the third partner in the firm.[6]
In 2013 he announced his departure from Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[7]
Hotmail and viral marketing[edit]
Although the history of the term is not fully clear, it is commonly argued that Draper and Jurvetson "invented viral marketing" in 1996, due to their idea of automatically attaching a brief advertising message to the bottom of outgoing Hotmail emails,[8] though the neologism itself is documented as early as a 1989 edition of PC User.[9]
Skype[edit]
Draper's father, Bill Draper, was an earlier investor in Skype, and DFJ backed Skype in 2004.[10][11] The company owned 10% of Skype in 2005 when it was sold to eBay for US$4.1 billion.[12]
Bitcoin auction[edit]
On June 27, 2014, Draper purchased, for an undisclosed price, nearly 30,000 bitcoins which had been seized by the US Marshals service and auctioned to the public.[13] The accumulation of bitcoins was estimated to be worth US$19 million at the time.[14][15]
On January 27, 2015, Tim Draper wagered about $400,000 (which is 2000 bitcoins with $200 price) that the bitcoin will rebound from its recent plunge.[16]
Politics[edit]
Draper has spoken out against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, stating that they limit the viability of taking companies public.[17]
In 2000, Draper spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers.[18]
Six Californias[edit]
In early 2014, Draper filed a petition which was accepted by California's Secretary of State Debra Bowen to begin collecting signatures to divide California into six smaller states, arguing that California is "increasingly ungovernable" as one state.[19] However, on September 12, 2014, it was announced the plan fell short of the required amount of valid signatures to land it on the 2016 ballot.[20] Draper spent in excess of $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 just for political consultants.[21]
Educational program[edit]
In 2013, Draper launched Draper University of Heroes, an educational program that offers a crash course in entrepreneurship. The university's residential program is based in San Mateo, California, and the curriculum is designed by Draper.[22]

  								Tim Draper is the founding partner of Draper Associates and DFJ. Tim’s original suggestion to use viral marketing as a method for spreading a software application from customer to customer was instrumental to the successes of Hotmail, Skype, and others. 

Tim has been recognized as a leading supporter of entrepreneurship with numerous awards and honors. He was listed as #46 of the most outstanding Harvard alumni, #7 on the Forbes Midas List, #1 of the Most Networked Venture Capitalists by Always On, and #98 in Worth Magazine’s 100 Most Powerful People in Finance. Tim also received the World Entrepreneurship Forum’s “Entrepreneur for the World” in 2015. 

Tim received a BS from Stanford University with a major in electrical engineering and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.

He served on the California State Board of Education in 1998-1999, and currently leads an initiative to create six new states in California (Six Californias) to encourage competition and choice in government.

In 1994, he created a non-profit for young children to learn about business and entrepreneurship called BizWorld. In 2011, he created Draper University of Heroes, a residential and online school to help extraordinary young people meet their entrepreneurial goals.

On June 27, 2014, Draper purchased, for an undisclosed price, nearly 30,000 bitcoins which had been seized by the US Marshals service and auctioned to the public.[13] The accumulation of bitcoins was estimated to be worth US$19 million at the time.[14][15]
On January 27, 2015, Tim Draper wagered about $400,000 (which is 2000 bitcoins with $200 price) that the bitcoin will rebound from its recent plunge.[16]
Politics[edit]
Draper has spoken out against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, stating that they limit the viability of taking companies public.[17]
In 2000, Draper spent $20 million on a failed measure to support school vouchers.[18]
Six Californias[edit]
In early 2014, Draper filed a petition which was accepted by California's Secretary of State Debra Bowen to begin collecting signatures to divide California into six smaller states, arguing that California is "increasingly ungovernable" as one state.[19] However, on September 12, 2014, it was announced the plan fell short of the required amount of valid signatures to land it on the 2016 ballot.[20] Draper spent in excess of $5 million to try to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 just for political consultants.[21]
Educational program[edit]
In 2013, Draper launched Draper University of Heroes, an educational program that offers a crash course in entrepreneurship. The university's residential program is based in San Mateo, California, and the curriculum is designed by Draper.[22]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
