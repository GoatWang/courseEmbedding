He is Chair of the Compensation Committee and a member of the Finance Committee. Mr. Bryant's years of experience as an executive at a large global company, including in the roles of Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, provide to the Company's Board operational, strategic planning and financial expertise and considerable business acumen, as well as international business experience. We believe the Company benefits from his Board leadership perspective garnered from serving as both Vice Chairman and Chairman of Intel's Board. Mr. Bryant also has other public company board experience with service on audit and governance committees.
