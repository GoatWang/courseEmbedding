Bow River Capital Real Estate Fund I, LP Completes First Investment

January 13, 2016



Bow River Capital is pleased to announce the acquisition of Songbird Properties, LLC (“Songbird”) by Bow River Capital Real Estate Fund I, LP (the “Fund”). Songbird is a residential portfolio of 45 rented single-family homes, townhomes, and condominiums located in Arapahoe, Douglas, and Jefferson counties (Colorado). This part of Metro Denver offers a high quality of life at a comparatively lower cost of living than is available in Denver County.
The acquisition opportunity was sourced through a direct relationship maintained by Bow River principals. Bow River Capital’s knowledge of the residential real estate market and ability to move efficiently provided the framework for a successful and timely close. First National Bank of Denver, a division of First National Bank of Santa Fe, provided the debt financing.
Bow River Capital Real Estate Fund I, LP makes opportunistic investments in industrial, office, retail, residential, mixed use, and land targeting asset values of $10 million – $30 million. The Fund focuses on assets in Bow River Capital’s Rodeo RegionTM, which includes U.S. and Canadian markets in Colorado, Texas, Arizona, Utah, Oklahoma, and Alberta, Canada amongst others.
