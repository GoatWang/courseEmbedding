Chase Corporation Announces First Quarter Results | Revenues of $55.9 Million | Earnings Per Share of $0.74
Bridgewater, MA – January 6, 2015 – Chase Corporation (NYSE MKT: CCF) today reported revenues of 
          $55.9 million for the quarter ended November 30, 2014. This represents an increase of $1.7 million compared to $54.2 million in the same quarter of last fiscal year. Net income attributable to Chase Corporation of $7.0 million in the current quarter decreased $1.8 million from $8.8 million in the prior year period. Earnings per diluted share of $0.74 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 represented a decrease of $0.20 compared to $0.94 per share in fiscal 2014. Included in the prior year fiscal quarter results was a gain, net of tax, totaling $3.7 million or $0.40 per share, relating to the sale of the Company’s Insulfab product line in October 2013, which was not repeated in the current quarter.
Peter R. Chase, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented,
"We had a solid start to the 2015 fiscal year with momentum carrying over from the end of last year. When we subtract from the fiscal 2014 numbers the one-time pre-tax gain on the sale of a product line of $5.7 million in October 2013, income increased substantially in the quarter ending November 30, 2014. The quality of the revenue also improved with Operating income up 29% over the previous first quarter. This speaks to the continued effort to reduce fixed manufacturing overhead through ongoing facilities consolidation, stable raw material costs and a focus on the marketing of higher margin products.
Adam P. Chase, President and Chief Operating Officer, added,
"In the Industrial Materials segment, HumiSeal coatings and cover tapes for the electronic industry had demand increases led by automotive applications. Pulling and detection tapes were also strong with renewed infrastructure work to support bandwidth expansion. Wire & cable products were steady and sales of durable paper products were weaker in the quarter.
"The Construction Materials segment is having success with pipeline coatings for water infrastructure projects in the Middle East while gas and oil pipeline product demand in the U.S. has slowed. Municipal infrastructure coatings in architectural and building envelope applications showed positive growth. Bridge & highway product sales have been down for the last nine months due to project postponements and cancellations stemming from the severe winter weather a year ago.
Peter R. Chase also commented,
"As mentioned above there was a significant gain last year from the sale of the Insulfab product line which prompted us to pay an additional $0.10 per share dividend. In order to measure and compare results from continuing operations we use Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). For each period ending November 30, the calculation is $13,548 for 2014, $10,739 for 2013 and $9,363 for 2012, indicating an average annual 2-year growth rate (AAGR) of 20%. This shows the steady progress for which we are aiming.
"We are pleased with the progress of our M&A program in developing candidates. This market is very active and valuations are higher than in recent times, so sticking to our model is more difficult. Our ERP system is now fully deployed across all our entities and was completed on schedule. This was a substantial effort and implemented almost entirely by internal staff.
"As we move ahead we see both challenges and opportunities with the volatility in crude oil prices. Our next quarter is traditionally our lowest performer due to loss of construction projects in the winter months but we will work hard to maximize results. I am looking forward to my role in the new leadership structure and continuing to help the company grow."
The following table summarizes the Company’s financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2014 and 2013.

As of November 30, 2014, the Company’s working capital was $89.7 million, including cash on hand of $53.1 million and a current ratio of 3.5. The outstanding balance of the Company’s term debt is $57.1 million. The Company’s $15.0 million line of credit is fully available.
