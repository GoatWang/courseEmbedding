ESTERO, Fla., Nov. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:   HTZ) has announced that its Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation (HERC) business has recently added two new members to its senior leadership team as the business continues with plans to become an independent company by mid-2016.
Barbara Brasier has joined HERC as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective November 9, 2015.  Brasier will oversee HERC's global Finance function, including accounting, analysis, audit services, budgeting, control, planning, tax, treasury and reporting.  In addition, Brasier will play a lead role in positioning HERC in the capital markets and developing relationships with banks, ratings agencies, institutional investors and financial analysts.
Brasier joins HERC with 35 years of experience in finance and a career that has spanned diverse roles across public accounting, paper-goods, machinery and industrial-equipment and food-manufacturing industries.  Most recently, Brasier was Senior Vice President, Tax and Treasury, for Mondelez International, Inc., a $30+ billion food company comprising the global snacking and food brands that were spun off from the former Kraft Foods Inc.  
Maryann Waryjas has joined HERC as Senior Vice President and General Counsel, effective November 11, 2015.   Waryjas will lead all aspects of HERC's global Legal function, including contractual- and transaction-related legal activities and regulatory and litigation matters.  In addition, Waryjas will oversee HERC's corporate governance and statutory reporting requirements leading up to and after HERC becoming a standalone public company.
Waryjas joins HERC with more than 30 years of experience in the legal profession, including as an attorney and partner with prominent national law firms.  She has extensive experience representing businesses in the construction, manufacturing, technology, infrastructure, maritime, financial services, global distribution, consumer products, defense and energy industries.  Most recently, Waryjas was Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, a leading provider of dredging and marine engineering services.  
"I am thrilled to welcome Barb and Maryann to HERC," said Larry H. Silber, President and Chief Executive Officer, HERC.  "Their diverse and relevant career experience, extraordinary subject matter expertise and demonstrated business acumen greatly strengthen our leadership team.  With Barb and Maryann on board, HERC now has a full C-level team with substantial managerial and governance experience to execute its growth plan and remains on track for its mid-2016 separation from Hertz Global Holdings.  
"Just as important to building our C-suite team, over the past five months we have added considerable depth and breadth to our senior management team with approximately 20 highly experienced and industry-knowledgeable staff joining HERC in field operations, sales, IT, finance and other business-critical roles.  Also, we have engaged Huron Consulting Group, a leading provider of business consulting services, to partner with our Program Management Office to help keep us oriented toward a successful separation and for our long-term future as a standalone company."
