Mettrum Announces Strategic Acquisition to Further Accelerate Growth and Research Profile
Mettrum acquires Apollo Applied Research with growing base of 5,400 active clients
TORONTO, ONTARIO–(Marketwired – Nov. 16, 2016) – Mettrum Health Corp. (“Mettrum” or the “Company”) (TSX VENTURE:MT), a vertically integrated health and wellness company focused on research, development, production and distribution of cannabis products, is pleased to announce that it has acquired 100% of the shares (the “Acquisition”) of Apollo Applied Research Inc. (“Apollo”).
Under the terms of the Acquisition, Mettrum paid $1 million in cash and issued 522,684 shares from treasury at closing. These shares will be subject to a four-month hold and the Company is required to inform the TSX Venture Exchange of this transaction. In addition, the Company will issue additional shares, over the next 5 years based on Apollo achieving certain operational metrics. Apollo will operate independently as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mettrum. Based on Mettrum’s evaluation of Apollo’s historical performance and future growth prospects, the Acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Mettrum. Apollo generates revenue from OHIP as well as other provincial health insurance plans, research grants and private insurance payments which are secured on behalf of its patients.
Apollo Applied Research has a proven track record of growth in active patients, revenue and research. Apollo is dedicated to identifying the most effect strains of medical cannabis for patients suffering with chronic pain as well as many other medical conditions. Apollo offers an evidence based approach to treating patients with medical cannabis by running two of Canada’s largest medical cannabis studies. Apollo’s continuing research helps better evaluate the benefits of medical cannabis and allows Apollo to discover and better understand the most effective strains for each condition.
Apollo has been conducting clinical research on chronic pain since 2014 and in March of 2016 Apollo launched its newest study analyzing the effects of medical cannabis on patients with PTSD.
Apollo’s research has been published in multiple medical journals and is regularly called upon to present at medical seminars and conferences including the Clinical Research Association of Canada. Apollo’s strong emphasis on research sets the company apart and is consistent with Mettrum’s commitment to advancing the understanding of cannabis in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions.
Apollo facilitates access to medical cannabis by putting patients together with qualified health care professionals. The Apollo staff are dedicated professionals who specialize in training, support, education and advocacy for qualified patients for whom cannabis may be used medically.

Michael Haines, Chief Executive Officer of Mettrum
Bryan Hendin, Apollos’s Founder and President, will continue to run the company, and I would like to welcome the Apollo team to the Mettrum group of companies. We are all very excited and look forward to working together while realizing synergies and creating value for all stakeholders.
“We are extremely excited to be joining the great team at Mettrum and working together to accelerate growth across the board. Apollo has been researching strains of medical cannabis for several years and our new collaboration with Mettrum will allow us to work together to offer patients the most effect cannabis products” said Bryan Hendin. “I am very impressed with the focus which Mettrum brings to quality assurance and how effective this is in dealing with the demands of patients.”

What are they thinking? Apollo's acquisition of Digital First Media





 Share on Facebook
 Share on Twitter


Apollo Global Management has almost won its two-horse race with Cerberus Capital Management to acquire Digital First Media’s 75 daily newspapers and more than 100 non-dailies, or as DFM likes to put it “800 multi-platform products reach 64 million Americans each month across 14 states.”
The two private equity companies emerged in January as the only two likely bidders for the whole company, as I reported then in Capital (“Cerberus, Apollo bidding for Digital First Media”) and reaffirmed in February, as Apollo moved ahead by at least a nose (“Ken Doctor’s Media Notebook: Digital First Media sale nears end.”).Story Continued Below






 Apollo, by far the bigger of two firms, with $164 billion assets under management, compared to Cerberus’ $25 billion, is now finalizing its acquisition and its financing, or as Reuters put it Monday, “in advanced talks.” I’ve confirmed, through confidential sources, that Apollo is indeed closer to getting the deal done and that the purchase price would come around $400 million. An announcement may still come before the end of the quarter, or, if not, soon thereafter. The sale will set a larger stage, as newspapers as diverse as the New York Daily News and U-T San Diego test their value in the beleaguered newspaper property marketplace.
 The long sales process, decided upon by DFM’s owners more than a year ago, and finally made public last fall, fulfills DFM CEO John Paton’s goal of finding a single buyer for the company. That goal, met with much skepticism, including mine, means that DFM will move from control of one private equity owner, Alden Global Capital to another.
 Yet, 2015 offers quite differing digital transformation challenges than those faced by Alden and Paton as they consolidated ownership, control and management over the last five years. Consequently, Apollo’s answer to the question of what’s next for the much-cut and consolidated properties is the key one, and one, at this point, on which we know only bare outlines.
 Apollo believes it can bring new strategic thinking – straddling the worlds of print and digital better than most current newspaper owners -- to this deal. Those newspapers’ communities, readers, staffs and merchants await signals on the impact of that thinking.
 They’ll have to wait well into 2015 to hear the first clues. Expect a closing of the sale to take three to six months.
 If the purchase price finalizes at $400 million, that will work out to a multiple in the neighborhood of 3.75, as complicating pools of assets are sorted out. Both Gannett and Stephens Media have been partners of DFM and its predecessor companies, especially MediaNews Group. Those pooled assets, arising from partnerships in California, Pennsylvania and Texas, mean divided ownership stakes. Essentially, those two companies will cash out, one way or another, on the approximate $15 million of DFM’s annual EBITDA to which they can stake claims. That leaves approximately $105 million in EBITDA which Alden, a 40% owner, and its other partners, will be paid at an approximate 3.75 multiple.
 Is it a good deal? That’s a question for this transitioning digital age? As a multiple, it’s at the lower end of what Alden and Paton hoped to get.
 Print advertising declines in the high single digits – ones experienced by all papers of significant size -- made relentless mush of the argument that the DFM papers were turning a corner in their bids to become more profitably “digital-first.” “Digital-first,” of course, was Paton’s battle cry early on, as he first took over management of smaller, post-bankrupt Journal Register Company and then larger, post-bankrupt Media News, and then, after still another bankruptcy, merged the two into the official Digital First Media company in December, 2013.
 Those inside the company over the years both give the CEO credit for real change and for a talent for self-promotion that exceeded his real, lasting accomplishments. In the end, as Paton moves of out the CEO role, allowing him to enjoy his board seats at The Guardian, Prisa and El Pais, he takes pride in assembling a singular company that could be sold to a singular buyer at a price acceptable to his employers, largely Alden. Consider DFM, at least, a feat of financial engineering.
 The DFM that Apollo would inherit, though, is not a stellar business model for the U.S., or Western, newspaper-centric industry. While in some digital-forward areas it may have done better than its peers, in others, it has fared worse. Now Apollo -- and the execs it chooses to take over the management reins – must sort through the diverse parts of this odd assemblage of far-flung, metro paper and community paper company, a company I’ve likened more to an odd Dr. Seuss assemblage that a logical enterprise a smart capitalist would put together. Apollo executed deep due diligence, but will still face early decisions on where the bright management lights are to be found within the company and which of DFM’s centralizing technologies should be kept, and which replaced.
 Most importantly, Apollo faces translating its theory of acquisition into a turnaround strategy, the hallmark of the company. Apollo takes on a set of assets that has maintained profit margin by years of cutting, slicing of costs, staffing and, of course, product. For all of its digital-first positioning, the company’s mobile products stand out as laggards, for instance.
 Don’t expect Apollo to continue the process of just taking out costs to maintain near-term profit. Throughout due diligence, confidential sources confirm, the company, along with competitor Cerberus, has shown an increasingly keen understanding of the company’s – and larger industry’s – woes.
 Consequently, look for Apollo to take a longer-term view of investment expense and expected revenue return. Its time horizon likely runs five to seven years. Within that time frame, the world, including its readers and advertisers, migrates increasingly digital. Over time, that will mean less reliance on print, but it’s the pathway that will count.
 Apollo, as a private owner, could add to its own well-turned turnaround playbook. It could borrow as much from the strategies of Jeff Bezos, John Henry and Glen Taylor, as those deep-pocketed, private owners have opted to re-invest in their print and digital products at the Washington Post, Boston Globe and Minneapolis Star-Tribune respectively.
 It would be overly optimistic for DFM’s communities, readers and journalists from San Jose to Denver to El Paso to Saint Paul to Pontiac to New Haven to expect a revival of community journalism in their hometowns. At best, they may see targeted investments to shore up wobbly products and bring the inaptly named DFM more fully into the digital age. They could see days of printing cut, as Advance Publications has done. All options will be on the table, as the overriding goal of financial buyers is gamed: how to increase value toward an exit post 2020.

Apollo
Acquisition Corporation

(A
Development Stage Company)

  

NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2010

 

On
September 27, 2006, Apollo Acquisition Corporation (the "Company")
was formed in the Cayman Islands with the objective to acquire, or
merge with, an operating business. The Company's formation and
administrative costs of $2,592 were financed through the issuance
of 859,375 shares of ordinary shares at par value of $0.000128 per
share for consideration of $110 together with a payable to the
Founders of $2,482.

 

At
September 30, 2010, the Company had not yet commenced operations.
All activity from September 27, 2006 ("Date of Inception") through
September 30, 2010 relates to the Company's formation. The Company
selected June 30 as its fiscal year-end.

 

The
Company, based on its proposed business activities, is a "blank
check" company. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines such
a company as "a development stage company" as it either has no
specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its
business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an
unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person; and
has issued "penny stock," as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Many states have enacted statutes,
rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank
check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does
not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in
its securities, either debt or equity, until the Company concludes
a business combination with an operating entity.

 

The
Company was organized to acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly-held company
and, to a lesser extent, that desires to employ the Company's funds
in its business. The Company's principal business objective for the
next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth
potential through a business combination rather than short-term
earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate
target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location. The analysis of new business opportunities will be
undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and
directors of the Company.

 

NOTE 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Interim
financial information

 

The
financial statements included herein, which have not been audited
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion
of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results
of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for any other interim period or
for a full year. Certain information, accounting policies and
footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial
statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we
believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in
our Form 10 for the year ended June 30, 2010, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2010.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

These
financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United State of America, whereby revenues are
recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred. The
Company also follows the accounting guidelines for accounting for
and reporting in Development Stage Enterprise in preparing its
financial statements.

NOTE 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Continued)

 

Statement
of Cash Flows

 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly
liquid investments (i.e., investments which, when purchased, have
original maturities of three months or less) to be cash
equivalents.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Loss Per
Ordinary Share

 

Basic loss
per ordinary share is based on the weighted effect of ordinary
shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net
loss by the weighted average shares outstanding during the
period.  Diluted loss per ordinary share is calculated by
dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
used in the basic loss per share calculation plus the number of
ordinary shares that would be issued assuming exercise or
conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares
outstanding.  The Company does not present diluted
earnings per share for years in which it incurred net losses as the
effect is antidilutive.

 
 

At
September 30, 2010 and June 30, 2010, there were no potentially
dilutive ordinary shares outstanding.

 

On March
1, 2008, the Company consolidated the authorized ordinary share
capital of the Company from 50,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.0001
par value each to 39,062,500 ordinary shares of $0.000128 par value
each. This resulted in every shareholder as of March 1, 2008
receiving 0.78125 ordinary shares for every ordinary share
previously held.  This was treated as a stock split for
U.S. GAAP purposes, and all share and per share data is presented
as if the consolidation took place as of the date of inception,
September 27, 2006.  On March 1, 2008, the Company also
consolidated the authorized preference share capital of the Company
from 1,000,000 preference shares of $0.0001 par value each to
781,250 preference shares of $0.000128   par
value.

 

Income
Taxes

 

Apollo
Acquisition Corporation was registered as an Exempted Company in
the Cayman Islands, and therefore, is not subject to Cayman Island
income taxes for 20 years from the Date of
Inception.  While the Company has no intention of
conducting any business activities in the United States, the
Company would be subject to United States income taxes based on
such activities that would occur in the United States.

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method
whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse.  In assessing the realization of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is likely that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the Company attaining future taxable
income during periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.

NOTE 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Continued)

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

Our
financial instruments consist of accounts payable and payables to
an affiliate. We believe the fair value of our payables reflects
their carrying amounts.

 

In 2007,
the FASB issued new guidance relating to the measurement and
disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.  This
guidance established a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP
and clarified the definition of fair value within that framework.
This guidance does not require assets and liabilities that were
previously recorded at cost to be recorded at fair value or for
assets and liabilities that are already required to be disclosed at
fair value, This guidance introduced, or reiterated, a number of
key concepts which form the foundation of the fair value
measurement appro

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking
statements are not statements of historical facts, but rather
reflect our current expectations or beliefs concerning future
events and results. We generally use the words
“believes,” “expects,”
“intends,” “plans,”
“anticipates,” “likely,” “will”
and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements, including those concerning our
expectations, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, some
of which are beyond our control, which may cause our actual
results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be
materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause
our results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs
include, but are not limited to, those factors set forth in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 1A. - Risk
Factors” below, as well as the following:

 

·

changes in
laws or regulations affecting our operations;

 

·

changes in
our business tactics or strategies;

 

·

acquisitions
of new operations;

 

·

changing
market forces or contingencies that necessitate, in our judgment,
changes in our plans, strategy or tactics; and

 

·

fluctuations
in the investment markets or interest rates, which might materially
affect our operations or financial condition.

 

We cannot
assure you that the expectations or beliefs reflected in these
forward-looking statements will prove correct. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events
or otherwise. You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such
forward-looking statements when evaluating the information
presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

All
references in this Annual Report to the “Company”,
“Apollo”, “we”, “us” or
“our” are to Apollo Acquisition Corporation.

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS 

  

General

  

We are a
development stage company formed under the laws of the Cayman
Islands on September 27, 2006, solely for the purpose of
identifying and entering into a business combination with a
privately held business or company, domiciled and operating in an
emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly
held corporation whose stock is eventually traded on a major United
States stock exchange. We intend to focus on targets located
primarily in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, as we believe
that businesses with operating history and growth potential in
these locations would benefit significantly from access to the
United States capital markets and may offer the potential of
capital appreciation stemming from the economic growth in such
emerging markets.

  

Plan of
Operation

  

We have
not engaged in any business activities that generate revenue. Our
activities to date have been primarily focused upon raising
capital. We have conducted private offerings of our ordinary
shares, the proceeds of which we use for payment of costs
associated with accounting and auditing fees, legal fees,
identifying acquisition targets and completing necessary due
diligence. In addition, we incur costs related to filing periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.      We believe we will be able
to meet these costs for at least the next 12 months by obtaining
loans from our shareholders, management or other
investors.

  

We may
consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a
developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into
new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or
service or is an established business which may be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional
capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the
acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need
substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a
public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other
things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting
control which may occur in a public offering.

 

Narrative
Description of Business

  

Although
we have not identified or entered into any agreements with a
potential target business to date, we intend to focus on targets
located primarily in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, as we
believe that businesses with operating history and growth potential
in these locations could benefit significantly from access to the
United States capital markets and may offer the potential of
capital appreciation stemming from economic growth in such emerging
markets.

  

The
analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under
the supervision of our officer and directors who will have a large
amount of flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in
potential business opportunities. In our efforts to analyze
potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds
of factors:

  

·

Potential
for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market
expansion or new products; 

 

·

Competitive
position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience
within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a
whole; 

 

·

Strength
and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for
recruitment; 
  

 

·

Capital
requirements and anticipated availability of required funds;


 

·

The extent
to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 

 

·

The
accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw
materials, services, professional assistance and other required
items; and 

 

·

Other
relevant factors.




5

 

  

 

 

 

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be
controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and
circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable
investigative measures and available data. Potentially available
business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and
at various stages of development, all of which will make the task
of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complex. If necessary, we
will retain third party consultants to aid us in our evaluation of
potential targets, provided that we have the necessary capital
available.

  

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be
complex and extremely risky. In addition, we believe that as a
result of general economic conditions, shortages of available
capital, the attractiveness of obtaining access to United States
capital markets, and the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly
traded company, that there may be numerous firms seeking business
combination partners such as ourselves, thus adding to the
complexity 
 .

 

Competition


 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may
encounter intense competition from other entities having a business
objective similar to ours. There are numerous blank check companies
that have gone public in the United States that have significant
financial resources, that are seeking to carry out a business plan
similar to our business plan. Furthermore, there are a number of
additional blank check companies that are still in the registration
process or are about to file registration statements, both under
the Securities and Exchange Act and under the Securities Act.
Additionally, we may be subject to competition from other companies
looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a
target business. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these
competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when
contrasted with those of many of these competitors. 

 

While we
believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we
could acquire with our currently available funds, our ability to
compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be
limited by our available financial resources. This inherent
competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. 

 

Our
management believes, however, that our status as a reporting entity
and potential access to the United States public equity markets may
give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having
a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business
with significant growth potential on favorable terms. We also
believe that because we are incorporated in the Cayman Islands we
may be attractive from a tax perspective to potential targets
operating outside of the United States, as the majority of
non-operating companies that are seeking reverse merger candidates
are incorporated in the United States, which potentially adds an
additional layer of taxation. 

 

Further,
if we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be,
in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the
target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a
business combination, we will have the resources or ability to
compete effectively. 

 

Forms of
Acquisition 

 

The
structure of a potential business combination, either through an
acquisition or a merger, will depend upon a number of factors,
including the nature of the target entity’s ownership
structure, its business structure and the relative negotiating
strengths of the parties to the transaction. It is our intention to
structure a business combination so that the consideration we offer
the owners of the target company consists primarily of ordinary
shares. Such a structure provides the benefit of conserving our
capital, but has the potential drawback of resulting in our current
shareholders no longer having control of a majority of our voting
ordinary shares following such a transaction. 

 

If a
business combination is structured as an acquisition, we may be
able to structure the transaction so that the vote or approval by
our shareholders is not required. If a business combination is
structured as merger, then we may be required to call a
shareholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding ordinary shares. The necessity to
obtain such shareholder approval may result in delay and additional
expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and may
also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting
shareholders. Accordingly, we will seek to structure any such
transaction so as not to require shareholder approval.
 




6

 

  

 

 

 

We
currently anticipate that we will be able to effect only one
business combination, due primarily to our limited financing, and
the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders,
which is likely to occur if we offer our ordinary shares to obtain
a target business. This lack of diversification should be
considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will
not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against
gains from another. 

 

Employees


 

We
presently have no employees apart from our officers. Our officers
are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they
will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition
of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect
no significant changes in the number of our employees other than
such changes, if any, incident to a business
combination.

 

We intend
to hire additional management and other support personnel when we
have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for
such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to
assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition
opportunities. 
   

   

Enforceability
of Civil Liabilities 
  

 

We are
incorporated in the Cayman Islands because our management believes
that incorporation in the Cayman Islands offer a number of
benefits, including, but not limited to, the following:

  

·

political
and economic stability; 

 

·

an
effective judicial system; 

 

·

a
favorable tax system; 

 

·

the
absence of exchange control or currency restrictions; and


 

·

the
availability of professional and support services.

  

However,
certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the Cayman
Islands. These disadvantages include:

  

·

a less
developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States
and significantly less protection to investors; and

  

·

Cayman
Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal
courts of the United States.

  

We have
been advised that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of
the Cayman Islands would: 

 

·

recognize
or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or
our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state
in the United States; or 

 

·

entertain
original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or China against us
or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of
the United States or any state in the United States.

  

We have
been advised that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or
state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is
payable, other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines,
penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement
proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands under the
common law doctrine of obligation. 

 

Reports
to Security Holders

 

We are
required to file annual, quarterly and current reports and other
information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports,
statement or other information that we file with the SEC at the
SEC's public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C.
20549. Please call the SEC at (202) 551-8090 for further
information on the public reference room. These SEC filings are
also available to the public from commercial document retrieval
services and at the Internet site maintained by the SEC at
http://www.sec.gov .

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS

  

AN
INVESTMENT IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS BEFORE
DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS
ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH WOULD LIKELY SUFFER. AS A
RESULT, YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR
COMPANY. 

 

We are a
development stage company with no operating history and,
accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our
ability to achieve our business objective.

  

Because
we are a recently formed development stage company with no
operations and/or functions to date, you will have no basis upon
which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective,
which is to acquire an operating business. We have not conducted
any negotiations regarding acquisitions and we have no current
plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective
acquisition candidates.

  

We are
dependent on the ability of management to locate, attract and
effectuate a suitable acquisition candidate; management intends to
devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target
company.

  

The
nature of our operations is highly speculative and there is a
consequent risk of loss of your investment. The success of our plan
of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations,
financial condition and management of an identified business
opportunity. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in
locating candidates with established operating histories. In the
event we complete a business combination with a privately held
company, the success of our operations may be dependent upon
management of the successor firm and numerous other factors beyond
our control. While seeking a business combination, management
anticipates devoting no more than a few hours per week to the
Company’s affairs. Our officers have not entered into written
employment agreements with us and are not expected to do so in the
foreseeable future. This limited commitment may adversely impact
our ability to identify and consummate a successful business
combination.

  

There is
no public market for our ordinary shares.

  

There is
no public trading market for our ordinary shares and none is
expected to develop unless and until, among other things, we
complete an acquisition, file a selling shareholder registration
statement under the Securities Act, and such ordinary shares are
accepted for trading on a trading medium in the United States, the
occurrence of any of which no assurances can be given when, if, or
ever.

  

Because
of our limited resources and intense competition for private
companies suitable for an acquisition of the type contemplated by
management, we may not be able to consummate an acquisition on
suitable terms, if at all.

  

We expect
to encounter intense competition from other entities having
business objectives similar to ours. The highly competitive market
for the small number of business opportunities could reduce the
likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. Many
of the entities that we will be in competition with are well
established and have extensive experience in identifying and
effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. A
large number of established and well-financed entities, including
small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in
mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target
candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly
greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial
capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive
disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and
successfully completing a business combination. These competitive
factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and
consummating a successful business combination.

   

We have
no agreements for a business combination or other
transaction.

  

We have
no arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging
in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of, a private
or public entity. No assurances can be given that we will
successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities
or that we will conclude a business combination. Management has not
identified any particular industry or specific business within an
industry for evaluation. We cannot guarantee that we will be able
to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms, and there
is consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our
shares will not be invested in a company with active business
operations.




8

 

  

 

 

  

Management
intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target
company which may adversely impact our ability to identify a
suitable acquisition candidate.  

 

While
seeking a business combination, management anticipates devoting no
more than a few hours per week to the Company's affairs in total.
Our officer has not entered into a written employment agreement
with us and is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future.
This limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to
identify and consummate a successful business
combination.

  

The time
and cost of preparing a private company to become a public
reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or
acquisition with the most attractive private
companies.

  

Target
companies that fail to comply with SEC reporting requirements may
delay or preclude acquisition. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide certain
information about significant acquisitions, including certified
financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two,
or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition.
The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target
entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or
essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition. Otherwise
suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to
obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for
acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act are applicable. 

  

Our
business will have no revenues unless and until we merge with or
acquire an operating business.

  

We are a
development stage company and have had no revenues from operations.
We may not realize any revenues unless and until we successfully
merge with or acquire an operating business. Further, we anticipate
that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the
negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements,
disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial
management time and attention require the expenditure of
significant financial resources. If we decide not to participate in
a specific business opportunity, or if we fail to consummate a
business combination, the costs incurred by us related to a
transaction may result in the loss of the related costs
incurred. 

 

We may
require additional funds in order to operate a business that we
acquire.

  

Any
target business that is selected may be a financially unstable
company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth,
including entities without established records of sales or
earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks
inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and
early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we
may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry
characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target
business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain
or assess all significant risks. If we obtain a business that
requires additional capital that we cannot provide, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business and could result in the
loss of your entire investment.   

 

We expect
to issue additional ordinary shares in a merger or acquisition,
which will result in substantial dilution.

  

Our
Memorandum of Association authorizes the issuance of a maximum of
39,062,500 ordinary shares. Any merger or acquisition effected by
us may result in the issuance of additional securities without
shareholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the
percentage of our ordinary shares held by our then existing
shareholders.

  

We have
not conducted any market research or identified business
opportunities, which may affect our ability to identify a business
to merge with or acquire.

  

We have
neither conducted nor have others made available to us results of
market research concerning prospective business opportunities.
Therefore, we have no assurances that market demand exists for a
merger or acquisition as contemplated by us. Our management has not
identified any specific business combination or other transactions
for formal evaluation by us, such that it may be expected that any
such target business or transaction will present such a level of
risk that conventional private or public offerings of securities or
conventional bank financing will not be available. There is no
assurance that we will be able to acquire a business opportunity on
terms favorable to us. Decisions as to which business opportunity
to participate in will be unilaterally made by our management,
which may act without the consent, vote or approval of our
shareholders.

We cannot
assure you that, following a business combination with an operating
business, our ordinary shares will be listed on NASDAQ or any other
securities exchange.  

 

Following
a business combination, we may seek the listing of our ordinary
shares on NASDAQ or another stock exchange. However, we cannot
assure you that following such a transaction, we will be able to
meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other
stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of
our ordinary shares on either of those or any other stock exchange.
After completing a business combination, until our ordinary shares
are listed on the NASDAQ or another stock exchange, we expect that
our ordinary shares would be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin
Board, another over-the-counter quotation system, or on the
“pink sheets,” where our shareholders may find it more
difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to
the market value of our ordinary shares. In addition, we would be
subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet the criteria set
forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on
broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors.
Consequently, such rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending
or selling our ordinary shares, which may further affect its
liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise
additional capital following a business combination.

   

Our
shareholders may face different considerations in protecting their
interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands
law.  

 

Our
corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of
Association, by the Companies Law (as revised) of the Cayman
Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of
shareholders to take action against our directors, actions by
minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our
directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent
governed by the common law of Cayman Islands. The common law in the
Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited
judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands and from English common
law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but
are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. Cayman Islands
law relating to the right of shareholders and the fiduciary duties
of our directors may not be as established and may differ from
provision under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
jurisdictions in the United States. As a result, our public
shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests
in actions against the management, directors or our controlling
shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated
in a jurisdiction in the United States.

  

Judgments
against us may be difficult or impossible to enforce in foreign
jurisdictions.  

 

We are a
Cayman Islands company and a substantial majority of our assets are
located outside the U.S. In addition, a majority of our directors
and officers reside outside the U.S. As a result, it may not be
possible to effect service of process within the U.S. upon such
persons, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. or
foreign securities or other applicable laws. There is uncertainty
as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong or China
would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts
obtained against us or such persons based upon the civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States, or be
competent to hear original actions based upon these laws. In
addition, any judgments obtained in the U.S. against us, including
judgments predicated on the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, may be
not collectible within the U.S. Moreover, China does not have
treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments of courts within the U.S., Japan or most western
countries. Hong Kong has no arrangement for the reciprocal
enforcement of judgments within the U.S. As a result, if you intend
to enforce a judgment obtained in the U.S. against our assets
located outside the U.S., such judgment may be subject to
re-examination of the merits of the action by a foreign court and
face additional procedures and other difficulties which would not
be required for enforcement of such judgment in the U.S. Enforcing
such judgments may be difficult or impossible.

  

If we
effect a business combination with a company located outside of the
United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks
that may negatively impact our operations.  

 

We intend
to effect a business combination with a company located outside of
the United States. If we do so, we could be subject to special
considerations and/or risks associated with companies operating in
the target business’ home jurisdiction, including any of the
following:

  

·

rules and
regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes
on individuals; 

 

·

tariffs
and trade barriers; 

 

·

regulations
related to customs and import/export matters; 

 

·

longer
payment cycles; 




10

 

  

 

 

 

·

tax
issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as
compared to the United States;

 


·

currency
fluctuations; 

 

·

challenges
in collecting accounts receivable; 

 

·

cultural
and language differences; and 

 

·

employment
regulations. 

  

We cannot
assure you that we would be able to adequately address these
additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations, and
those of the business that we acquired, could be materially
adversely affected. 

  

If we
effect a business combination with a company located outside of the
United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely
govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to
enforce our legal rights.

   

If we
effect a business combination with a company located outside of the
United States, the laws of the country in which such company
operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating
to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business
will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that
remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of
laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may
not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the
United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under
any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of
business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we
acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is
likely that substantially all of our assets would be located
outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors
might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not
be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their
legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or
officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated
upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and
officers under Federal securities laws.  

 

Authorization
of Preference Shares.

  

Our
Memorandum of Association authorizes the issuance of up to 781,250
preference shares with designations, rights and preferences
determined from time to time by our board of directors.
Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without
shareholder approval, to issue preference shares with dividend,
liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights which could
adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of
our ordinary shares. In the event of issuance, the preference
shares could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method
of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our
Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any
preference shares, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in
the future.

  

We may
become a passive foreign investment company, which could result in
adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S.
investors. 


 

Based on
the nature of our business, we do not expect to be a passive
foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes for our current taxable year. However, whether or not we
are a PFIC for any taxable year will be based in part on the
character of our income and assets and the value of our assets from
time to time, which will be based in part on the trading price of
our ordinary shares, once they commence trading, which may be
volatile. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be a PFIC for any
taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year
during which a U.S. investor held an ordinary share, certain
adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to the
U.S. investor. 


 

If we
effect a business combination with a United States corporation we
could face adverse tax effects under the United States tax
laws.

  

Although
we currently intend to focus on Asia, South America and Eastern
Europe for potential business combination targets, if we were to
effect a business combination with a U.S. corporation, such a
combination could subject us to potentially adverse tax effects as
a result of changes made to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 relating to
the treatment of domestic business entities which expatriate from
the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. These new provisions
generally apply to the direct or indirect acquisition of
substantially all of the properties of a domestic enterprise by a
foreign corporation if there is at least 60% or 80% of continuing
share ownership in the successor foreign entity by the former
stockholders of the U.S. corporation and substantial business
activities are not conducted in the jurisdiction in which such
successor is created or organized. In the event we effected a
business combination with a U.S. corporation, and were subsequently
subject to these new rules, it could cause us to lose certain tax
benefits, which could make the transaction more expensive to us,
which could have an adverse effect on our operations.




11

 

  

 

 

   

If we are
deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, we may be
subject to certain U.S. income tax risks associated with the CFC
rules under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

  

We will
be considered a CFC for any year in which our United States
shareholders that each own (directly, indirectly or by attribution)
at least 10% of our voting shares (each a “10% U.S.
Holder”) together own more than 50% of the total combined
voting power of all classes of our voting shares or more than 50%
of the total value of our shares. If we were classified as a CFC,
such classification would have many complex results, one of which
is that if you are a 10% U.S. Holder on the last day of our taxable
year, you will be required to recognize as ordinary income your pro
rata share of certain of our income (including both ordinary
earnings and capital gains) for the taxable year, whether or not
you receive any distributions on your ordinary shares during that
taxable year.

  

If we are
deemed to be a CFC in the future, these rules would then apply to
holders of our ordinary shares. Accordingly, U.S. persons should
consider the possible application of the CFC rules before making an
investment in our ordinary shares.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Disclosure
Regarding Forward Looking Statements

 

Statements,
other than historical facts, contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, including statements of potential acquisitions and our
strategies, plans and objectives, are "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Although we
believe that our forward looking statements are based on reasonable
assumptions, we caution that such statements are subject to a wide
range of risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected. Among those
risks, trends and uncertainties are important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking
statements, including, but not limited to; the effect of existing
and future laws, governmental regulations and the political and
economic climate of the United States; the effect of derivative
activities; and conditions in the capital markets. We undertake no
duty to update or revise these forward-looking
statements.

 

When used
in this Form 10-K, the words, "expect," "anticipate," "intend,"
"plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all
forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Because
these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties,
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements for a number of
important reasons.

 

General

 

We are a
development stage company formed solely for the purpose of
identifying and entering into a business combination with a
privately held business or company, domiciled and operating in an
emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly
held corporation whose stock is eventually traded on a major United
States stock exchange. We intend to focus on targets located
primarily in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, as we believe
that businesses with operating history and growth potential in
these locations would benefit significantly from access to the
United States capital markets and may offer the potential of
capital appreciation stemming from the economic growth in such
emerging markets.

 

Plan of
Operation

 

We have
not engaged in any business activities that generate revenue. Our
activities to date have been primarily focused upon raising
capital. We have conducted private offerings of our ordinary
shares, the proceeds of which we intend to use for payment of costs
associated with accounting and auditing fees, legal fees,
identifying acquisition targets and completing necessary due
diligence. In addition, we incur costs related to filing periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe we
will be able to meet these costs for at least the next 12 months by
obtaining loans from our shareholders, management or other
investors.

 

We may
consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a
developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into
new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or
service, or is an established business which may be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional
capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the
acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need
substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a
public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other
things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting
control which may occur in a public offering.

Results of
Operations

 

Year ended
June 30, 2016, compared to Year Ended June 30,
2015

 

Operating
Expenses

 

Because
we currently do not have any business operations, we have not had
any revenues during the period of inception through June 30, 2016.
Total expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 decreased from
$165,766 for the year ended June 30, 2015 to $26,844 for the year
ended June 30, 2016. The primary reason for this decrease was a
decrease in professional fees related to legal and auditing
service.

  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

As of
June 30, 2016, we have a cash balance of $11,477. The Company is
actively pursuing merger opportunities as described in the
“General” Section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis.

 

Assuming
we do not complete a business combination, we anticipate needing
approximately $50,000 in order to effectively execute our business
plan over the next 12 months. If we are unable to raise the funds,
we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings
from institutions or private individuals. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to keep costs from being more than these
estimated amounts or that we will be able to raise such funds. We
expect that we will seek additional financing in the future.
However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or
generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we are
unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to
fund our operations, we may be forced to seek a buyer for our
business or another entity with which we could create a joint
venture. If all of these alternatives fail, we expect that we will
be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable
bankruptcy laws.

 

Our
independent auditor has expressed doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern and believes that our ability is
dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise
capital and generate revenues. See Note 3 of our financial
statements.

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

 

We
regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we
use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of
these policies is included in the notes to our financial
statements. In general, management's estimates are based on
historical experience, on information from third party
professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results
could differ from those estimates made by management.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

We have
implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.
These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the
financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that
have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.

 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

 

We have
no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to our
stockholders.

 

Contractual
Obligations

 

None.

financial statements of the Company, including the notes thereto
and report of the independent auditors thereon, are included in

Statements.” See F-1 for Index to Financial
Statements.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

As of
June 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our principal executive officer and
our principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on
this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this report.

 

Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

 

Our
management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that:

Rackspace Enters Into a $4.3 Billion Transaction to Become a Private Company through an Acquisition Led by Certain Funds Managed by Affiliates of Apollo Global Management
Rackspace stockholders to receive $32.00 per share in cash. 

Transaction expected to provide Rackspace with additional flexibility to deliver the multi- cloud services that customers seek. 

Deal expected to close in Q4 2016.

By Brandon Brunson -  August 26, 2016 












SAN ANTONIO – Aug. 26, 2016 – Rackspace (NYSE: RAX), the #1 managed cloud company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of certain funds (the “Apollo Funds”) managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Apollo”) (NYSE: APO), a leading global alternative investment manager, to be acquired for $32.00 per share in cash. In connection with the transaction, funds managed by Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. will make a strategic equity investment in the acquired company. The transaction has a total value of $4.3 billion, which includes the assumption of $43 million of net cash. Upon completion of the transaction, Rackspace will become a privately held company.
The $32.00 per share cash consideration represents a premium of 38% when compared to Rackspace’s unaffected closing stock price on August 3, 2016, the last trading
day prior to news reports speculating about a potential transaction. The Rackspace board of directors unanimously approved the agreement with the Apollo Funds and recommends that Rackspace stockholders vote in favor of the transaction.
Graham Weston, co-founder and chairman of the board of Rackspace, commented, “This transaction is the result of diligent analysis and thoughtful strategic deliberations by our board over many months. Our board, with the assistance of independent advisors, determined that this transaction, upon closing, will deliver immediate, significant and certain cash value to our stockholders. We are also excited that this transaction will provide Rackspace with more flexibility to manage the business for long- term growth and enhance our product offerings. We are confident that as a private company, Rackspace will be best positioned to capitalize on our early leadership of the fast-growing managed cloud services industry.”
Taylor Rhodes, president and CEO of Rackspace, said, “We are presented with a significant opportunity today as mainstream companies move their computing out of corporate data centers and into multi-cloud models. Apollo and its partners take a patient, value-oriented approach to their funds’ investments, and value Rackspace’s strategy and unique culture. This is an exciting transaction for Rackspace and we look forward to working closely together.”






“We are tremendously excited about the opportunity for our managed funds to acquire Rackspace,” said David Sambur, Partner at Apollo. “We have great respect for the company’s talented employees and their commitment to deliver expertise and exceptional service for the world’s leading cloud platforms. We look forward to working with Taylor and the entire management team and Searchlight to help advance Rackspace’s strategy and continue the company’s strong heritage of innovation.”
Transaction Details
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. The transaction is subject to the conclusion of the applicable antitrust waiting periods in the United States, the European Union and Israel, stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.
Advisors and Financing Providers
Financing is being provided by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Royal Bank of Canada. PSP Investments Credit USA LLC has also committed to provide a portion of the financing. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and RBC Capital Markets, LLC are acting as financial advisors to Apollo and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is acting as legal advisor to Apollo.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as financial advisor to Rackspace and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation is acting as its legal advisor. Morgan Stanley also provided services in connection with the transaction.

My son heard that Rackspace has been acquired by another company, and the information sessions/training have been suspended or terminated.  He wants to pay to take the training to become certified, so he can apply for a position with Rackspace.  Could you please let me know if the training will continue, and if so, whom should he contact and how to find out more information about the training.  Thanks.
