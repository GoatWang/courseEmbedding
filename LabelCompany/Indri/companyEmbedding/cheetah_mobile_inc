History[edit]
Formation[edit]
The company was established in 2010 as a merger of Kingsoft Security and Conew Image,[3] and grew to be the second-largest internet security software provider in China, according to iResearch.[4] The company is located at 1st Yaojiayuan South Rd, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2014, Cheetah Mobile launched an IPO selling 12 million American Depositary Shares at US$14 per share, and thereby raised US$168 million.[5] The IPO was managed by Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and Credit Suisse Group.[6] Kingsoft and Tencent are major investors in Cheetah Mobile, holding 54% and 18% respectively.[7]
Post IPO[edit]
In the late 2015, Cheetah Mobile announced that it had entered into a global strategic partnership with Yahoo. The company incorporated Yahoo’s search and native advertising platforms within its own apps. As a result of this, Cheetah Mobile stated that its revenue generated from Yahoo increased by 30 percent daily within the first two weeks.[8]
In February 2016, Cheetah Mobile and Cubot launched the CheetahPhone,[9] an Android 6.0 Marshmallow based smartphone, at MWC in Barcelona, Spain.[10]
Acquisition[edit]
On August 2, 2016, Cheetah Mobile announced its acquisition of a French startup News Republic for $57 million. News Republic is a news aggregator.[11][12]

Controversies[edit]
Despite the popularity of its Clean Master Android App, it was reported in 2014 that ads promoting Clean Master manipulate Android users with deceptive tactics when browsing websites within the app's advertising framework. In April 2014, Ferenc László Nagy from Sophos Labs captured some pop-up ads that led to Clean Master, warning the device had been infected with a virus.[35]
In July 2014, Cheetah Mobile encouraged users to uninstall Google Chrome and replace it with Cheetah Mobile's own browser during Clean Master's clean up and optimization process. This rogue practice allowed Cheetah Mobile to gain unfair position in the marketplace and led to a Google crackdown.[36]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
The company was established in 2010 as a merger of Kingsoft Security and Conew Image,[3] and grew to be the second-largest internet security software provider in China, according to iResearch.[4] The company is located at 1st Yaojiayuan South Rd, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China.
Initial public offering[edit]
In 2014, Cheetah Mobile launched an IPO selling 12 million American Depositary Shares at US$14 per share, and thereby raised US$168 million.[5] The IPO was managed by Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and Credit Suisse Group.[6] Kingsoft and Tencent are major investors in Cheetah Mobile, holding 54% and 18% respectively.[7]
Post IPO[edit]
In the late 2015, Cheetah Mobile announced that it had entered into a global strategic partnership with Yahoo. The company incorporated Yahoo’s search and native advertising platforms within its own apps. As a result of this, Cheetah Mobile stated that its revenue generated from Yahoo increased by 30 percent daily within the first two weeks.[8]
In February 2016, Cheetah Mobile and Cubot launched the CheetahPhone,[9] an Android 6.0 Marshmallow based smartphone, at MWC in Barcelona, Spain.[10]
Acquisition[edit]
On August 2, 2016, Cheetah Mobile announced its acquisition of a French startup News Republic for $57 million. News Republic is a news aggregator.[11][12]

Controversies[edit]
Despite the popularity of its Clean Master Android App, it was reported in 2014 that ads promoting Clean Master manipulate Android users with deceptive tactics when browsing websites within the app's advertising framework. In April 2014, Ferenc László Nagy from Sophos Labs captured some pop-up ads that led to Clean Master, warning the device had been infected with a virus.[35]
In July 2014, Cheetah Mobile encouraged users to uninstall Google Chrome and replace it with Cheetah Mobile's own browser during Clean Master's clean up and optimization process. This rogue practice allowed Cheetah Mobile to gain unfair position in the marketplace and led to a Google crackdown.[36]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
