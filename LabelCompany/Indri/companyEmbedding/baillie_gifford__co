                Accessibility
            


We recognise the importance of making our website accessible for all our users.  The following details how we have approached accessibility on www.bailliegifford.com.  
 
Navigation
All areas of our website are available through accessible links. Any user who has javascript disabled will be able to access all areas of the site regardless. Our navigation is accessible through screen readers to make it available to all users.
 
Headings and navigation menus
HTML heading tags are used to convey document structure. H1 tags are used for main titles, H2 tags for subtitles etc.
Navigation menus are marked up as HTML lists. This ensures that the number of links in the list is read out at the start and it can be skipped easily.
 
Images
All images used in this site include descriptive alt tag attributes. Where an image has no use other than being decorative the alt tag is set to null to allow easy reading of the site by all users.
 
Colours
We have taken care to ensure that the site's font and background colour combinations contrast significantly and are effective in ensuring information is still clear when viewed in different colour combinations.
If you wish to override the site's colours, you can do this by changing your browser settings to your own preference.
 
Font size
Most of the font sizes we use on our site are sizable. You can change the font size to make it either larger or smaller via your browser settings.
You can change the font size in the following ways depending on your browser;

In Internet Explorer; select View, then Text Size, and then your preferred size.
In FireFox; select View, then Zoom, and then Zoom in or Zoom out to alter the text size.
In Safari; click on display icon (top right) and select Zoom, Click Zoom in or Zoom out to change font size.

 
Stylesheets
This site uses cascading style sheets for all visual layout. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the use of structured semantic mark up ensures that the content of each page is still readable and clearly structured.
You can apply your own stylesheet onto this website by;

Internet Explorer; select Tools, then Internet Options, then Accessibility, next click on any or all 3 checkboxes to ignore colours, font styles or font sizes, in the same window you can change your style sheet by clicking the checkbox that says, 'format document using my style sheet' then browse to your style sheet and click OK.

In Safari; click on the Develop in the main menu and Disable Styles.
Note: If the Develop Menu item isn’t available on the main menu, then Select preferences in the Display a Menu of General Safari Settings and click on Preferences. Select the Advanced Tab and click on Show Develop menu in bar

 
Tables
Most data tables have properly scoped header cells, to allow screen readers to render them intelligently. We have also ensured table summaries are used as well as captions where appropriate. Tables used for layout use none of the above attributes to ensure that they are not confused with data tables.
 
Forms and fields
All forms fields follow a logical tab sequence to ensure easy navigation.
Most form fields also have ‘label’ and ‘id’ attributes to explicitly associate the form field with its label to allow for easy entry of data.
 
JavaScript
This site uses JavaScript to render some areas of the site, including tools and navigation items. Where it is used all pages and process are still accessible should Javascript be turned off.
 
Links
All links have been written to make sense when taken out of context. Where appropriate, we have also added link title attributes to describe the link in greater detail.
 
Copy
Abbreviation and acronym tags have been used where appropriate to ensure abbreviations and acronyms are given a full textual explanation.
We have also ensured that blockquotes are only ever used for identifying quotations. They are not used for formatting purposes.

Contact the Elderly | About Us | Baillie Gifford



























Contact the Elderly








Contact the Elderly

Each year Baillie Gifford invites staff to nominate a small local charity as its Charity of the Year. Nominations are only accepted for small charities where Baillie Gifford's support will make a real impact on the services they provide. A shortlist is produced, and staff then vote for the charity they would like the firm to support.
The chosen charity for 2015/16 was Contact the Elderly, a local charity dedicated to tackling loneliness and isolation among older people.
The backbone of Contact the Elderly is its volunteers, who host the tea parties and drive the elderly to and from each event. This includes a number of staff from Baillie Gifford, some of whom spoke about their experience of volunteering for the charity
















You can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to.






Hannah Dobson – Compliance Analyst
“I was really nervous when I picked up my guests for the first time, but I had no need to be. We had lots to chat about and there was so much laughter – it was like we had known each other for years.
“It’s fantastic to see the older guests connect with each other. In fact, two of the ladies I pick up went to school together and hadn’t seen each other for around 75 years until they attended the same tea party. They still recognised each other after all that time and they instantly connected over past friendship.
“You can tell that these parties mean so much to the guests and it’s something they clearly look forward to.”
Tracey Squires – Compliance Policies and Training Co-ordinator
“I have wanted to volunteer for a long time, but I struggled to find something that wasn’t too time intensive. Since the Contact the Elderly tea parties only take place once a month, it’s perfect for me as it’s not too much of a time commitment.
“The older people love telling us stories from their youth, and last week when I was in the car with one of the guests, we drove past the church where she got married in 1948. It’s a real honour to be in the company of people who have done so much in their lives.
“We are all going to get older and it’s nice to know that Contact the Elderly is there, looking out for us and our loved ones. I think that’s why the charity resonates with so many people.”
Jessie Wilson – Client Service Manager
“I’ve only recently become a driver for Contact the Elderly. Lack of free time previously held me back from volunteering but being a driver for the charity only involves a few hours once a month.
“It’s been amazing to see the elderly guests get out of the house and be in the company of a group of people, enjoying some conversation.
“I find volunteering for Contact the Elderly very enjoyable, so it doesn’t feel like I’m going out of my way to help people. It has given me the opportunity to meet some lovely people, who have great life stories, all while I get to enjoy eating some cake, too!”
Máirín Eydmann – Project Manager
“I was part of the Baillie Gifford Habitat for Humanity team last year, which was a great experience. I really enjoyed going to Ethiopia and working with the local community. The experience made me want to seek out an opportunity to work with my local community in Edinburgh.
“When I heard that Contact the Elderly was looking for volunteers, it seemed like a good fit for me. I’m a keen baker, so hosting tea parties meant that I could combine my enthusiasm for baking with volunteering.
“I also enjoy socialising with our elderly neighbours, so extending that to tea party guests was the natural thing for me to do. And volunteering for Contact the Elderly is no hardship. I get to have great conversations with the group and eat cake. It’s a fantastic way to spend a Sunday afternoon.”
Dorothy Green – Receptionist
“I had been thinking about volunteering for a while, so when Contact the Elderly became our charity of the year, it seemed like the ideal opportunity.
“I’m so glad I got involved with the charity. I am now the driver of a lovely 90-year-old lady and together we go along to a tea party hosted by a Baillie Gifford volunteer, one Sunday each month.
“There are six older ladies in the group along with six Baillie Gifford drivers plus the host and we spend two hours chatting over cups of tea and delicious cakes. The whole process is very rewarding, and above all enjoyable. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who might be considering volunteering.”
Sarah Mitchell – Investment Assistant
“I was keen to get involved in some charity work in my local area when I heard about Contact the Elderly through Baillie Gifford.
“I’m a volunteer driver for a lovely lady, who is 98 years old. She had a great time at the tea party, which got her out of the house and gave her the chance to meet new people. I also really enjoyed chatting to her and hearing more about her life.
“My first tea party was great – it’s nice to spend an afternoon listening to the group’s stories. I’m already looking forward to my next tea party.”

Our Story | About Us | Baillie Gifford



























Our Story








CULTURE
In a nutshell Baillie Gifford has fostered a culture based on partnership, rigorous research methods and an investment philosophy that focuses on growth over the long term.





From our Edinburgh base, we have been able to harness this intellectually curious yet rigorous approach – where the sharing of ideas and robust debate between our investment teams is central to our investment process.
The result is a successful business that continues to grow organically. We now have £166 billion under management and advice in specialist equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for a global client base.







                FOCUS ON CLIENTS
            


We would be nothing without our clients. That may seem obvious, but can easily be overlooked. All too often the financial sector will chase new business to the detriment of existing clients.
At Baillie Gifford, existing clients’ interests are paramount and we frequently close our products to new business to ensure that the integrity of our strategies and the quality of service are maintained. This commitment to professional excellence ensures clients receive our full attention.Thanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our long-term vision to deliver the best results for our clients without the distraction of short-term shareholder demands.
This single-minded approach has enabled us to enjoy relationships with clients that have spanned generations.
Today we manage money on behalf of some of the world’s largest institutional investors. We manage international portfolios for US and Canadian clients and have a blue chip client base covering corporate, public and foundation assets. We have had Asian Clients since 1989 and we manage funds for some of Continental Europe’s leading pension funds and financial institutions.Our broad geographical exposure also encompasses institutional clients in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Korea, the Middle East and South Africa.








Thanks to our partnership structure we are free to focus entirely on our long-term vision to deliver the best results for our clients.





PARTNERSHIP
Since 1908 when Baillie Gifford was founded as an investment partnership, the firm has been wholly owned by the people who invest for and look after our clients.





Through each successive generation of partners, our singular focus on generating superior long-term investment results for our clients has been the bedrock of our own growth. Baillie Gifford today is wholly owned by its 43 partners – all of whom work within the firm. Growth has been organic, with no mergers or acquisitions, and we are committed to remaining independent.
This partnership style is rare among large investment management companies and creates one key advantage; with no external shareholders demanding short-term gains, we can focus solely on what we do best, seeking out long-term investment returns for our clients.
The organisational stability created by this ownership structure means that we can recruit and retain some of the best people in the industry.
And partnership encourages personal responsibility, creating a strong culture of questioning, debate and respectful trust in which the finest investment minds are nurtured and thrive.
This, in turn, means we can continue to find the best long-term investment opportunities. It’s a virtuous circle that has served us well for over a century.







                LONG TERM
            


Baillie Gifford are long-term investors, not speculators. Our investment philosophy focuses on growth while our universe is global. In equities, our belief is that sustained growth in company profits leads to higher share prices over time. In bonds, we take a differentiated investment approach, which focuses on long-term prospects rather than the potential for short-term price movements.
Our rigorous process of fundamental analysis and proprietary research, combined with a depth of expertise, are core to a successful, long-term, bottom-up investment approach. This allows us to exploit global opportunities over periods of, typically, five years or more. It’s a philosophy that has guided our investment strategy for 108 years, so no one can say we don’t practice what we preach.








We are not interested in following fads and fashions or pursuing short-term performance. We are active investors, driven to deliver value-added performance after fees, over the long term.





CAPABILITIES
We actively manage specialist equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for a global base. As at 30 June 2017, we have £166bn under management.





EQUITIES
In markets seduced by complexity, we believe in keeping things simple. We invest in what we believe to be the most competitive, innovative and efficient growth companies.
Over a century of global investment experience has taught us that patience is vital, so we build long-term, committed portfolios that aim to anticipate the next decade, not the next quarter. Most importantly, we love what we do and we don’t invest by rote or by numbers alone. Our analysts conduct rigorous, qualitative, fundamental analysis to determine whether to invest. We know that the equity markets may not agree with us, and that’s okay; it’s more profitable to lead than to follow, and we never stop questioning or challenging the status quo.  
FIXED INCOME
We are different. We are truly active investors, looking to construct focused portfolios of long-term investments. With a global opportunity set, we invest in government bonds and currencies, emerging market bonds, investment grade and high yield. Our highly experienced investors undertake rigorous proprietary analysis focused on fundamental investment characteristics to identify attractive opportunities around the world. We recognise that the asymmetric nature of bonds, with capped upside, makes risk management key to achieving our investment objective and it is integral to our approach.
MULTI ASSET
We don’t believe in limiting our investment opportunities. Listed equities, property, high yield credit, commodities, emerging market government bonds and insurance linked securities – these are just some of the asset classes we invest in. It is our core belief that diversifying across asset classes can reduce risk without significantly reducing returns. Maximising our investment opportunities raises the likelihood of finding individually attractive asset classes and also helps us to achieve a balanced and well-diversified portfolio. We focus only on absolute risk and absolute return, considering an asset class for its ability to enhance returns or reduce volatility. We offer our clients access to a broad mix of asset classes through the convenience of a single actively-managed portfolio.
 








From Edinburgh, our research covers the globe. We set no barriers to the imagination of our investors, encouraging fresh perspectives and the use of diverse sources of information.







                RESEARCH
            


In short, we’re curious about the world. And we truly believe that the best investment ideas spring from thinking about future possibilities, not short-term probabilities.
We appreciate of course that the world is complex but we believe that the way to generate long-term returns for our clients is to focus on the deceptively simple task of identifying and investing in those companies which have the potential to grow at a faster rate, on a more sustainable basis, than their peers.So we conduct rigorous qualitative research to establish whether prospective investments have the competitive, financial and strategic advantages to deliver on that potential. And we love to share our insights.
Our investment ideas are discussed and debated across our investment teams, from those of the most junior analysts to partners of the firm. We are always looking for that novel insight, offbeat observation or penetrating challenge to help round out the investment case and enhance our collective knowledge.
And because there are no enduring right answers in investment, we never stop asking questions.

Corporate Governance |About Us |Baillie Gifford



























Corporate Governance








Overview
Well-managed companies are more likely to make successful, long-term investments for our clients.




Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues span our investment universe. Whether it be the impact of increasing carbon legislation on fossil fuel companies or director remuneration in the banking sector, as long-term active managers we need to ensure that we are assessing the issues that are relevant, not just to the companies we invest in, but to the world as a whole.
Our dedicated Corporate Governance Team works with our fund managers to assess ESG concerns both before and after we invest in a company.
As long-term investors, we seek to build relationships with investee companies and therefore management attitudes to shareholders are important to us. We look to engage with management to discuss topics directly related to the investment case. That might include everything from strategy, capital management and board composition, to remuneration, environmental impact and reputational risk.




















I think corporate governance is absolutely central to how we go about investing at Baillie Gifford because we are bottom-up stock-pickers, we are owners of businesses rather than renters of shares.

            Vanguard Group founder John "Jack" Bogle. About 5300 km from Vanguard's headquarters in Pennsylvania, a Scottish money manager that's been around since 1908 is taking a lesson from the US behemoth to survive as a standalone firm.

For many active stock pickers, low-cost investing pioneer Vanguard Group has come to epitomise the biggest threat to their business since mutual funds were first started almost a century ago.But about 3300 miles (5310 km) from Vanguard's headquarters in Pennsylvania, a Scottish money manager that's been around since 1908 is taking a lesson from the US behemoth to survive as a standalone firm.Baillie Gifford & Co, which oversees about $US202 billion ($259 billion) out of Edinburgh, has been cutting fees to remain competitive in a low-return environment, a strategy that takes a page from Vanguard's. While peers such as cross-town rival Standard Life Investments are turning to mergers and acquisitions to weather the assault from index funds, this firm is betting that performance is still key to attracting clients including Vanguard, for which it oversees more than $US20 billion."We've learned quite a lot from Vanguard," said Charles Plowden, joint senior partner at Baillie Gifford, who's been with the asset manager for more than three decades. Cutting fees "is one part of our defense of active management".

"We're not going to be able to beat them on costs, and we are not going to try, but it's about performance after costs."

Plowden, together with two other Baillie Gifford fund managers, runs about a third of the $US5.1 billion Vanguard Global Equity Fund, which invests in stocks including some of world's largest technology companies. The fund is beating 87 per cent of peers over the past five years. Its expense ratio - the total cost of managing a fund - was 58 per cent below the average of similar money pools as of January, according to Vanguard.That success is also a model for Baillie Gifford. The firm has cut overall fees on some funds and introduced a two-tiered system on others that lowers charges above a certain threshold for assets under management. For the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, the fee falls to 25 basis points from 30 basis points for assets above 4 billion pounds ($6.7 billion).Among their bond funds, fees range from 28 to 78 basis points and for multi-asset products the company charges between 45 and 83 basis points, according to data provided by the company.Spurring imitation

Vanguard last week named Tim Buckley as chief executive officer to succeed Bill McNabb, who has helped the firm more than triple its assets since 2008."I love that everyone is following us," Buckley said Thursday. "We are here to change the way people invest and we are taking that beyond the borders of any one country."UK active stock funds have an average ongoing charge of 1.04 per cent compared with 0.44 per cent for passive, according to Morningstar. Vanguard, the world's second-biggest money manager after BlackRock, in May started an online service to sell its funds directly to UK investors, charging an annual account fee of 15 basis points and an average fund charge of 14 basis points.Active managers "will have to cut costs to compete effectively with passives but that's not sufficient", said Christopher Traulsen, a director of global ratings at Morningstar. "Too many managers launch funds into areas where money starts flowing even when they don't have much expertise in that area. They need to focus on what they do well."

The marginal rate should come down for the largest clients, Plowden said in an interview from Baillie Gifford's headquarters in Edinburgh. Clients "are putting more of their money into passive funds, but for the bit they are keeping in active, they need to get proper value for it".With record-low interest rates making it harder to eke out returns, the growing popularity of cheaper index-tracking funds has led to a wave of consolidation. Standard Life agreed to a $US5.3 billion merger with Aberdeen Asset Management. The combined company's asset-management part of the business will oversee about $US766 billion, more than three times what Baillie Gifford manages.Small packageUnlike Aberdeen, which founder Martin Gilbert built via more than 40 deals over 34 years, Baillie Gifford hasn't done a single deal in its 109-year history. Its senior partners aren't convinced by the industry's rush to create scale.

"We've heard this for years and years now, that you need to get bigger to survive in this industry," said Andrew Telfer, the joint senior partner overseeing operations. "No, you need to get better to survive."There's room in the market for boutiques that manage their costs well, said Morningstar's Traulsen. The most difficult position is being too small to get true economies of scale and too big to be considered a boutique.That doesn't mean that the firm is immune to merger speculation. Telfer says bankers are still pitching ideas in the hope he and his partners will change their minds, though it's a far cry from the 1980s, when Baillie Gifford was receiving calls from potential suitors every month.Gilbert "has been successful with this model and we've been successful with ours", Telfer said in a joint interview with Plowden. "Different business models will work, but we think we need to focus on us and making sure we're doing a good job."

History[edit]
Baillie & Gifford WS was formed in 1907[2] as a partnership between Colonel Augustus Baillie and Carlyle Gifford. Initially, it was a law firm but the financial climate of the time led to the business switching its emphasis to investment in 1908. In 1909, Baillie & Gifford created the Straits Mortgage and Trust Company Limited[3] to lend money to rubber planters in Malaya.
The Straits Mortgage and Trust Company Limited was renamed The Scottish Mortgage and Trust Limited in 1913,[4] and this was followed by the introduction of several other investment trusts. Baillie Gifford’s clients and staff emerged relatively unscathed from the First World War, and the ‘Roaring Twenties’ gave Gifford many opportunities to expand the firm’s investment business. By 1927, the transition of Baillie & Gifford WS from a firm of solicitors conducting institutional investment business to a partnership managing investment trusts was completed with the creation of Baillie Gifford & Co.[5] The firm continued to grow steadily until the outbreak of the Second World War.
Baillie died in 1939[6] and, the following year, Gifford was posted to New York on UK Government business. However, the firm survived the war and the troubled investment climate which followed. After a period of strong growth in the firm’s staff and client base, Gifford retired in 1965[7] at the age of 84. Baillie Gifford emerged from a further period of economic weakness in the UK during the 1970s with its position enhanced by growth in the amount of money it managed on behalf of clients.
Assets under management continued to grow strongly during the 1990s. The firm altered the management structure when it reverted to having joint senior partners. And, as the new millennium approached, another huge change occurred with the increased use of technology – a necessary evolution as the business expanded and the client base became increasingly complex.
By the time of its centenary in 2008, Baillie Gifford had offices in New York and London in addition to its headquarters in Edinburgh, and was managing more than £50 billion. Clients included five of the seven largest pension funds in the US and the firm had also attracted significant levels of business from Japan and Australia, as well as continuing to make inroads in other parts of the Far and Middle East.[8]
In 2015 Baillie Gifford opened an office in Hong Kong under the subsidiary Baillie Gifford Asia (Hong Kong) Limited 百利亞洲(香港)有限公司.

Baillie Gifford
How Baillie Gifford met compliance regulations
PDF download





The Customer
Location(s): Edinburgh, Scotland and New York, New York
Industry: Financial
Products: DatAdvantage
Founded over 100 years ago, Baillie Gifford is an independent investment management firm based in Edinburgh, Scotland with offices in London, England and Manhattan, USA. With just under 700 staff, the firm manages more than £58 billion (US$87 billion) in active equity and bond portfolios for its clients in the UK and throughout the world, combining experience, enthusiasm and sound judgement.
This year, and for the fourth time in 20 years, Baillie Gifford Overseas Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Baillie Gifford & Co) received the Queen’s Award for Enterprise for its success in retaining and acquiring international clients.












DatAdvantage has enabled us to remove the risks associated with data permission changes within our IT environment. Employees with responsibility for sensitive and critical data now have confidence that there are no security exposures. As an organisation, we can prove to our regulators that our IT controls are stringent and that we are providing effective protection around our data.

– Colin Lennox, Technical Services Manager, Baillie Gifford





The Challenge
Baillie Gifford has been operating for over 100 years and since its inception over 20 years ago the Information Systems department has grown organically with the firm. However, increasingly it was discovering that network permissions set five years ago, let alone before that, were no longer valid. This raised concerns that problems may exist within its security controls.
Based on a Microsoft Windows operating system, its environment comprises 250 servers – a mixture of both physical and virtual, containing 30TB of data that continues to double year on year. Of these 250 servers, ten are identified as key file servers containing sensitive data that must be protected at all costs incorporating client information and share portfolios, HR records and financial accounts. A team of ten people, based in Edinburgh, are responsible for the day to day running, security and permission management of these servers and all its 700 employees across the organisation have access, albeit with different levels of permission.
With the security and integrity of its client information paramount, Baillie Gifford needed to ensure this critical data was secure, access to it limited and that its removal from the firm was correctly managed and maintained.
To do this it used various basic windows auditing solutions. However, these tools couldn’t provide the end-to-end insight that Baillie Gifford required, in conjunction the management effort required to produce accurate reports placed a heavy burden on the IT team. Colin Lennox, Baillie Gifford’s Technical Services Manager explains, “We needed a solution that could provide evidence that the network permissions we have are secure and correctly assigned, and that any potentially excessive permissions within the environment were not exposing vulnerabilities to our data.”

As an active project, Baillie Gifford knew it needed to improve the control, visibility and manageability of its critical data. Colin adds, “We wanted to revoke obsolete permissions and accurately consolidate access rights across the whole of our data structures. To do this, we needed to see who had access permissions but more importantly who was actually using it. We could then alter permissions more effectively and without revoking access to teams who continually required access to perform their roles.
In addition, Baillie Gifford had a strategy to give ownership of permission settings back to the key data managers within the firm. It sounds a simple thing, file system permissions, but as Colin explains, “To give non-technical people an easily understandable report with actionable highlights is actually quite difficult and time intensive to produce.”
The Solution
Baillie Gifford selected DatAdvantage since it was the only solution that addressed all their data access challenges, especially in terms of meeting and proving regulatory compliance. Not only is DatAdvantage easy to install and maintain, but its standard reports along with the user interface are easy to understand. As Colin adds, “DatAdvantage was the only solution that I believed covered all our requirements for data access and permissions auditing, plus the reports it produces even a layperson could quite easily pick up, interpret and action. Plus, the inbuilt ‘traffic light’ scheme clearly identifies excessive permissions and we quickly pinpointed areas that needed to be tightened.”
The security management improvements the solution provides to the organisation were evident during the evaluation period so the investment was easily justified and approved by Baillie Gifford’s internal risk committee. Working in partnership with Varonis Technical staff, the deployment of the system was trouble free and within a month DatAdvantage had been rolled out across the whole firm.
Weekly reports are created and sent electronically to the security officer, the internal IT department and more importantly those data managers responsible for the data classification in each area. In contrast to the previous complicated paper reports, DatAdvantage provides clear change control visibility with a graphical representation of changes highlighted on a week by week, month by month basis. Its simplicity allows the data managers to navigate through the permissions themselves, resolving any issues and regaining control. Everyone responsible for data protection now has confidence that is backed up with validation that the changes happening within the business are necessary and accurate – visibility that simply would not have been attainable previously.
Testament to its success, Baillie Gifford has started to roll out DatAdvantage to its Sharepoint servers. This is providing visibility to data that the IT department previously had no visibility or insight of. More importantly, DatAdvantage is exposing any risks and providing an opportunity to tighten security permissions further. Colin added, “Although this investment was driven primarily by risk management and not by cost savings, the fact that it is now so simple for those responsible to manage permission changes, I estimate DatAdvantage has saved the organisation hundreds of man hours since its introduction.”
Business Benefits
Detailed, yet understandable, access permission reports
Historically, Baillie Gifford would need to pull complex reports from each of its 250 servers – a confusing and labour intensive process. Today, DatAdvantage brings it all together under one central interface, simplifying the process and giving a holistic view. From an end-user perspective, the easily understandable reports provide relevant information to the key data managers, improving their understanding of who has and is actually accessing their data, and addressing any vulnerabilities posed.
Complete data governance
DatAdvantage has the ability to track historic changes and highlight when they’d taken place, effectively wrapping up the change control system and providing evidence to external and internal audit teams demonstrating regulatory compliance.
Minimal overhead and continued support
Since its deployment at the beginning of the year, Baillie Gifford has been impressed by how little management overhead has been needed. The solution is robust, has minimal impact on the live environment and operates without the need for patches, management and maintenance from its IT team. Colin concludes, “Varonis has established a partnership with us, providing assistance to our staff and ensuring we continue to get the most of DatAdvantage by utilising all its capabilities effectively. If only all of our software vendors provided such great support!”

History[edit]
Baillie & Gifford WS was formed in 1907[2] as a partnership between Colonel Augustus Baillie and Carlyle Gifford. Initially, it was a law firm but the financial climate of the time led to the business switching its emphasis to investment in 1908. In 1909, Baillie & Gifford created the Straits Mortgage and Trust Company Limited[3] to lend money to rubber planters in Malaya.
The Straits Mortgage and Trust Company Limited was renamed The Scottish Mortgage and Trust Limited in 1913,[4] and this was followed by the introduction of several other investment trusts. Baillie Gifford’s clients and staff emerged relatively unscathed from the First World War, and the ‘Roaring Twenties’ gave Gifford many opportunities to expand the firm’s investment business. By 1927, the transition of Baillie & Gifford WS from a firm of solicitors conducting institutional investment business to a partnership managing investment trusts was completed with the creation of Baillie Gifford & Co.[5] The firm continued to grow steadily until the outbreak of the Second World War.
Baillie died in 1939[6] and, the following year, Gifford was posted to New York on UK Government business. However, the firm survived the war and the troubled investment climate which followed. After a period of strong growth in the firm’s staff and client base, Gifford retired in 1965[7] at the age of 84. Baillie Gifford emerged from a further period of economic weakness in the UK during the 1970s with its position enhanced by growth in the amount of money it managed on behalf of clients.
Assets under management continued to grow strongly during the 1990s. The firm altered the management structure when it reverted to having joint senior partners. And, as the new millennium approached, another huge change occurred with the increased use of technology – a necessary evolution as the business expanded and the client base became increasingly complex.
By the time of its centenary in 2008, Baillie Gifford had offices in New York and London in addition to its headquarters in Edinburgh, and was managing more than £50 billion. Clients included five of the seven largest pension funds in the US and the firm had also attracted significant levels of business from Japan and Australia, as well as continuing to make inroads in other parts of the Far and Middle East.[8]
In 2015 Baillie Gifford opened an office in Hong Kong under the subsidiary Baillie Gifford Asia (Hong Kong) Limited 百利亞洲(香港)有限公司.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
